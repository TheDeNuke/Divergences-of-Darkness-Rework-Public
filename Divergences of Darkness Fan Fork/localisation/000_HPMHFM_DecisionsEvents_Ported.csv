sedentarize_khanate_title;Sedentarise the Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sedentarize_khanate_desc;For millennia great nomadic Empires have risen and fallen, dynasties rising and fading into oblivion, but with a common political blueprint. The Khan would be the supreme authority of the Khanate, ruling over a warrior nobility organised in left and right halves of the Empire. While this ancient system has proven its fruits, it is now clear than in the present age it is unsufficient to keep the sedentary polities at bay, whose greater degree of centralisation has allowed them to encroach more and more upon the grazing lands of the Nomadic Confederations. We have no option then, but to bend against the wind of time, adopt a bureaucratic system of administration and sedentarise the different clans and tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nomadic_confederation;Nomadic Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nomadic_confederation_desc;Nomadic Confederations are highly decentralized states centered around the figure of a Khan, the warlord who reigns supreme over the 'left' (eastern) and 'right' (western) wings of the Khanate. Although this form of government has proven to be successful in the Steppes for millennia, the fact that the different nomadic clans that compose the Khanate are co-opted into providing military service limits the manpower the Khan can muster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

paternal_rebels_desc;Paternal rebels see the military as the backbone of the nation, and will stop at nothing to secure its power and influence. They arise among many other new ideologies, but are most of all a reaction to socialism. Seeing the socialists as a threat to the security of the nation, the paternals wish to seize power to prevent socialism from weakening the nation. Externally they support an aggressive military policy, and aim to prevent foreign domination. In a monarchy they will rally around the king and strengthen his power, while in a republic they will institute a dictatorship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

army_reform_to_cantonist_desc;Several European states have experimented with cantonist schools. Every regiment of the army maintains a canton school for the male children of their soldiers, said students being known as cantonists.

regional_police_decision_desc;The old system of community watchmen and disorganized deputizing of commoners to aid in the pursuit of criminals cannot continue. We need more modern methods of policing. The Kings of England and France have for centuries used Marshalcy Companies to patrol rural areas or high-security locations such as mints and royal palaces. While this system has often been decried as a sign of Plantagenet tyranny, even Marinus Dahlke admired the system and adopted it in a limited form in the Imperial Republic of Germany.

closed_border_policy_title;Close the Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
closed_border_policy_desc;A closed border is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement. These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_title;Implement Immigration Quotas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_desc;A conditionally open border is a border that allows movement of people across the border that meet a special set of conditions. This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter. Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. In the case of our country, quotas mean that no foreigners that fail a literacy test in their own language or are nationals of countries that were or are at war with our nation are allowed. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_title;Abolish Immigration Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_desc;An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border, or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border. One of the advantages of such a policy is that it requires little to none effort from the State's bureaucracy to keep control over immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

build_suez_canal_desc;One of the long standing problems for shipping on the Far Eastern and India trades has always been the need to round the African Cape in order to actually get there. By establishing a canal through the Suez, we will shorten the journey to Asia by days, as well as perform a wonderful feat of modern engineering. §RThis feat, however, is estimated to cost between 1 to 3 million pounds.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
build_kiel_canal_desc;Building a canal between the Baltic and the North Sea would be a tremendous boon to our shipping, and we are in a position to build one in Kiel. The Kiel Canal and the Danish islands, with their numerous tortuous channels, will enable $COUNTRY$ to play the game of hide-and-seek with a strong naval opponent. Besides, it will greatly strengthen $COUNTRY$'s position in the Baltic. Whereas Russia must send her ships through the Skager Rack and Kattegat, $COUNTRY$ can pass them quickly and safely through the Canal. Last, but not least, the Canal will convert the Baltic and the North Sea into a single sea as far as $COUNTRY$ goes. Kiel is an enormous harbour, but it lays on the Baltic, while Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea is too small. §RThe estimated costs are between 0.5 to 1.5 million pounds.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
build_panama_canal_desc;Proposals for a Canal across the Andagoya Isthmus probably date back to the first discovery of the area. Nowhere is the strip of land that unites the North and South American continents thinner than here, and, with the aid of modern engineering, we could shorten the travel time between the Atlantic and the Pacific by several days by building it. §RThe canal will take a long while to be built and will likely cost between 2 and 6 million pounds.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are several bills in the Upper House about its destiny, from annexation as a colony to letting them be free. The Great Powers are not sure how to proceed as the Conference recognized the old monarch as the ruler of the Congo but our close ties and already de facto administration of it gave us a prime position in deciding its fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME955190;Civilizing Congo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC955190;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ kept his word and the Congo was ran as a philanthropic and humanitarian endeavor. He drove the slavers from the Congo basin, helped the natives modernize and civilize, he kept the Congo open for trade with all the nations. A few abuses were reported here and there, but this was usually passed as corruption or power abuse. The $MONARCHTITLE$ was never involved or held liable for those. This situation, however, led to the Great Powers closely watching the Congo and an international recognition of the Congo right to exist. This means that colonizing the Congo is a path that we can no longer trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME955189;The Congo Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC955189;In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Congo Treaty, not only had the State become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. Despite all that, improvements in the Congo had been made and there was no over exploitation of the natives. Running the risk of corporations causing a humanitarian disaster because of over exploitation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ upper house decided, in a move coordinated and approved by other Great Power, to remove the $MONARCHTITLE$ as the sole personal ruler of the Congo and put it under control of $COUNTRY$ with all the legal institutions and guarantees that came with it. The corporations and the $MONARCHTITLE$ will be throughly compensated for the change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC955187;As the Congo is the private property of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$, we need to decide every three years how the country will be run for the next three years. Being too lenient and using it solely for philanthropic work might cement the country's destiny as a civilizing experiment, forever barring it from being a colony. Pushing the natives to meet the production quotas, on the other hand, might lead to abuse that can give our opposition and the humanitarian organizations some ammunition against us. While that will not hinder any plans of colonizing the Congo, it will certainly affect our reputation in the eyes of the world. The optimal solution would be maintaining balance for long enough that the philanthropic excuse doesn't collapse at the same time that our imperialistic plans for the Congo slowly become recognized and legitimized. Unfortunately for that, running the Congo is a costly affair and can easily leave us with debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

EVTNAME955186;The Congo's Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955186;With the Congo Conference coming to an end and the great powers moving in Africa according to the principle of effective occupation, the creation of the Congo Free State became a reality and the $MONARCHTITLE$'s dominance over it was internationally recognized. The $MONARCHTITLE$ pledged to suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade within the colony, impose no import duties for twenty years and to encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in $YEAR$, however, the $MONARCHTITLE$ began to issue a series of decrees that violated these conditions. It was first decreed that the State asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo. Afterwards, the rights of the Congolese were reduced in their land to native villages and farms, making nearly all of the CFS crown lands. We can continue these policies which will lead to an eventual annexation, revert them or simply take control of the CFS, dealing with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC955185;The Great Powers of the world, meeting during the Congo Conference, awarded the Congo to the International Association of the Congo, controlled by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler. They now demand that all of the agreed territory be passed on to the philanthropic organization, which includes some territory we currently control.

EVTDESC955188;'The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. The collection of hands became an end in itself. Soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber, they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs, and the soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.' The mass-deaths in the CFS became a cause célèbre in $YEAR$. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ offered to reform his regime, but international opinion supported an end to the $MONARCHTITLE$'s rule and finally, yielding to international pressure, the Upper House of $COUNTRY$ annexed the Congo Free State in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

It rocked not only Messina, but half of Sicily and all of Calabria like a raft in a storm. The first crash from the heavens reached every ear in Messina. The houses had begun to vomit terror-stricken men before even the fantastic dance of earth began. Full well did those who dwelt in the shadow of majestic but death-dealing Etna know what the artillery of the heavens portended. Science may present its theories. Those who dwell in the shadow of death have no use for them."\nAt least 91% of structures in Messina were destroyed or irreparably damaged and tens of thousands were killed. The ensuing tsunami, fires and chaos amplified the destruction, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government completely losing control over the affected areas. It was the most destructive earthquake to ever strike Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME21525;The Great Neapolitan Earthquake;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC21525;At night and centred in the town of Montemurro, an earthquake shook the province of Potenza, in southern Italy.

Scores of people died while tsunamis and fires destroyed thousands of buildings.  In Edo alone, a total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires. The earthquakes were blamed on a giant catfish, Namazu, thrashing about and Ukiyo-e prints depicting Namazu became very popular around this time. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC21523;On the evening of $YEAR$, communities along the Sanriku coast in northern Japan were celebrating a Shinto holiday. After a small earthquake, there was little concern because it was so weak and many small tremors had also been felt in the previous few months. However 35 minutes later the first tsunami wave struck the coast, followed by a second a few minutes later. The waves reached a height of 38.2m and caused such damage that the event is one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. The power of the tsunami was great: large numbers of victims were found with broken bodies or missing limbs. As was their normal practice each evening, the local fishing fleets were all at sea when the tsunamis struck. In the deep water the wave went unnoticed. Only when they returned the next morning did they discover the debris and bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC21521;Houses crumbled in the middle of the night as the earth itself threatened to rip apart. The shaking lasted for five minutes at a coastal town 70km south of Iquique. The earthquake caused significant damage over most of the coastal parts of the Iquique and Antofagasta Regions. The tsunami caused a 10m  wave along about 500km of coast, from Arica in the north to Mejillones in the south. At Arica the water reached the cathedral. The hulk of the Platagentian gunboat Wateree, which had been beached hundreds of meters inland by the final wave of the tsunami triggered by the Arica earthquake, was moved several kilometers to the north along the coast and nearer the shoreline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME21522;The $YEAR$ Arica Earthquake;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC21522;In a calm night of $YEAR$ in Arica, the earth suddenly shook and started to sunder. The earthquake shaking lasted somewhere between five and ten minutes and caused almost complete destruction in the southern part of Quito, including Arica, Tacna, Moquegua, Mollendo, Ilo, Iquique, Torata and Arequipa. Then, the first wave arrived at Arica 52 minutes after the earthquake, with a 12m height, followed by the largest 16m wave 73 minutes later. The  tsunami drove three ships anchored in port nearly 800m inland: the 1560-ton Incan corvette Ameriga, the Platagentian gunboat Wateree and the Belgian store ship Fredonia, which was completely destroyed, as well as causing considerable damage in Hawaii, washing out a bridge along the Waiohi river.

It is for a high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial."\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ delivered an impassionate speech today in $CAPITAL$, just the start of a campaign to gather support among the population and the government for their goal of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME11001;The Dissolution of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11001;Ministers and bureaucrats arrived in $CAPITAL$ today to find a royal decree at the government's doors: the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch has dissolved the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House, effective immediately, and a new one is to be handpicked by the monarch. The news sent shockwaves through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nobility - used to the occasional replacements, but not to such an earthshattering and drastic extent. Dissatisfaction is rampant, with many speculating (behind closed doors) that the monarch is setting up minor nobles, mostly sycophants and toadies, to execute the whims of the crown. A few of the old servants of the crown in the nobility kept their positions in order to train and guide the newcomers, but there's already evidence of lasting disruption in the state's affairs. The new upper house is set to have a majority of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_the_upper_house_title;Dissolve the Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#### Disrepair Events ####;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22590;$PROVINCENAME$ Old Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22590;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom. Hit with a severe economic recession in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politicians in $CAPITAL$ have no money to spend on repairing and maintaining non-essential staff and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC22592;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22591;Overgrown Railways in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22591;What once was one of the arteries of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry, the railway in $PROVINCENAME$ fell into such disrepair that it's path is barely visible and its tracks are unusable. Economic recession has hit $STATENAME$ harshly for the last years and without money from $CAPITAL$ being invested, most of the railways in $STATENAME$ are in such a state that they will need to be rebuilt to become train-worthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME900645;The Serbian Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900645;$COUNTRY$ has a reasonable issue to bring before the upcoming Congress: while it seems beyond question that the Bosnians will be given independence, we could make a case for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ stewardship over Serbia at the Congress and it seems likely we would be heeded... though it would, without a doubt, upset the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Turkish Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Turkish it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90065OPTA;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Turkish Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Turkish delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged.

EVT90067OPTA;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consensus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more.

greater_syria_desc;In the nationalist ideology developed by the founder of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, Antun Saadeh, Syria is seen as the geocultural environment in which the Syrian nation state evolved, an area Sa'adeh called the Syrian Fertile Crescent. Sa'adah rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He pointed to what he considered to be the region's distinct natural boundaries, and described it as extending from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros Mountains in the northeast, to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea -including the Sinai Peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, and from the eastern Mediterranean Sea including the island of Cyprus in the west, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically they were the majority: according to the results of the Commonwealth census of 1793, 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the Bug were Romanian. While they are not the majority anymore, the natural features of the land and the historical ties of the land to Romania means we have claims on the region, regardless if they are recognized by the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
claim_tisza_title;Claim the Tisa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_tisza_desc;Once called "The most Hungarian river" because it flowed entirely within the Kingdom of Hungary, today it crosses several national borders.

GRQ_nambia_desc;It is clear that Africa is becoming more and more interesting to the colonial powers of Europe. From their outposts on the coast, explorers are heading inland and merchants are looking for new markets to exploit. Whilst not a interesting region per say, Dorsland would make for a excellent outpost and naval base, not withstanding the potential influence over our economy trough control over our imports and exports. If we wish to establish control over the land, we must make our move now, before a European power does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GRQ_hereroland_desc;Following the Leeuwin War of Independence and the Great Trek away from the Cape, our people have established a home in the north among our brethren the Khoi and the San. Yet, there are those who dared to venture westwards towards the great Kalahari and beyond. Some of the greatest human tragedies of the Great Trek happened out west. The communities established there were so small and isolated that they were not included into when the Republic of Vryland. But now, with the republic consolidated, we can spare the resources to re-establish contact with the communities out west and extend our authority to Karasburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

build_titanic_desc;A few financiers approached the government with the proposal to build one of the biggest ships ever built, dubbing it the Olympic. This Titanic-class ship will be 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m). Its total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, will be 104 feet (32 m). It will measure 46,328 gross register tons and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), weighting 52,310 tons. It will be able to take up to 3,327 people and for its maiden voyage it will have no less than the task of crossing the ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC81002213;At 12:23 p.m. an iceberg was spotted immediately ahead of the Olympic and the bridge was alerted. The First Officer ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be put in reverse, but it was too late: the starboard side struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Olympic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board. More than 1600 people died, the biggest toll in history. The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
