#####lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century that had been utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership. As such, Liberalism has never been seen as important as it was in OTL and unless another revolution were to occur it may never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#####500000.T;Venice wants to buy Durrës;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#####500000.D;The city of Durrës has a history of Venetian control. Interspersed with Serbian, Epirote, Anjou and Albanian control, Venice controled the city. Gained after the Fourth Crusade, but lost soon after. In 1392 the city was recaptured and only being lost in 1501 when the expanding Ottomans conquered the city. With the Ottomans gone, Venice is now looking to regain the city. Whilst we do need the money, it is clear that the loss of our major port would mean the influence of Venice upon our country would become even more massive. Were we to accept, soon, we will loose our independence all together.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANI1.T;Leif Erikson's day;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ANI1.D;900 years ago Vinland was discovered and named by Leif Erikson, son of the settler of Greenland, Erik the Red, after he had seen wild grapes on the shore he landed. While much of his life is unknown apart from some unreliable sagas, and the Vinlanders of old gone, the figure of Leif has been hailed as a national hero since the times of the first settlers. With no precise day for the discovery except that it was fall, the date of Leif's Day was settled by the Vinlandic Parliament to be celebrated on the day before the anniversary of the independence of Vinland on the 17th September. All years the 17th and 18th September are days of celebrations and pride for all people of Vinland. But to mark the canonial date, a replica of a Viking ship has sailed from Iceland to Erikshavn where his arrival was met with an immense and joyous crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC1.T;The Inca claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.D;Quiso Yupanqui was destined to rule the Inca empire as the first born of Huascar III. However his cowardice in the battle of Lima saw him discredited at court, many blaming him for the defeat. He was thus exiled and his uncle Huayna Capac IV was crowned in his stead. For 11 years we have hosted him in Camelot, granting him a small allowance but recently he has grown restless about taking back the throne of the Inca. Reports talk about unrest from the chieftains following the reforms of the Imperial court, and the ilness of the usurper. Quiso has demanded we help him arm his supporters so he could take back what is ours, and ensuring a more friendly, if not open to new ideas neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.A;Arm the partisans of the true Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.B;Place him under guard, we must not trouble the peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC2.T;The coup of Quiso Yupanqui!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC2.D;After years of exile in Beornia, the coward son of Huascar III who commanded the right wing of the Incan army in the battle of Lima and who fled following the charge of the Herrera cavalry has come back to the capital with Beornian guns. Striking by surprise he hopes to take back the throne with the support of many conservative nobles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC2.A;The coup succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC2.B;Quiso Yupanqui and his partisans are stopped and killed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.T;The coronation of Quiso Qapac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.D;The coup has succeeded. Quiso himself slaughtered the usurper and his son despite the formidable defense of the Chinu guard and its commander, the Ronin Oishi Chikara. All administrators were interrogated, with the Qingqiuan Yiang Jujiu minister and first preceptor of the Prince executed for betraying the Empire in favour of the foreigners. The country soon rallied around his true ruler who has promised to uphold the natural balance of the Andine society, reverting several modernization reforms of his predecessors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.A;Long live Quiso Qapac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.T;The Great Andine Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.D;The Inca empire in the Andes is suffering from a great famine following an outbreak of potato blight. Potatoes have suffered in the past from diseases, but never on such a scale and the inefficient and closed governement of Quiso Capac has only worsened the situation. All around the empire the peasants turn to the God of the Sun to relieve them of their pains but so far no sign of amelioration has been seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.A;Why is this happening to us ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC5.T;Famine spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC5.D;The potato blight has spread to another part of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC5.A;Inti preserves us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC6.T;Uraycusta Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC6.D;As the famine spreads to Antisuyu the port of Uraycusta, the "gate of the Empire" has seen the local Aimara inhabitants riot against the foreigners accused of harboring grain to make a profit. The Qingqiuans, the more numerous were the most hit with the Chinese quarter reduced to ashes with hundreds of its inhabitants. Japanese and Anglois traders were also targeted in the attack, the crowd nearly attacking the diplomatic quarter before the intervention of the local police and foreign guards opened fire on the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC6.A;Will the disasters never end ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.T;Opportunities in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.D;The disastrous administration of Quiso Qapac has led to a grave famine in the Andes. The empire of the Inca is weakened as bodies pile throughout the Andine villages and their soldiers are weakened by their hunger. Back in the XVIIth century the adventurer Edward Pitt had tried to conquer a port in the Pacific only to be met by death but now we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.A;Beornia will seize the opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.B;We can't use their distress to gain new lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC8.T;Beornian demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC8.D;An envoy from Camelot has traveled to the Imperial capital to deliver a simple message : cede the southern provinces to the Beornians or they will be taken by force. The famine and unstability have weakened Tawantinusuy and it might be better if we caved in rather than try to delay the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC10.T;Colonization of the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC10.D;The conquest of New-Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that they had 'saved' the Aimara inhabitants of the Southern Andes from the famine. New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions as they hosted several foreign communities, and shipments of food flooded the port. However the campaigns outside never saw much of it as Beornian bureaucrats took lands by force from the inhabitants. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accaparate land for future colonization with countless tribes pushed to the North. When the Beornians did not act, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions as they hosted several foreign communities, and shipments of food flooded the port. However the campaigns outside never saw much of it as Beornian bureaucrats took lands by force from the inhabitants. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army had used the war to destroy villages and accaparate land for future colonization. Countless tribes were pushed to the North while entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC12.A;Beornia has nothing to excuse for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.T;The first Imperial assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.D;One of the reforms pushed by Pachacuti II was the establishment of an Assembly to represent the people of the Empire in governance. It first convened in $YEAR$, with a Lower Chamber elected by the various Ayllus of the Empire and a Senate appointed by the Emperor. The campaigns voted by villages with no individual votes cast, while in the Imperial cities only those who payed the 'poll tax' could vote. The first Inca constitution while deeply influenced by the European and Japanese models, retained several of the particularities of the Empire and established the so-called era of the 'advised Sapa Incas'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.A;The voice of the people is the will of the Inka!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.T;The gate of the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.D;Following the loss of the Inka homeland to the Spanish, the Empire strenghtened its hold on the South. In the southern valley of the new Antisuyu the bay of Uraycusta was first developed by Dongese who had acquired trading privileges following the establishment of the Chinu guard. Following the crossing of Land's End and the treaty of Bordeaux that saw the Anglois gain access to Potosi silver, Uraycusta grew even further. Eventually by the XVIIIth century and the arrival of the Japanese traders in the region, it had been nicknamed the 'Gate of the Inca' by outsiders as this was the only port accessible to foreigners. The reforms of Pachacuti targeted the city the city plan was reorganized and the city was given self governance like the Imperial capital, free from the Southern Apu (governor) as to encourage foreign investments and settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.A;Let the world come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.T;Rice farming in Antisuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.D;Rice was brought to the knowledge of the Inca following the arrival of Dongese merchants and adventurers in the late XIVth century but cultivation was sporadic as few Ayllus and administrators wanted to cultivate this new plant. But in Antisuyu the climate has revealed itself as a good match for the plant and the Asiatic and Qingqiuan presence in the city meant that the cereal was in demand. In the 1840's Pachacuti II, who was a well known consumer of rice, developed great infrastructure projects to enlarge the production of rice in the South. This effort led to an increase of food that allowed the Empire to avoid disaster during the Potato blight of the late 1840's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.A;Rice for the people (and the Inka)!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.D;The only diplomatic tool that the Empire had following the conquest of Cuzco was the great silver mines of the Andes and especially Potosi. While payments to the Spanish were stopped as soon as the Colombian wars began, the Anglois fleet still continued to come every 4 years to take its due. Pachacuti II arranged following his coronation for a diplomat to be sent to Paris to end the treaty to show its regained independence. The Anglois accepted as their reliance on silver had been reduced thanks to Atlantian and Qingqiuan gold flooding the markets with only the payment for $YEAR$ to be done. Now the Silver fleet has left the port of Uraycusta for the last time, with a day of celebrations in the empire for the end of European colonialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.A;Tawantinsuyu will not be exploited anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.D;The Dual-Monarchy had gained access to the Potosi silver in the XVIIth century, securing payments of silver in exchange for guarantees of the Inca Empire continued independence. As silver became less of a necessity thanks to the various Gold rushes, the interest of the Silver fleets declined for Anglois elites. Following the accession of the new Incan emperor Pachacuti II, diplomats agreed to end the old treaty of Bordeaux in exchange for a last shipment and preferential relations with the new 'civilized state';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.A;It was good while it lasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.T;The Great Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.D;Before the arrival of the Conquistadors the Incan economy was not based on individual property and markets, but on the basis of reciprocity between individuals, but also inside the Empire as a whole. The corvée, or mit'ma, was in theory based on the fact that in bad times the emperor would help the communities who worked for him. This system was brutally changed by the Conquest and the spread of European thoughts as the chieftains acquired more lands from the community for themselves. Pachacuti invested several administrators to the creation of a modern cadaster and the end of nobility hegemony on land possession. The mit'ma was also formally abolished. The Ayllus were left with a choice : the lands were divided between the various families of the villages or instituted as common land possessed by the entire village. A mixed system of landowning prevailed after the reforms, granting far more power to the peasant communities than before and ensuring a greater food production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.A;Lands owned by communes, what a strange idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.T;Feeding the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.D;The various reforms of Pachacuti and the adoption of foreign and modern agricultural techniques allowed the Empire to grow far more food than before, accompanying the growth of population. The Empire while not controlling the food market as before still exerted great influence over the merchants, instituting maximum prices during times of hunger and ensuring redistribution of food for isolated communities in periods of drought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.A;Our people is fed and growing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.T;Ending the colonial system;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.D;The reconquest of old imperial lands up to Quito proved to be a major problem for the Empire of the Sun. The economy was controlled by the Granadan and catholic Quechua elites who abused the rural communities to gain more wealth. In the same time the Catholic faith proved to be hard to manage as bishops rallied the masses against the 'Heathen invaders' adoring idols and devils. To counterract both of these problems, the land reform that had been instituted in the Southern Andes was extended to Peru, with the resisting landowners being put to trial or even murdered in riots where the injustice was the worst. Meanwhile the Catholic masses grew less poor thanks to the Inka, securing the loyalty of the rural communities. The land reform disrupted the economy of the Central Andes for nearly two decades as production had to be reorganized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.A;Colonization has ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.T;Renew the Chinu alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.D;The relations between the Qingqiuese and the Empire of the Sun go back to the XVth century when a Dongese ship landed near Quito, bringing the lost Chinese colonists in contact with their first non-hostile state after the disaster of Acapulco. Soon after disgruntled mercenaries from Dong Guo arrived to settle in the empire bringing variolation, gunpowder and mettalurgy to the Empire and forming the 'Chinu Guard', critical to the continued independence of the Inca Empire. After his accession to the throne Pachacuti II sent several ambassies to San Bao to rekindle their long friendship and secure a renewed alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.A;The Alliance must be reforged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.B;We don't need the Qingqiuese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.T;Embassy from the Empire of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.D;The Inca empire was the first non-hostile state the Chinese colonists encountered in the New-World, with Dongese ships avoiding the coast of Mexico following the slaughter of several crewmen in the bay of Acapulco. The Inca Empire brought food and ressources to the lost colonists, and many settled there, with also plenty of sailors marrying with Quechua women during their trips. The new era of Pacific navigation in the XVIIth century allowed the Qingqiuese to transport the Inca silver to China, greatly securing their trade adventures and ensuring the development of Qingqiu as it exists today. The reasons for allying the Inca are numerous and their ambassadors are ready to sign it as soon as we want it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.A;Long live the Pacific alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.B;We don't need them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
humala_mission_title;Humala Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
humala_mission_desc;The Humala Mission or Humala Embassy was an Inca diplomatic journey to Japan, initiated in $YEAR$ by the Imperial court. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Inca and the establishment of lasting relations between the two Empires of the Sun. It was first proposed by the influential head of the Chinu Guard Oishi . The purposes of the mission were twofold: To negotiate commercial treaties to increase trade in the Pacific and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from Japan who was considered as a model of successful and independent modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC23.T;The Humala mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC23.D;In $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ hosted the Humala mission, an embassy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that aimed to negotiate new trade treaties and gather knowledge to assist them in their modernization. The chief of the embassy, Huascar Humala received an imperial audience and attracted great attention during his stay. While not the first Quechua to set foot in the Home Islands, nor the first embassy sent by the Empire of the Sun to the Empire of the Rising Sun, it sponsored growing ties between the two powers and became a symbol of their modernity for the Japanese elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC23.A;Two empires closer under the Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC24.T;Creation of the Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.D;By $YEAR$, the Inca state had transitioned into a dominated monetized economy. The economy minister implemented the creation of a paper-money backed by the huge silver and gold reserves gathered over the centuries. The money soon proved to be resilient and strong as the local population adopted it and international merchants used it for their Amerigan endeavours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.A;Let the money flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.T;Religion in the new Inca state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.D;The cult of Inti, the sun god, has been the basis of the Inca religion since the foundation of the Empire. The emperors claim descent from Inti, with an old legacy of inbreeding to keep the blood of the god pure. Each ayllu worships huacas, mummified ancestors kept in the Imperial capital, and several other deities of the Andine pantheon. The relocation of the Empire to the South didn't change much as Christianity never truly took because of the tales of Spanish brutalities against the colonized populations of the western provinces. Pachacuti II guaranteed freedom of religion in the hopes of securing the loyalty of the Quechua in Granada and to please the European powers. This created some backlash from some of the religious elite but Pachacuti left all religious decisions to the Willaq Umu, the High Priest of Inti who spent the following years consolidate the Imperial religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.A;Is this still the empire of Inti ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.T;The Inti state religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.D;While the Sapa Inka officially left all religious affairs to the priests of Inti, only performating the rituals required by the tradition following the decision of Pachacuti II, this only strenghtened the cult in the long term. The various Willaq Umu, chosen by the Sapa Inka and reserved by tradition to members of the Imperial family, formalized the relationship between the gods and the Sapa Inka who became even more in the Imperial ideology a divine being who was separate from the rest of his subjects. The various cults of the Andes were left untouched by these changes, as the official religion only took care of the Imperial cults and especially the shrines of Inti. The Inti faith was reenforced by this new movement as the people took part in Inti ceremonies to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire while honoring their huacas and offering sacrifices to their local divinities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.A;The Inca preserves balance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC27.T;The Inti Raymi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC27.D;The first task the Imperial officers prepared for after the reconquest of Cuzco was the preparations for the Festival of the Sun, the greatest ceremony of the Empire performed by the Sapa Inca himself on the winter solstice. Crowds gathered in the Imperial capital to celebrate the renewed festival since the Conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC27.A;On the 24th June $YEAR$, the empire was truly reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.T;The Koricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.D;Back in the days of the old empire, the Willaq Umu performed their rituals in the golden temple, close to the Imperial palaces and in the true centre of the Empire. The Spanish demolished the temple, only leaving the foundations to build a church on it. While freedom of religion had been proclaimed and the Catholic cult was not persecuted anymore, the Imperial governement demolished the Church of Santo Francesco and planned a new Koricancha to be built. This act while heavily justified to the eyes of the Inti followers was met with rage by the Catholic faithful. The temple took nearly 15 years to be rebuilt, shining with gold and silver and being acclaimed as the herald of the new imperial architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.A;Catholics will accept it or face our wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC29.T;The Cuzco university;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC29.D;The return of the Imperial court to Cuzco saw numerous great works to embellish and make the old city a worthy capital for the Empire of the Sun. Among these works was the University of Cuzco, which soon became the centre of knowledge for the Empire as the first centre of higher learning of the empire. Several others spawned over the years but none as prestigious as the first Inca university.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC29.A;Independence through knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC30.T;The Mountains of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC30.D;For decades the conquest of New-Mercia had been heralded as a great humanitarian project that had allowed civilization to flourish into the uncivilized Andes. But a recent report from a Burgundian missionary, Jean Casemer, who has spent 5 years in Native communities from the Andes has torn this facade apart. Collecting the tales of the great famine and the atrocities done by the Beornian army, he has personally scouted several abandoned villages 'meeting only death' for miles. His report was a blow to Beornian prestige although it did not amount to much as the Beornians never apologized or changed their stance about their Western provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC30.A;So much for the humanitarian facada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annex_easter_island_title;The legacy of Nina-Chumbi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annex_easter_island_desc;Tales from the old empire tell how Tupac Yupanqui sailed to spread the Empire of the Sun across the sea, finding the islands of Nina-chumbi and Hahua-chumbi. As our mastery of the sea progresses, our contacts with the isolated island of Rapa Nui have grown, and many think that they are truly the islands of the myths. Even if that isn't true, the possession of this island would strenghten our mastery of the South-Eastern Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC61.D;The Mapudungun people have always fiercely resisted centralization, only coming together in timesof war to protect themselves from the invaders. As years go by, we have seen times changing. When we could resist the ‘Inka’, be they Quechua or Beornian, seems like a long time ago. The tribes accepted peace, even if it meant to see our enemies grow stronger. But now has come a formidable man, Lars Heyerdhal, a great explorer and commander who has heard of our plights and propose to wage war to recover our lost lands. A council of the main tribes of our country has declared him ‘toqi’, our leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC61.A;Long hail our savior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.T;Reports from the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.D;Troubled reports come from the Mapuche tribes. A man called Lars Heyerdhal coming from Scandinavia has seemingly been able to rally the tribes against our rule. Our contacts in the European embassies know nothing of this man who apparently was just a disillusioned immigrant in Camelot a few months ago. The Scandinavian attaché in Uraycusta pledges that he will get an official statement from his country, but he seems as lost as us on the situation. Our Foreign department is not so pleased by Scandinavian intervention. From their base of Tapt O, they have over the years sent several expeditions in the Southern Cone, and while there has been no official attempt to settle the place, the revolt of the Mapuche could very well be a pretext for Copenhagen to intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.A;What does this settler intends to do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.T;The Kingdom of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.D;Strange news come from Southern Ameriga. In two days we have received a demand from clarification from our representative in the Incan Empire and a letter of friendship from the so-called ‘King of Araucania and Patagonia’, Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal. Reports seem to indicate that Lars Heyerdhal was months ago just a worthless subject of the Crown, but he has apparently taken over the Mapuche tribes as their king and want to expel the Incas from their lands. While he seems like a madman, he could serve our interests. Numerous tribes inhabit the Southern Cone : let them unite under a King of our obedience while we settle the Magellan strait. Or we could let the Southerners deal with this delusional King. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.A;Recognize his kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.B;Assure the Incas we have nothing to do with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.T;Scandinavian recognition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.D;The letter from the King Karl-Lars has been received warmly by the Foreign department of Copenhagen who has recognized our state as sovereign and rightful. This has been a great honor for the King, who still apparently doesn’t know that a toqi is not the same thing as a King, but translation problems will have to wait for the end of the Inka claims on their territories. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.A;For the Mapuche!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.T;Scandinavian intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.D;What we thought was just a farce has now become a matter of state. The so-called kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia, instituted by the mad Lars Heyerdhal, has been recognized by the Scandinavians who now ask us to retire our troops from the Araucanian territory.

We could easily convince him to give his royal rights to the King, settle him in a Norwegian fjord and move to annex the Mapuche into our colonial empire. After all, we control their military with their officers trained by our men and supplying them with weapons and ammunition.

Resistance was easily crushed : Scandinavians had explored the territory for years, and knew whose elders could help them in controlling the territory.

NAV1.T;Basque Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him. What will possibly happen??;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV2.D;The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his dreams of independence. He reasoned that Aragon is decaying and through our historic and cultural ties with the Pamplonan Crown, it is our duty to intervene on his behalf. Yet, our advisors are alarmed: Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead and might retaliate. Nonetheless, Henry IV awaits an answer. Our strength might be enough to scare off Barcelona, but they nonetheless might escalate it into a war. If we don't help Henry IV, Spain might use this chance alone to finally free the Basque from the Aragonese yoke. But we could use this opportunity to gain a client state in Euskadia, although this would anger our long-time friend and ally Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV9.D;Crowds were filling the streets of Navarra as a reaction to the broken promise of independence of the Basque people. At first, the police and the military tried to stop them from reaching the royal residence of Henry IV, but after some shots have been fired whose perpetrators lost to the faceless mass, a mass hysteria ensued. They stormed the Supreme Court in Bilbao, they stormed the forts in the Pyrenees and at our borders to our Iberian brethren and they stormed the royal palace of Pamplona. The king, his wife and his children and some other notable landed nobles are nowehere to be seen, although reports are emerging that they've found refuge in Aragon and Spain.

Be assured that your choice was the wrong one, but the king is wishing you good luck for your new journey in this brave, new world." Aragon formally accepted our plea, meaning that we have narrowly avoided a war for our cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV21.T;Death of Henry IV of Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;; #Should now only happen if NAV9 isn't triggered
NAV21.D;The Bourbon dynasty has seen fewer and fewer male members born these last years. The last true Bourbon, descendant of Hugh Capet has died in Pampeluna yesterday. He leaves two possible heirs : his sister, the countess of St-Sebastian married into the Aragonese royal family, and the infante of Bilbao, his illegimate daughter married to the Dauphin of England-France.

SCA_FINPuppetAnnex_desc;Ever since the Finnish National Diet proclaimed the birth of the Kingdom of Finland, the Finns have enjoyed extensive autonomy within Scandinavia.

reintergrate_finnish_desc;Finnish nationalism was a grim page in the history of Scandinavia. To placate Österland once and for all we have been forced to create ten governatorates under Copenhagen's strict control, stripping the Finns of all political autonomy. Only a handpicked minority of loyal Scandinavian nationals retained its official citizenship, replacing Finnish and Karelians in all levels of the local administration. A lot has changed and while Finland may now seem at peace, new ideologies and agitations stir the crestfallen and disaffected inhabitants of the region. To avoid a new Finnish War of Independence we must relinquish our authoritarian rule over Finland and allow natives to have a say over local and national matters by granting them full citizenship. The Scandinavian family must reconcile with its quarrelsome Prodigal Son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

We must replace foreign names with the original ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN1.T;The Finnish National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN1.D;The Finnish National Awakening is a long period of political and cultural ferment in Finland and Karelia roughly starting with the publication in 1835 of the Kalevala, a compendium of Finnic oral poetry and legends. Finnic nationalism has spread among the finnish-speaking educated middle class, starting from the foundation in 1838 of the Sampo Society in Borgå as a direct response to the Three Crowns Act. Inner Finland and Karelia have lagged behind due to their rural conformation, but the growing discontent with Scandinavian rule and fears of Russian expansionism have given rise to a distinct Karelian national sentiment of lower class origin. Despite their differences, Finnish and Karelian nationalism share the same ambitions of Finnic unity -for now- and self-rule, unlike the heavily Scandinavianized Ostrobothnian and Helsingforsian nobility, who are loyal to the idea of integral union with the mainland, despite their patronage of Finnish culture. The Finns will soon challenge Copenhagen's indifference and ask to reconsider the status of Finland within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191916.A;Exploiting their weaknesses and divisions will guarantee the unity of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN2.T;The Finns request a National Diet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN2.D;Three weeks ago in Helsingfors, a public debate organized by the nationalist Sampo Society about the proposal to make Finnish a co-official language of Österland has derailed into a full fledged popular consultation regarding Scandinavian rule in the region. Despite the swift dissolution of the assembly by the police, a group of seven intellectuals has written a four page manifesto based on the proposals and the complaints gathered during the consultation. The document has been summarized in a public letter addressed to our sovereign asking to convene a National Finnish Diet to redefine Finland's status within the realm. The letter has been signed by many famous and influential intellectuals and politicians, like Count Jakob Stiernhielm, with the hope of raising awareness among Scandinavian mainlanders about Finland's problems. The Finnic nationalist front is still developing and lacks cohesion, but it's not at all certain that we could get rid of them in one go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.A;Stop pestering us with such grievances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.B;They are still part of the Kingdom of Sweden, lest we forget. The Riksdag will decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.C;Summon the National Diet in Helsingfors, let them argue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.T;The National Diet of Helsingfors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.D;170 delegates from all lands belonging to the the Gulf of Bothnia have been convened in the New City Hall of Helsingfors to define Finland's new constitutional order. Thus far, nationalist delegates from Karelia and Southern Finland have formed a "Autonomist" party with the support of some Ostrobothnians deputies who had signed the Petition for a National Diet. All other Ostrobothnians are staunchly opposing every attempt to remove Copenhagen's political control over the activities of the future Senate. As deputies frequently change their official stance from autonomist to conservative and viceversa there's no way to predict who will gain the upper hand. However, the next daily session will be open by our Prime Minister, who will subtly warn Karelian delegates that those who claim to be their ally against the Scandinavian "tyrant" may prove to be far harsher masters. If this manages to put a flea in their ears we might create a rift between the two nationalities. We await future developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191918.A;It will be the pivotal moment of this Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.D;Despite the Prime Minister's barefaced attempt to break the Autonomist front, Finnish and Karelian deputies preserved their political unity for several days, until the reckless suggestion of making Finnish the sole official language of the new nation shifted a sizeable group of moderate Scandinavian-speaking and Karelian deputies towards anti-independence positions. The breakaway group allowed the Ostrobothnian faction to win by a narrow margin a series of crucial votes. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland has been solemnly sent to our monarch by the Diet's President. The Finns will benefit from a less centralised local administration and some economical privileges, but the new Senate will have no effective scrutiny ability over the Copenhagen appointed plenipotentiary, Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson. As the title "Grand-Duchy" suggests, there's no equal political status with the other Nordic kingdoms and foreign affairs are entirely under Scandinavian control. This will not quell the Finns' rumbling for long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191919.A;I dare them to come back asking for more after this unprecedented concession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.D;The Prime Minister's effrontery has had the opposite effect than that expected, strengthening nationalist positions and unity, thus exacerbating the clash between Scandinavian-speaking Ostrobothnians and radicalised independentists. After a fight between two deputies had interrupted a session of the Diet, the Ostrobothnian delegation decide to abandon the Chamber and return home, declaring that they will have nothing more to do with the Finns. The Rump Diet has nonetheless written a surprisingly moderate Constitution for the Kingdom of Finland. Copenhagen will retain substantial control over the Senate and the new National Diet, but the Finnish Army will be completely independent from Scandinavia's. The Helsingforsian nobility mourns the birth of a nation that publicly denounced them as traitors and awaits the time it will return under direct mainlander protection as Ostrobothnia. The Finns got what they wanted, but they won't be able to escape Scandinavian control any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191920.A;With an absolute king this would never have happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.T;The Karelian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.D;After a brilliant speech by our Prime Minister, fight has erupted between Finnish and Karelian nationalists. Divisive questions like the recognition of Karelian language have been brought to the surface, putting at risk the solidarity between Finnic nationalities. Recent votes have shown a steady growth of the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction, but victory can not be claimed yet. The most prominent Finnish delegates are trying to mend this fracture in time for the crucial decisions on the new Senate's powers by promising autonomy and other substantial concessions. In the last few days, however, a pamphlet asking for a separate Karelian Diet has spread like wildfire in Helsingfors. Finnish and Karelian delegates call it a petty provocation, but they can't deny it well represents the feelings of some representatives of the Eastern Frontier. We can only wait until the proceedings of the Diet reach a conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191921.A;They want another Diet?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.T;The Autonomists reconcile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.D;Despite the staunch opposition of Copenhagen's most loyal supporters, the new autonomist Constitution of the Kingdom of Finland has been approved by a wide margin. After the emergence of separatist positions within the Karelian delegation many thought that the fractured Diet would be locked in a stalemate. Instead, the prompt reply of some Finnish nationalists leaders regrouped the Autonomist faction and marginalized the supporters of the "Karelian Diet Petition". The momentum gained by this display of internal cohesion permitted the approval of some radical autonomist proposals, often deleterious for the privileges of Scandinavian-speaking citizens. Copenhagen's control over the Senate and the new National Diet will be minimal. Scandinavia loses a precious piece of its Baltic dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191922.A;This is the end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.T;The Karelian March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.D;The intrinsic contradictions of the Finnic nationalist movement have been exposed, leading to the dissolution of the Autonomist party. Finnish deputies have regrouped and radicalised triggering a similar reaction in the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction. As the polarized Diet approached a stalemate, the authors of the Karelian Diet Petition made themselves public and called for a sabotage of the anti-Karelian Helsingfors Diet. As eastern deputies returned to their constituencies, the Finnish National Diet was dissolved, resulting in bare minimum changes to the status quo. However, as proposed by General Johan Von Ascheberg, Finnish nationalism can be defeated once an for all only if the South and the East stay divided. He therefore proposes the creation of a militarized "Karelian March" to defend our Eastern Frontier and quell all future separatist feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191923.A;A brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.D;Divergences between Finnish and Karelians nationalists have benefited the Ostrobothnian-led conservative party, leading to a rejection of many autonomist proposals. When came the pyrrhic reconciliation of the two nationalities, the most uncompromising Karelian deputies had already teamed up with the moderates, giving them a decisive majority in the Diet. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland was solemnly sent to the monarch by the Diet's President. The Copenhagen-appointed Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson has almost complete control over the legislative process, with the ability to dissolve the new National Diet and nominate ministers at will. His Minister of Defence, General Johan Von Ascheberg, has transferred the control of most of the Eastern Frontier to the Scandinavian army, citing the strategic importance of the region. The Karelians, who hoped to gain a favourable arrangement at the expense of their southern cousins, are now blocked in a situation far worse than the one they started with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191924.A;This solution does not seem destined to last long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.T;The Riksdag of the Estates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.D;After decades of inactivity, the Riksdag of the Estates of Sweden has been convened in the House of Nobility of Stockholm to determine the new status of Österland within the Scandinavian realm. Copenhagen's Landsting has contested the legitimacy of such assembly, whose powers had been delegated de facto to the new unified chamber of the Empire, but an intervention of the Prime Minister made clear that the convocation of a kingdom's estates currently is an inappellable personal prerogative of the Monarch. As deputies from Denmark and Norway had forewarned, the opening of the Riksdag rekindled Stockholm's desire for autonomy and decentralization, transforming the Finnish Question in a challenge to Copenhagen's authority. The constitutional foundations of our nation will undergo drastic changes regardless of the decisions made by the estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191925.A;Scandinavia will forever stand united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.D;A speech by our monarch has officially closed the Riksdag of the Estates, putting an end to the farce of the Swedish barons. The Stockholm assembly was forced to realize its complete lack of effective political powers and the results of its workings can be considered ceremonial, at best. The Grand Duchy of Finland has been carved out of Sweden's territory and as the name suggests its status is not equal compared to the three constituent kingdoms of the Empire. The Copehagen Landsting has had its revenge, but the Riksdag's damage is done and now the Prime Minister has to appoint a Governor-General to formally deal with the powerless National Diet of Finland. The Finns have returned east feeling teased and mortified by the paternalism of the Swedes and they will surely come back asking for more autonomy. Copenhagen must now demonstrate the full capabilities of the central government, maybe by giving exceptional powers to the Governor-General in Helsingfors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191926.A;Carl Anders Torstensson will be our trusted man in Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.T;The Instrument of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.D;Long negotiations with the representatives of the Finnish Estates have lead to the adoption of a new Instrument of Government for the Kingdom of Sweden, officially changing its name to the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Finland. Stockholm celebrated what was widely regarded as the creation of a Swedish Empire within Scandinavia, but the first Finnish-speaking delegates at the Landsting in Copenhagen were vocal in denouncing the paternalism of the Swedes and the absence of true political reform. They officially appealed to the Chamber representing the Empire as a whole asking to grant to all Finns effective citizenship rights and protection, within and outside the borders of the Kingdom. This is the perfect opportunity to reaffirm Copenhagen's authority: we must seize the Finnic lands just across our border and prove once more that our country is strong and united. But if we pursue in our inaction, it won't be just the Eastern Frontier that will search for alternative solutions to our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191927.A;We must safeguard Finland and Karelia from the Eastern menace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.T;The Helsingfors Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.D;As foretold by months of growing unrest, fighting has erupted in the streets of Helsingfors after a peaceful demonstration of the Sampo Society was dispersed by the police. The popular neighbourhoods are completely out of control and the chief of the city police has been shot while supervising an assault to a barricade. The representative of the Scandinavian government has left the city in secret and is now trying to organize a retaliation from the Sveaborg Fortress, in the nearby archipelago. As the news reached the rest of the country, other Finnish cities have followed Helsingfors' fate and some border garrisons manned by Finnish and Karelian recruits have mutinied. Copenhagen promised equity and protection to its Finnic subjects, but its despotic rule over the region and the complete indifference for the cries of help coming from across the border have depleted the Finnish patience and trust. Nationalism reaches its natural outcome: a Finnish War of Independence is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191928.A;We will strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.T;The Pacification of the Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.D;With the expulsion of the Slavic invaders, Karelia is united once and for all under the aegis of Scandinavia. Copenhagen has fulfilled its promise to the Finnic nation and now the Landsting can rightfully claim to be the only representative body of all the Nordic peoples. Finnish nationalism will not bother Scandinavia for a long long time, but it will not disappear completely. The hard-earned harmony must be secured from the ambitions of its enemies in the East and in the South, by all means necessary. As our Empire is more united now than it has ever been, we must use this new-found strength to impose our peace on the entire Baltic basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191929.A;A tough chapter ends and a glorious one begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.T;The Great Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.D;After their underwhelming first attempt, the Sampo Society has organized an unprecedented collection of signatures throughout Finland and Karelia with the volunteer help of university students. The meticulous organization of the campaign has resulted in the collection in less than two weeks of over three hundred thousand nominatives, which have been delivered to the Royal Palace in Copenhagen by a delegation of the Society, lead by Count Jakob Stiernhielm and the self-exiled Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise. The recent years of mismanagement of the region have compacted the nationalist front, which has put aside regionalist interferences in favour of pan-Finnic unity, so it might not be possible to hush again separatist sentiments. Were the petition be rejected, the agitators will have their perfect chance to proclaim that Copenhagen does not care for its subjects across the Gulf of Bothnia and this may lead to open rebellion. It seems like we have no choice but to assent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.A;This petition is wasted paper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.B;Maybe this way we can avoid a useless war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.T;The National Diet of Åbo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.D;The Estates of Finland have convened in the main building of the former Royal Academy of Åbo, known as Turku in Finnish, to define once and for all Finland's status within the Scandinavian Realm. The hemicycle is almost perfectly split in half between the self styled "Fennoscandian Party", favourable to the draft articles proposed by the Copenhagen Landsting, and the autonomist deputies, who have adopted the appellation of "Kalevalists", satirically used by a Stockholmer newspaper. The president of the National Diet, Duke Erik Mannerheim, has painstakingly maintained the balance between the two groups, but as the debate advances, Fennoscandians and Kalevalists espouse increasingly divergent and irreconcilable stances. The Finns face the final choice between full citizenship and protection within Scandinavia, as promised by Copenhagen, or the gamble of self-determination. The Nordic Union is hung by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191931.A;We shall wait for the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.T;The National Pledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.D;Thanks to the acclaimed diplomatic skills of Duke Erik Mannerheim, the moderate Kelavalist deputies have found a reasonable agreement with the Fennoscandian Party. The new constitution includes many of the draft articles proposed by Copenhagen and some important additions put forward by the nationalists. The newborn Kingdom of Finland will be a constituent country of the Scandinavian Empire and just like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it will formally retain its national assembly (the Eduskunta) while delegating most of the legislative power to the Empire's Landsting in the capitol. After the solemn National Pledge to the Monarch in the Åbo Cathedral, Count Jakob Stiernhielm delivered a speech asking for the extension of full citizenship rights and protection to the Karelian brethren living across the border, where Slavic expansionism threatens their very existence. By unifying Karelia, Copenhagen may finally prove their good faith and curb Finnish nationalism once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191932.A;Itään!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.D;Despite the best efforts of the deputies loyal to the Empire, a new constitution has been drafted by the Kalevalists with the support of some Fennoscandian defectors. A bold harangue by deputy Charles-Joseph de Frise against the draft articles proposed by the Landsting turned the tide of the National Diet in favour of the nationalists, facilitating the following crucial Kelavalist victories. The new National Assembly (the Eduskunta) and Senate will de facto be completely free from Copenhagen's interference and even if the Scandinavian Monarch will still rule over the newborn Kingdom of Finland, the Governor-General will be merely ceremonial figure. In the mainland, disappointment is widespread among the entire population and the general opinion is that the government has officially abandoned the historical ambition of uniting the Baltic under the Scandinavian banner. As Finland secedes without firing a shot, many are becoming critical of the old and weary Kalmar Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191933.A;Is the end of the Scandinavian Empire drawing nearer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.T;The Diet is dissolved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.D;An attempted arson of the building where the National Diet meets has forced the Prime Minister to halt the assembly indefinitely. In the days preceding the attack, the tense relationship between Fennoscandians and Kalevalists had reached a breaking point, forcing the Diet's president to close the session in multiple occasions due to fights between deputies. A Finnish-language radical newspaper (Aamurusko) claims that the arsonist attack has been orchestrated by the Scandinavian government to impede the rejection of Copenhagen's draft articles in the forthcoming session of the Diet and reinstate the status quo by dissolving the assembly. Despite the lack of evidence, many former Finnic deputies have publicly repudiated the Åbo parliament and have started to organize an autonomous Parliament in Borgå. Unrest is quickly growing in the Finnish countryside and some cities like Tavastehus are already in open rebellion. War seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191934.A;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.T;The Pink Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.D;To contain the escalating violence spreading throughout Finland after the attempted arsonist attack at the National Diet, a large group of former deputies and intellectuals have gathered in Tammersfors to complete as fast as possible the drafting of Finland's constitution. The resulting compromise between the Fennoscandians and moderate Kelavalists has been printed on pink-coloured paper and has started to spread throughout the country, gaining mixed reactions. The proposed arrangement will give Finland a great deal of autonomy, nonetheless substantial control over the Parliament and the Senate will be in the hands of the Governor-General and Copenhagen's Landsting. By recognizing the Pink Declaration, most of the Finnic political and cultural elite will reconcile with Scandinavia, but the anger caused by the Åbo Incident will continue to spread albeit at a weaker pace. War has been avoided at a great cost, but it seems like the ghost of violence will not leave Finland for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191935.A;Troubled times lay ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.T;The Eduskunta in Borgå;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.D;Fostered by the Sampo Society and the nationalist gazette Aamurusko, the leading figures of Finland's political and cultural panorama have gathered in the city of Borgå to draft a constitution for the Kingdom of Finland in complete autonomy from the Landsting and the Crown. As the city celebrates the gathering of deputies from all over the country, a growing number of formerly moderate political figures have openly challenged the dogma of a real union with the Empire of the Scandinavia, petitioning for the creation of a Kingdom of Finland with a king other than that of Copenhagen. All orders to halt this insubordination have gone unheeded and following cascading mutinies most of the Imperial Army warehouses have been looted, limiting Scandinavia's effective rule over the region to some major coastal forts like Sveaborg in the Helsingfors bay. The creation of "National Defence Battalions" demonstrates the intentions of the Finnish deputies: only brute force can end this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191936.A;Finland will know the Mainland's wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.T;The Finnish Declaration of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.D;The birth of Kingdom of Finland has been proclaimed from the balcony of the new Senate building in Helsingfors in front of a packed Central Square. The provisional legislative assembly, the Eduskunta, has nominated a plenipotentiary cabinet, the Senate, which will also have the role of a regency council. Independentist zeal spreads throughout the newborn nation and volunteers flock to the recruitment office for the National Defense Batallions. Copenhagen's control over the region has been reduced to a mere formality and a large influx of Scandinavian-speaking refugees has reached the shores of Sweden, fleeing the incoming persecutions of the nationalist government. The imperial cabinet has tried for the last time to reach a peaceful compromise with the Finnish Senate, but a vote of the Eduskunta against the recognition of the Scandinavian Monarch as the head of state has abruptly ended all negotiations. The Finland Uprising has been set in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191937.A;Österland will pay for this treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.T;The King of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.D;Finland has broken the chains of oppression and now needs a King to rally behind. Most of the Scandinavian-speaking deputies of the Eduskunta support the crowning of Count Jakob Stiernhielm, a descendent of an illegitimate son of King Alexander IV. This conciliatory figure will mend the rift between our Scandinavian and Finnish citizens, but Jakob's conservative nature will most likely letdown and alienate the zealous nationalists that are fueling Finland's morale and war effort. To gain foreign help, many have suggested petitioning Prague for a noble to crown in exchange of mutual support against Scandinavia, but the most popular foreign candidate is the Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise, the self-exiled liberal son of Queen Anne of Burgundy who has become a member of the new Senate. He's the nationalists' choice, but will the Burgundians accept the crowning of this rogue family member and the final conclusion of their long worn off alliance with Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.A;Will Anvers recognize Charles Joseph?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.B;Send a messenger to Prague!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.C;Count Jakob Stiernhielm becomes King Jaakko I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.T;A crown from the gutter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.D;Finland has declared independence from Scandinavia and the provisional Regency Council has decided to ask us for a suitable monarch in exchange of a military alliance and substantial economic concessions. This is the perfect occasion to further weaken Scandinavia's grip of the Baltic Sea. Bedrich z Valdstejna, the most prominent member of one the most influential families of the nation, has proven his political skills as governor of Moravia and his family's close links with Bohemian royalty certainly give him the blue blood necessary to bear the crown. Shall the country prepare for yet another war in the North?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.A;We will stand with the Finns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.B;The proposal is rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.T;A King from Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.D;Frederick von Waldstein has landed in Helsinki in great secret to ensure his safe voyage. After a unanimous approval by the Eduskunta, King Fredrik I has been crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral and has confirmed the special powers delegated to the Senate in the previous days. No one dares to interrupt the celebrations, but many in private whisper that the foreign king is more suitable for palace intrigues than for motivating soldiers before a desperate war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191940.A;We'll just have to make do for this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.T;The unexpected king;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.D;Prague has completely ignored the Senate's request for military support in exchange for political and economical influence over Finland. The secret negotiations have been rapidly covered up, but the Eduskunta awaits a new head of state before Scandinavia recovers from the shock of the secession and strikes down hard over the country. Count Jakob Stiernhielm has refused to accept the crown after he had learned of the attempt to contact the Bohemians, whom he had fought against in the past. The Prince of Friesland has disappeared from Helsinki and many suspect that he would not accept the "Second-Hand" crown, angering his nationalist political base. During the last extraordinary session of the Senate, however, the choice fell on the only political figure in the Eduskunta with unanimous respect and admiration from both the conservatives and the radical nationalists: Duke Erik Mannerheim. Despite his lack of dynastic ties with royal families, the love of his people will ennoble him enough to become a rightful king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191941.A;Long live King Erkki I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.T;The Prince of Friesland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.D;Charles-Joseph de Frise, the second son of Queen Anne, has been proposed as the monarch of the newly independent Kingdom of Finland. Charles Joseph has been a frequent embarrassment for the Burgundian royal family due to his unorthodox political ideas, but his voluntary self-exile to the far North had appeased the court of Anvers. Officially recognizing his investiture will give us substantial political and economical benefits in the new realm, but this alliance with the Finns would force us to leave behind our increasingly problematic political alignment with Copenhagen. Disavowing Charles Joseph comes at no cost beyond the potential risk of a regency should Queen Anne depart with no further heirs, but the potential gains deriving from a change of policy towards Scandinavia are conceivably superior to those coming from renewing our weary alliance with the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.A;Let us help our new Finnish friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.B;He has nothing to do with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.T;The King of all Finns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.D;The Prince of Friesland has been enthusiastically acclaimed as the new monarch by the Eduskunta and the Senate. Charles-Joseph de Frise has decided to relinquish his Burgundian name and title, becoming Kaarle I of Jülich-Kleve-Suomi, King of all Finns. This energetic and charismatic figure enjoys the support of most of the common people and radical nationalists, but many conservative and moderate figures do not hide their fears of his authoritarian tendencies. Time will tell if King Kaarle will respect the directions of his former peers in the Senate and the legislative assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191943.A;God save our glorious King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.T;Citizen and Deputy Charles Joseph;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.D;When informed of the Senate's decision to crown Charles-Joseph de Frise as King of Finland , Anvers replied by disavowing him and condemning the Finnish uprising. While many support the coronation of the "Citizen-King" regardless of Burgundy's hostility, a group of radical nationalists have suggested to remove all traces of the Scandinavian monarchic mentality and name Charles Joseph "President for life of Finland". However, many adversaries of the ambitious Prince of Friesland, including moderates and former loyalists, have voiced their opposition to these eccentric and blatantly autocratic denominations, proposing instead the creation of a republican parliamentary regime, whose head of state will be decided every six years by the national assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.A;Long live King Kaarle I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.B;Finland shall be a free, united and democratic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.C;All hail our perpetual President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.T;The Finnish Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.D;After centuries of Scandinavian domination, Finland has declared its independence and is now fighting to repel its former oppressors. Ever since their conversion to Christianity, Finnish and Karelians have lived under the influence of either Novgorod or Stockholm and later Copenhagen, fighting against each other to conquer every possible inch of the "Eastern Frontier" for their overlords. The publishing in 1835 of the Kalevala, an epic poem based on Finnic oral folklore, triggered the Finnish National Awakening, rallying intellectuals, artists and, later, politicians from both sides of the Scandinavian-Novgorodian border under the common goal of uniting the Finnic people and protecting it from assimilation either from the West or the East. The members of this movement initially hoped to achieve their goals by peacefully petitioning Copenhagen to recognize their rights to citizenship and national unity within the Scandinavian realm, but the indifference and the missteps of the central government caused the radicalization of Finnish nationalism, leading to the current violent secession. Will the Empire of the North live through this new challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191945.A;We shall strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.T;The War in Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.D;With the start of the Finnish Rebellion, Scandinavia has been too busy organizing the reconquest of its former Baltic dominion to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. The Veche is now free to reclaim its former political authority by revoking the illegal privileges of Scandinavian bourgeoisies. The election of the Posadnik will no longer be determined by the whims of Copenhagen. We are finally free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191946.A;Wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.T;The Treaty of Uppsala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.D;A peace treaty between Scandinavia and Finland has been signed in the ancient capitol of the Swedish Kingdom, of which the newborn nation will no longer be part. The unforeseen defeat has been a tremendous blow for the Empire of the North, whose hegemony in the Baltic Sea is now a thing of the past. After centuries of relative internal peace, regional separatist movements have started to reclaim autonomy from weak Copenhagen for the constituent kingdoms of the realm, especially Sweden whose territory has been halved. To survive this dire moment, Scandinavia has to prove once more its might and its importance among the European empires, and when this time comes the East will face our vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191947.A;A minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.T;The Last Northern Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.D;As soon as the fighting reached the outskirts of Helsingfors, the provisional government of Finland realized that the war was lost and that the exhausted National Defense Batallions could not withstand the assault of the Scandinavian army. Most of the members of the Eduskunta have either surrendered to the imperial forces or have fled towards Russia or Germany, where the enemies of the Empire have promised to support the future struggles for independence of the Finnic people. The resurgence of Finnic nationalism will probably be slow to arrive as war has ravaged both the countryside and the urban centres, leaving behind a war torn and disfigured country. Österland will be reorganized in ten military governances and the estates expropriated from the supporters of the revolutionary regime will be gifted to loyal Scandinavian-speaking subjects of the Empire. The effects of the Finnish National Awakening will be reversed with a process of pervasive Scandinavization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN34.T;The Pskov Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN34.D;Bourgeoises, merchants and nobles from both the city and the countryside are reunited every three years in the Pskovian Veche to appoint a new Posadnik, who has always been a Scandinavian Noble since the rebirth of the Republic. Copenhagen enforces its will either through direct interference in the election process or thanks to its fifth column: the Finnish boyars, who are disproportionately numerous in the Veche thanks to Byzantine bureaucracy and special constitutional clauses. An angry mob has killed the newly re-appointed Posadnik, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, by setting fire to the wooden stage where he was delivering his inaugural speech. Some members of the Veche have died and peasants are besieging the City Hall, but an extraordinary session has been summoned nonetheless to nominate a new Posadnik. Copenhagen is too distant to intervene quickly and Finnish boyars are in disarray. For the first time since "independence", Pskov will decide its own ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191949.A;The Russian brethren will unite under the Prince of Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191949.B;The Duke of Narva is the perfect compromise figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN35.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN35.D;The Pskovians have rescinded with violent means the privileges of Finnish boyars and in a surprising turn of events the Veche has voted to recognize as sovereign the Prince of Novgorod, rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Uniting the Northern Russians will surely anger Copenhagen, but most of the members of the Novgorodian Veche have already proclaimed their support for this development, regardless of the unavoidable retaliation and the end of Scandinavia's protection against Muscovite expansionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191950.A;Novgorod the Great will return to the Baltic shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.T;Pskov Rejoins Novogrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.D;After the Pskovian peasants killed Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, the Scandinavian-appointed Posadnik of the Republic, a group of Russian boyars took control of the city's Veche and swore fealty to the Prince of Novgorod. Despite the extensive Scandinavian interests in the republic, Pskov is intent on rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Given how the unrest in Finland and the ever-present threat of Bohemia have already stretched our forces thin, it might be wiser to attempt to come to a compromise with the Novgorodians, partitioning the lands of Pskov between each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.A;Offer them the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.B;Never! We will teach these upstarts not to defy Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.T;The Partition of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.D;The Scandinavian reaction to what was effectively a pro-Novgorodian coup has been much milder than anticipated. Copenhagen has offered us a deal in which they agree to recognize our annexation of Pskov as legitimate in exchange for control over Ingria. While a relatively favorable deal, with the bulk of Pskov remaining in our hands, it still fails to resolve the question of our access to the Baltic. There are those in the Veche who loudly proclaim this offer a sign of Scandinavian weakness, and that we should demand the retention of Ingria, even in the event of war. Still others hold that we ought to be satisfied with our laurels, cautioning that Scandinavian protection is the only thing shielding us from aggression by our southern neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.A;Copenhagen shall have Ingria, lest we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.B;We knew the risks. Pskov will be ours, by force of arms if necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.D;The Novgorodians have rejected our generous offer to partition the former Republic of Pskov. Already, Novgorodian armies have begun to mobilize and march towards Finland and our Livonian holdings. For the audacity to reject our treaty the Novgorodians will know the full wrath of Scandinavia as we lay waste to their precious republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191953.A;Spare the rod, spoil the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.T;The Posadnik of the Republic of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.D;The Scandinavian-appointed governor of Pskov, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, has been killed by a riot soon after his re-election. The sudden loss of foreign influence over the Pskovian Veche allowed the Russian boyars to independently choose the city's Posadnik, opting for a compromise figure: Adam Grundel-Helmfelt, the Duke of Narva. Adam is a Stockholm-born entrepreneur and Ingria's richest landowner, who has gained the admiration of Russian boyars with calls for fair representation and administrative reform. After his proclamation as Posadnik, Adam "Nerevsky" (from Narva, a sobriquet on "Nevskij" coined by Finnish colonists) has promulgated a new constitution, abolishing most political privileges of the Finnic minority. De facto this doesn't change much in our protectorate, as almost all the political power is in his hands, but tolerating Pskov's self-rule and pro-Slavic legislation may slowly slip the Republic away from our control. How shall we react? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.A;We shall accept the status quo ... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.B;Perhaps we need to make it clear to this upstart who rules in Pskov?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.D;The whole of Ingria has finally come under direct Scandinavian rule. An autonomous dependency has been set up to administer the territory with the eventual goal of integrating the province directly into the Scandinavian state. After a brief spat with the Novgorodians, mare nostrum Balticum has been reaffirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191955.A;No longer shall Finland and Livonia be threatened from the east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.D;After reaching an agreement with the Scandinavians, Pskov has been allowed to rejoin the Novgorodian Confederation as a constituent republic. While the Scandinavians still hold hostage our access to the Baltic, today is nonetheless a victory for Novgorod the Great. Cries of jubilation can be heard all throughout the republic as our brothers have been reunited with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191956.A;Perhaps one day we may also regain the Baltic coastline ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.T;The expulsion of the Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.D;Scandinavia has extended citizenship rights and protection to all Finnic people, regardless of the country of origin, leading to the overnight annexation of our Karelian territories and the expulsion of our Pomor compatriots who had settled in the region. This blatant violation of the long-standing border treaty with the Empire of the North has caused great outrage in the Novgorodian Veche and most of the city's notables are petitioning for vengeance against foreign invaders and the expulsion of Finnic and Scandinavian nationals from the Republic. Bowing to Copenhagen's will means tainting the secular pride of Novgorodian independence, but denouncing the aggression will remove the political and military protection that lets this pride live on despite threats from the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.A;It's a terrible price to pay if we want to safeguard our Republic's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.B;We shall redraw the western border with our swords and their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.T;The Pskov Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.D;Pan-Russianism has experienced a resurgence in the Republic of Pskov in the wake of the creation of a Russian nation-state. The Russian-majority population of the Republic widely supports the prospect of annexation by Russia but the Finnish boyars who dominate the government enjoy the privileges independence affords them. Recently, however, we have been approached by a group of pro-Russian patriots that promises to seize control of the Veche and proclaim annexation to Russia. They claim that the Pskovian army, composed primarily of Russians, considers Russian annexation favorable -- or at the very least not unfavorable -- and that they would not act to prevent the uprising. Such a move would certainly be more diplomatically palatable than a military invasion of the Republic, though we must still be wary of the Scandinavian response to our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.A;Pskov must join the Russian fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.D;Their work was swift. In the dead of the long Russian night, pan-Russian insurgents had stormed the Veche and seized control over the Republic. The Pskovian army was powerless to stop them, with Russian officers unwilling to fire upon their fellow countrymen and many even rallying to the cause of the rebels. Already, these insurgents have proclaimed the Republic annexed to Russia, and the Russian army has swooped in to take over control from these rebels -- not, however, before the Scandinavian army could seize the fortress at Nyenschanz. The situation remains tense, but one thing remains certain: the Republic of Pskov is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.A;A sad day for the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.T;The Stain on Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more. At one time, the Scandinavians had set up a military administration in its place, but now what was once a Scandinavian governorate has become an independent nation. The basic structure administering the territory has not changed, however, with the predominantly Finnish-Scandinavian ruling class marginalizing the Russian-majority population of the territory. This situation is a stain on the honor of the Russian nation, and nationalists both at home and abroad have called for our government to intervene on the behalf of our oppressed countrymen. Our agents have been covertly organizing the Russian population of Ingria with the promise of Russian support for their revolt, and now the time has come to make good on this pledge. We must wipe this stain off of the maps of Europe and complete the unification of the Russian nation!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.A;We must drive out these Scandinavian freebooters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.T;The Collapse of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.D;Our fledgling administration was always one built on an unstable foundation. Originating as a march of Scandinavia, our nation since its inception has been ruled by force of arms, and not with the consent of the masses. Since our independence from Scandinavia, our ability to provide for our armies has suffered greatly, and with nationalist tensions mounting with the recent unification of Russia it should come as no surprise that our meagre forces have been quickly overrun by a country-wide nationalist revolt. The whole of Ingermanland has been seized by these rebels and transferred to Russian control, barring the fortress at Nyenschanz, which has been hastily occupied by our evacuating forces. What still exists of our army has defected back to our former Scandinavian overlords, ensuring that in both fact and name Ingermanland no longer exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.A;It was only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.T;The Problem of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying us access to the Baltic. Chafing under Scandinavian suzerainty, and inspired by our recent national unification, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of our new nation. While the revolt was ultimately put down via Scandinavian intervention, the magnitude of the revolt has turned the opinions of the great powers of Europe largely against Scandinavian rule. With Russia now united under our rule, and Scandinavia diplomatically isolated on this issue, we have seen fit to press the claims of these nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.A;Pskov will be liberated from the Scandinavian tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.T;The Treaty of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying the Russians access to the Baltic. Chafing under our suzerainty, and inspired by the recent unification of the Russian princes, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of the newly-formed Russian nation. While we succeeded in restoring power to the surviving members of the Veche, the Russians have decided to press the claims of these rebels, and after witnessing the scope of the uprising the rest of the great powers of Europe generally agree that we should make some concessions to the Russians living in the territory./n /n Having succeeded in isolating us, our only diplomatic recourse now is to reach a settlement favorable to the Russians that at least ensures our security in Finland and Livonia. Should the Russians reject our offer there can be no doubt that they will take this opportunity to seize Pskov for themselves. There are some who believe that war may be a good thing, however. If we were to triumph over the Russians on the field of battle, they would be forced to recognize our control over Pskov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.A;The Russians may have Pskov, but we will retain Nyenschanz as a matter of national security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.B;Never! The Gate of Russia is ours alone to open and close at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.T;An Offer from Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.D;Having been forced to the negotiating table, Copenhagen has approached us with a highly favorable treaty in which the majority of Pskov will be immediately annexed to us. Scandinavia will maintain control only over their fortress at Nyenschanz and only for a period of 15 years as they prepare adequate defenses elsewhere in Finland, after which point they promise to hand the territory over to us. Of course, the Scandinavians may always renege on that promise, but perhaps that is a risk worth taking. If our interests in the north are not that great, a friendly neighbor in Scandinavia will certainly prove a valuable asset as we direct our attention in other directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.A;This is everything we could have hoped for! We will accept their treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.B;We cannot tolerate Scandinavian control over the mouth of the Neva for even one more minute! Nyenschanz shall be ours immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.D;Once again the great powers of Europe have convened to decide the fate of an independent nation and once again that nation was not party to their negotiations. While the Scandinavians supported us in putting down that nationalist revolt they have now backstabbed us at the negotiation table. Russia and Scandinavia have mutually agreed to partition our nation, with the Republic of Pskov henceforth being no more in the eyes of the world. The Pskovian Veche has with great sorrow assembled for one last time to pass a measure confirming the dissolution of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.A;Perhaps someday an international organization may exist to protest these infringements on national sovereignty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.D;The Scandinavians thought that they could placate us with empty promises and half-hearted efforts at reconciliation. But no! We reject any offer from Copenhagen short of the complete unification of the Russian nation, and to that end we have declared a state of war with Scandinavia. Pskov has declared itself an indivisible part of the Russian nation and we intend on making good on that fact. Scandinavia shall not deny us our heritage, and they shall not throttle our access to the Baltic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.A;We shall teach them the might of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.T;Humiliation from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.D;Our forces have been soundly defeated by the armies of Russia! As part of the peace agreement, we have been forced to recognize as valid the declaration from those upstart nationalists. The whole of Pskov shall be immediately annexed to Russia without partition. In return, the Russians have withdrawn their occupation forces from Finland and Livonia, restoring our control over the regions. With the loss of Ingria, our holdings in Finland and Livonia are no longer connected by land, and the loss of the fortress at Nyenschanz has left both Finland and Livonia undefended from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.A;Well, at least we still have Finland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.D;The peasant hordes of Russia proved to be no match for the professional armies of Scandinavia! The Russian bear lies before us, defeated and discredited, leaving us free to act as we please with respect to Ingria. Having recognized how the nominally independent Republic of Pskov failed to defend our interests against the mounting nationalist pressures of the population, we have seen fit to dissolve the republic and replace it with a military commission to govern the region directly under the control of Copenhagen. The Ingermanland March, as it is known, will pave the way for Scandinavian and Finnish settlement in the region, ensuring the future loyalty of the territory and the smooth transition to eventual Scandinavian integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.A;Pskov has served its purpose. Now Copenhagen has taken control of the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more, and in its place we have set up a military administration over its former territories. The measures that the Ingermanland March has taken to ensure the loyalty of the territories have been admittedly harsh, with the forcible relocation of large parts of the Russian population being commonplace, amongst other practices. Recent publications of accounts of our rule, while clearly heavily embellished, have nonetheless caused outrage throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, creating a crisis over the region. How this ultimately plays out remains to be seen, but for now we have taken direct control over the affected regions from the Ingermanland March as a temporary measure in order to quell the immediate concerns over our march’s governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.A;Oops ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.D;Accounts of Scandinavian atrocities in Ingria have circulated for a while now, but for the first time we now have definitive proof of their conduct in the territory. Papers containing orders to seize the lands of Russian landowners, and forged documents detailing the transfer of property from said landowners to Scandinavian and Finnish settlers have been intercepted. Mass graves of Russian peasants have been uncovered and photographed, as have the deserted villages from which they originated. Newspapers all across Europe are now publishing accounts of these atrocities, inflaming public opinion against the Scandinavian occupation. At this point, we could either send an ultimatum to the Scandinavians, demanding reparations for their violence and the transfer of those lands inhabited by a Russian majority, or we could forgo asking entirely and simply seize the entirety of the Ingermanland March. Either way, our cause is just, and the great powers of Europe are unlikely to intervene against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.A;These barbarians are not fit to govern Russians! Demand the land and reparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.B;We must seize the whole of Ingria and punish them for these deplorable acts of violence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.T;The Russian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.D;The Russians have sent us an ultimatum. In it, they demand that we cede to them those territories in Ingria inhabited by a Russian-majority population. They have also demanded financial reparations on behalf of the victims, both real and imagined, of our rule over the region. Do we give in to their demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.A;The Russians have isolated us. We have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.B;A hundred thousand men will lie dead before we cede an inch of soil to the Russians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.T;A Baltic Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.D;While we do not necessarily lack a Baltic coastline, that short stretch we do control is unsuitable for the construction of any sort of harbor. As a result, most of our northern trade continues to flow to the rest of Europe via the Neva, allowing the Scandinavians to maintain a stranglehold on our trade with their control of Nyenschanz. With the rise of a unified Russian economy and the growing economic prosperity it has brought us, the situation has reached a point where it has become necessary to gain free access to the markets of Europe, whether that be by direct control over the Neva estuary or some other agreement with the Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.A;Perhaps the Scandinavians can accommodate us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.T;The Conference of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.D;While the Conference of Helsinki quickly concluded that the Scandinavian straits should be free and open to international traffic, the original issue that prompted negotiations in the first place -- that of Scandinavian Ingria -- remained unresolved. The proposal that seemed to have the most traction was to partition the Ingermanland March, with Scandinavia retaining the fortress at Nyenschanz in order to defend Finland while Russia gains a length of coastline suitable for the construction of a new port. Russia would also be exempt from paying the large indemnity we receive for abolishing the toll. Another proposal, albeit less popular, was to cede the entirety of Ingria to the Russians in exchange for their recognition of our sovereignty over Karelia. Still others are frustrated with these negotiations in the first place, having become upset that the issue has resulted in the loss of the Sound Toll, and maintain that we ought at least retain the whole of Ingria for having lost this major source of state revenue. (ONLY REJECTION IS POSSIBLE IN CURRENT BUILD);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.A;We have already lost our right to the Sound Toll. Ingria is where we draw the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.D;Negotiations have broken down between us and the Scandinavians. They insist on maintaining their stranglehold on our access to the Baltic, which to us is unacceptable. We will make Scandinavia pay for their crimes against the Russian nation as we seize the whole of Ingria from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.A;They shall soon know to fear the Russian bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.T;The Loss of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.D;Vae Victis! Woe to the defeated! With our forces crushed by the armies of Russia, we are forced to recognize the Russian annexation of Ingria and the loss of our claims to the territory. In return, the Russians have agreed to withdraw from Finland and Livonia, though who knows how long until the Russians come back to seize those as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.A;We have been humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.T;The Humiliation of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.D;Victory! Our armies stand victorious over the battered Russian bear! As part of the treaty creating peace between our two nations, the Russians have been forced to pay a large indemnity for damages caused by their armies to the property of Scandinavian citizens. The Russians have also been forced to recognize our control over Ingria “in perpetuity.” How long “perpetuity” is in actuality remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the humiliation Russia has experienced at our hands will forbid them from Ingria for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.A;The Russian bear has been declawed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARA1.T;The Crown of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.D;The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja, which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possesions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples, his brother and heir Ferran VI, died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV, Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive, for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them, Milan may especially prove troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.T;The escape of Maria Borja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.D;Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan, Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples. While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy, she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions, the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. In the night of the 25th February 1837, she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria, heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.A;Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.T;Maria Borgia, future duchess of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.D;Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I, the prince of Legnano, in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes, with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri. Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General, Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke, Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon, as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo, the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily, so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.A;Maria will become Queen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI2.T;The Imperial Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI2.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Joseph. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, the emperor and his family ended in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Joseph crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI2.A;Vivat Imperator in aeternum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI3.T;The Imperial coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI3.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Ferdinando. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, Ferdinando made a great speech at the ruins of the Coliseum about his late father who paved the way for the success of the crown of Aragon. The emperor and his family ended their tour of the city in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Ferdinando crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI3.A;Vivat Imperator in aeternum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.T;Troubles in the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.D;None thought that proclaiming the Empire would solve all problems in the Western Mediterranean but the young empire faces several oppositions that could spell the end of the Serna dream. First the Pope, angered by the Imperial coronation and the reduction of his temporal powers, is proving to be hard to manage, especially as the devout hordes of catholics in the South and the rest of the Empire look up to him. The northern princes of Italy have not stayed idle either, with Marianists gathering support against what they consider our illegitimate rule. And Catalonia, once the center of the Crown, has seen various liberal and nationalist agitators advocating for an independent and republican Catalonia. We must be careful not to upset these groups if we don't want to see the end of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.A;We will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC1.T;The Rzeczpospolita;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLC1.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC2.T;The death of Maximilian III;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.D;The king of the Commonwealth has died in Warsaw after 20 years of rule mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his Kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maximilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto (the right for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly) and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. Despite his political weakness he leaves a good memory to the citizens of Warsaw that have gathered in huge crowds for his funeral. Now the prepatory Sejm will convene to select candidates to his succession, with his son Stanislaw in good place to succeed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.A;Farewell Maksymilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.T;The Sejm in deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.D;The Sejm has been convened for already several months and has not been able to advance a definitive list of candidates to the succession of Maximilian III. The main problem resides in the candidacy of his son Stanislaw, a well-known Liberal and independent noble which is seen as a threat by both the foreign powers of Scandinavia and Bohemia but also by the most powerful nobles of the country who fear he will try to rescind their privileges. The liberation of his serfs in his own domain in 1833 was already widely criticized by the Magnateria while giving Stanislaw widespread popularity outside of the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.A;Will they be able to elect someone already ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.T;The Black procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.D;Following the deadlock of the prepatory Sejm, several prominent members of the Polish bourgeoisie (including delegates from Kiev, Danzig or Vilnius) gathered in the streets of the capital to hasten the process and demanding more rights for the people no belonging to the nobility. The burghers had been protesting the difference of treatment for years but it was the first time such an event was organized. While the mayor of Warsaw, Michael Konopka, was officially the main organizer of the march, it is widely understood that this was coordinated by Stanislaw Habsburg to strengthen his partisans in the Sejm. While completely pacific, going against Stanislaw could prove to provoke troubles with the Liberal movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.A;The 'people' is manipulated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC5.T;Choosing the candidates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC5.D;Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts and of the principality of Smolensk the Sejm continued to be deadlocked. Eventually the Sejm would have to choose the candidates for the election. After weeks of debates 4 candidates demarked themselves : Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobility. Johannes von Wettin cousin of the duke of Prussia supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw Habsburg is put into the list or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC5.A;Stanislaw is on the list, he cannot be elected anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC8.T;The Warsaw Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC8.D;Democratic liberals in $COUNTRY$ have been ignored for a long time, the nobles ruling the country being content with allowing expression of discontent but doing nothing about it. The government of Warsaw has discovered a liberal plot to kill the current King and replace him with the shunned candidate Stanislaw Habsburg who would promulgate several reforms and abolish the Golden liberties. This plot was denounced by one of his members and the Army has raided the houses of the main leaders while an attempt of seditious members of the people to rise against us was squashed in blood. Most of the leaders were convicted of treason and executed while Stanislaw, who was apparently not aware of the conspiracy, has fled the country to avoid such a fate. The Rzeczpospolita endures, and the dominance of the Nobles as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC9.T;The Sejm of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC9.D;Following his election, Stanislaw I tried several times to assemble a confederated Sejm, a type of assembly where the liberum veto could not be used as to pass several laws and appease the liberals of the various towns. Despite all his efforts, the opposition of the nobility led to no consensus and he was forced to call a regular Sejm that was blocked by several noblemen who used their golden liberties to stop all attempts at reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC9.A;When will they understand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC10.T;The Warsaw riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC10.D;Following the results of the Sejm, the liberals and people of Warsaw assaulted several noblemen notoriously known for their opposition to reforms in the capital. Order was only restored after the intervention of the Royal guards, with the King himself protecting his opponent Jozef Potocki who found shelter in the Royal Palace after nearly being killed by the crowd. This event has reinforced the will of the reformers who are now persuaded that only them stand between chaos and the preservation of order while magnates are scared and hire more members for their guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC11.T;Opening of the Sejm of 1847;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC11.D;The King has finally obtained a confederated Sejm for the reforms, with several magnates rallying to the cause.

PLC12.T;The March constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC12.D;The Sejm of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has managed to defeat the Magnate opposition and implemented a wide series of reforms for the country : universal suffrage, end of serfdom, renewed federalism and independence from foreign countries. Crowds rejoice in the country as a brighter future appears for the Polish masses but in the same time the nobility and foreign powers intend to crush this democratic revolution. Meanwhile Stanislaw Habsburg has gained an impressive popularity and the old elective monarchy has been abolished, with his sons to succeed him as constitutional monarchs in the decades to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC13.D;While the Constitution was well accepted in Poland and Lithuania, the Uman Confederation has declared neutrality and took over the Ruthenian territories to 'protect' them from the instability.

Now the Jagiellons of Prague have annexed western Poland while putting a cadet of their family on the throne of 'Poland', the first in 300 years. Little Poland has been reorganized as the duchy of Galicia with its capital in Krakow, while the Baltic coast has also been taken from Poland with Lithuania now a Scandinavian puppet. The only winners of this terrible treaty are the Ruthenians who have been given most of their claims in exchange for staying out of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##################### The New Bohemian Events (Coded by Attalus, Localized by Periares #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH1.T;The Inauguration of the Wenceslaus V Plaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.D;Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V reigned during the years of the German Revolution and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning intellect, he was able to quell the revolts of the German liberals within the Holy Roman Empire and fought coalitions of various powers who were keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe. But he was too successful for his own good, and "the Lion of the North", as he was called after his successes at slaying Scandinavian battalions, was eventually forced to sue for peace. Wenceslaus would be murdered the following year and would be succeeded by his son, Sigismund V. Sigismund V today opened a plaza in Prague which openly embraced his reactionary father in a pompous ceremony and promised that his father's successes will be emulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.A;The people celebrate an Empire of a thousand years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.T;Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.D;Sigismund V came to power in a tender age of 10 after his father was unceremoniously assassinated. German liberals deny their involvement in this affair, and there are indeed rumours that it was done by the hands of the Bohemian aristocracy, but it was always clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of the German liberals. Despite his unfortunate early upbringing, he has shown to inherit many of his father’s desires for statecraft, and his desire to unite the HRE under a Bohemian leadership. His staunch reactionary political motivations make him unpopular beyond the Bohemian borders, but his promises for a return to glory make him popular among our aristocrats. Time will tell if his dreams would come to pass under his reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.A;An industrious man for an industrial era!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.D;Risen from ruins, the German liberal cause did not die after the failed revolution at the end of the last century. Indeed, it continued today as several students, scholars and judges remembered the large banquet on the Zeil, a renowned street in the city centre of Frankfurt thirty years ago. After some festivities, the petty noble and Grand Judge of the city of Dortmund had proclaimed in a moment of silence that resistance to the Bohemian yoke and the tyranny of the aristocracy shall not end, that those who fight for the cause will not separate and reassemble wherever it is required, until a Constitution for the HRE is established. Needless to say, the potentates of Germany and beyond are shocked that these acts of treason are still celebrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.A;Nothing bad ever happened to Frankfurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.D;The Court in Anvers was informed today that several renowned German liberals were holding a banquet in remembrance to the Zeil Oath, indeed an act of treason of the German liberals against the established order, in Frankfurt. While the upper echelons of the Burgundian society reacted in shock, most Germans within our borders either reacted with mild amusement or ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the heart of the German nation. Only time can tell now, whether the German liberals will reignite the fire in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While the Bohemian heartland, which is despised by the German liberals, reacted in shock, our Elbian and Danubian subjects within our borders reacted either with mild amusement or ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the true heart of the German nation.

While the upper echelons of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society could only watch in awe, the lower levels reacted either wild amusement or sheer ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the true heart of the German nation.

BOH7.T;Creation of the Wolfgang Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.D;The elder branch of the House of Jagiellon, to which the kings of Bohemia belong, deeply distrust the intentions of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karlstein, which would succeed to the throne of Bohemia should the senior branch die out. Sigismund Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein is the head of this cadet branch which grew infamous during the Great German War for having championed the liberal cause. This eventually led to the assassination of the father of Wolfgang, who dropped his first two names which were associated with the elder branch. Today, Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein announced in Dresden the creation of the Wolfgang Society which occupies itself with reformist tendencies, which seem to have gained ground among our population. Further observation of the situation is the only thing we can do for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.A;Reforms? In Bohemia? With Sigismund V?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.D;In the years after the Great German War, the Grand Duchy of Franconia, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold, had transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany. Duke Leopold IV and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are part for the reason for the announcement of former author and today's chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Franconian throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.A;The Duke will be remembered fondly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.D;In a lunatic statement of the Franconian chancellory, liberal reforms have swept through the Grand Duchy of Franconia which already housed a number of exiled German poets and other apologists. While this is a clear affront to the Bohemian authority over Germany and can only be resolved through a brutal 'restoration of the status quo', the liberal factions of our court proposed the acceptance of this Franconian Charter of Rights to prevent bloodshed. This, however, would threaten our position as a reactionary stronghold of Germany and open the gates for vile Burgundian and Scandinavian influence. Sigismund V's cabinet has decided that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.A;"... we must defend the Empire from this Charter!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.B;"... war shall be no more.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.T;Sigismund V's intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.D;In a tragic twist of unfortunate events, Sigismund V was convinced by the scheming part of  his cabinet of ministers that he should overrule the decision met by the cabinet and to declare war on Franconia to remove the Franconian Charter of Rights and to remove the liberal Grand Duke Leopold IV. While this made the king unpopular among the higher levels of the Bohemian government, it was welcomed by fellow reactionary governments in Central Europe who fear that the Charter might find followers elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.A;Sigismund V shall guide us to our triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.T;The $YEAR$ Fire of Nuremberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.D;During the Bohemian Invasion of Nuremberg, a siege conducted by Bohemian soldiers led to a hellfire setting the city ablaze. Hundreds were killed, and Duke Leopold IV of Franconia was forced to flee his palace and found refuge in Londres. Wildly condemned to be willfully perpetrated by ill-willed Bohemian corporals, Sigismund V denied any involvement. The Burning of Nuremberg ended the reign of the liberal Leopold IV and the installation of his younger, more reactionary brother Hermann III as a Bohemian puppet. The anger over the fire will inevitably change the geopolitics of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH12.D;The Närmberchlied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit" (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, the Danubians have begun to use these three words as a slogan against the Bohemian authority and to end their arbitrary rule over the lands of the Danube.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH14.D;The Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was a thinly veiled insult and exclusion of the Bohemian people to the German cultural group and was not long after its first publication in Leipzig banned in the Kingdom of Bohemia. And yet, this ban only made this forbidden song, in the wake of recent events in Franconia, more popular among our youth and beyond our borders as more and more liberal secret societies are forming around a single, unifying line of the Nürnberglied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH15.T;The Defenestration of Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.D;What started as a crackdown of a liberal association of students in Dresden quickly escalated into a nationwide series of revolts against the absolute and arbitrary rule of Sigismund V which has now strained one nerve too many: the Royal Guard, fed up with the destructive rule of Sigismund V, stormed the royal palace of Prague and forced his abdication in favour of Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein. And yet, Sigismund, as ambitious as one knows him, tried to flee in the same night and was caught by a corporal in a narrow street of the Wenceslaus V Plaza. Fueled by blind anger, the citizens forced Sigismund V to climb up the The Church of Our Lady of the Snows and was promptly defenestrated from the top of the bell tower, killing the former Emperor instantaneously on impact with the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, with the ascension of liberal Ludwig Wolfgang I to the crown of Bohemia, who ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. And thus, he officially abdicated the position of (nominal) Holy Roman Emperor, with no successor to follow in his place. The Holy Roman Empire no longer exists, and yet Bohemia and all of Germany marches onwards, as the rays of dawn cover a new horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, when Sigismund V, now pressured by liberal faction within his court who were able to outmaneuver reactionary aristocrats after the Great Fire of Nuremberg, today declared his abdication of the Holy Roman Crown, with no successor to follow in his place. Instead, as an attempt to stabilize the Kingdom of Bohemia, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Bohemia, ruling from $YEAR$ onwards as Emperor Sigismund I of Bohemia. This marks the end of the Thousand Years' Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH18.D;In the light of the coronation of Ludwig Wolfgang I, he ordered the arrest of the 37 citizens of Prague responsible for the Defenestration of previous king Sigismund V. These men, now simply dubbed "The 37 of Prague" were ordered to be executed for the extra-judicial maiming of the former head of the Jagiellon Dynasty. This move, although expected and understood to be out of fear that this regicide might become a source of inspiration for even more radical factions of Europe, was only announced after the 37 of Prague were judged by the High Court of Bohemia and executed through hanging on the outskirts of the capital. The feared reaction did not manifest itself, however. No tear was shed by the peasantry over these faceless agitators, and there were no celebrations held over their death in the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TAR2.T;Peace in the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.D;The past few years have seen the Western Pontic steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the scale of violence and destruction seen during the XVIIth and XVIIIth century in the Wild Fields between Ukraine, Russia and Tatarstan. While in the West the Zaporizhian and Dnieper hosts watch the unstable Polish-Lithuanian south-eastern borders, the Don Cossacks have recognized the Prince of Ryazan as their liege. Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids still happen it will need a change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts on the warpath. Should we unite into a single host, we might become one of the great powers of the East, and teach freedom to the oppressive magnates from the Commonwealth and the boyars from Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.A;We will see how long it lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR6.T;A new situation in the Dyke Pole;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.D;The Wild Fields, this area from the Pontic Steppe fought between bands of Slavic warriors and mercenaries who call themselves the Cossacks and the Tatar khanates has seen much bloodshed in the past centuries. The Cossacks hosts fought the Tatars, Russian and Polish ambitions, and amongst themselves while attracting serfs and slaves from their neighbors lured by the freedom of the Cossack lifestyle. The Wild fields had enjoyed an era of relative peace in the past few years but this status quo has been broken as the Cossack hosts now gather their men to face a new situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.A;What will happen to these lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a renowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War, and now, with the influence of Constantinople shinking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has begun to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR11.T;Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR11.D;The Khan is dead, long live the Khan! Murad II, the renowned general and scholar, has succeeded in exiling his borther and taking the throne. He has promised to end obscurantism in the Khanate and to restore the rightful place of the Tatars as masters of the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203511.A;A new era for Crimea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.T;Standardization of the Tatar Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.D;Of the many reforms implemented by Murad II, the codification of the Tatar language is often seen as his most important legacy. Prior to the standardization of the Tatar language, various different dialects of the Tatar language were spoken throughout the Wild Fields, all with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Literacy remained low amongst the Tatar peoples, in part due to their migratory nature but also largely due to the difficulty of learning the Arabic script the language was traditionally written in. Under the direction of Murad II, a new script based on the Roman one was developed for the Tatar language, and spellings and grammatical conventions were codified largely from the Crimean dialect. This allowed for the written language to be significantly easier to learn for both foreigners and native speakers, and opened up Crimea to an influx of Western ideas and literature. While the new standard was not initially popular outside the lands of the Crimean Khanate, with time these conventions would come to be adopted as the Standard Tatar language, especially as a Tatar national awakening began to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203512.A;How do you read this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.T;Military Reforms of Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.D;Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the early successes of the Crimean state were Murad II’s reforms of the army of the Crimean Khanate. Having studied Western military tactics and doctrine of the last century, and having witnessed their effectiveness during the Ottoman Civil War, Murad II had become convinced of the need for military reform. While the previous hybridization of Turkish and Cossack military doctrines had fared well against the irregular forces normally encountered in the steppes by Tatar regiments, such tactics fared poorly in an open engagement between regular military forces. Thus, under Murad II, the lance was discarded in favor of the smoothbore, and a highly disciplined army unfettered by the cossack soldier’s intimidation or provocation was formed. While initially unpopular, Murad II’s military reforms ensured the long-term survival of the Crimean state in the face of encroaching Cossack and Russian expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203513.A;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.T;The Unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.D;Both the Russian principalities and the Cossack hosts have been hungrily eyeing Tatar lands for decades now, and both have been growing in power in recent years. For the Tatars to remain free from foreign subjugation, they must be united into a single nation powerful enough to resist foreign incursions. As the only Tatar polity to even resemble a modern state, the mantle falls upon us to unite our brethren under our benevolent rule and to drive the Russians and Cossacks out of Tatarstan. Our first step lies in the conquest of our neighbors to the north, the Astrakhan Khanate. While none of the Tatar khanates remain unscathed from the times of the Departure, the Astrakhan Khanate was the one most devastated by the conquests of the Cossack hordes. Despite decades having passed, the Astrakhan Khanate has yet to recover, only staving off foreign conquest due to the relative worthlessness of their lands to the Russians and the constantly shifting political situation amongst the principalities. Before the political tides change in Russia, we must conquer them and utilize what resources they do have to strengthen our own position in the Wild Lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.A;The Astrakhan Khanate is weak. We must seize the advantage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.B;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.T;Conquest of Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.D;The Khanate of Kazan has been in slow decline for decades, and has only recently begun to recover from the Chayka Rebellion. With the Khan of Kazan increasingly relying on foreign support to maintain his rule, Kazan teeters on the edge of becoming little more than a Ryazanian client state. Before the Ryazanians can make their move, we must invade the Khanate of Kazan, and with our armies now experienced in the use of new tactics and weaponry after our conquest of Astrakhan we will no doubt make quick work of any forces Kazan may throw at us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.A;Surely our armies will not stop with just Astrakhan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.B;Perhaps it would be wise not to be too ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.T;Djihad for Saraj the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.D;Saraj the Great. Located in the approximate geographical center of Tatar culture, this city represents much to the myriad peoples of the Steppes. Prior to its conquest by the Akhtuba Host, the city was the main source of wealth and power for the Astrakhan Khanate, controlling portage between the Don and Volga Rivers, and was even briefly the capital of the khanate after the Dzungar sack of Astrakhan. With the loss of the city to the peasant armies of Zarubin Chayka, the Astrakhan Khanate was left in shambles, and the whole Tatar nation was shaken by the loss of that magnificent city to the Cossack heathens. With our recent unification of the Tatar nation, prominent imams all across Tatar lands have called for a Djihad for the reconquest of Saraj the Great. We now stand at a crossroad; on one hand, such a move would surely unite the diverse peoples of our newfound Tatar state under a single banner, and would obtain for us a worthy city for the capital of our new nation. On the other hand, the fall of the Akhtuba Host would certainly rouse the other formerly neutral Cossack hosts into action against us, potentially creating an enemy we are not prepared to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.A;Onwards to Saraj the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.B;We must not provoke the Hosts into uniting against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.T;The Fall of the Akhtuba Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.D;Truly, Allah is on our side! The heathens of the Akhtuba Host have fallen before our invincible armies, and much of the remaining Cossack interlopers have been driven out or killed. Saraj the Great now lies in our hands, never again to fall to the infidel. So claim the devout amongst us, anyway. Already, however, Cossack riders have been spotted broaching our borders, and cross-border raids from the remaining hosts have nearly ceased altogether. The more cautious warn that this is the calm before the storm, and that cossack forces are preparing for a massive war the likes of which has not been seen since the end of the cossack Departure. Whatever the case may be, should the remaining cossack hosts decide to mobilize against us, they will not find us unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.A;Let their armies break before us like waves crashing on a rocky shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.T;The People of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.D;While nominally a nation united by Islam and opposition to Russian expansion, there exist great disparities between the various different peoples that constitute the Tatar nation. The Tatars of Crimea have long been within the Ottoman cultural sphere, while the Tatars of Kazan have grown to share certain commonalities with their Russian neighbors to the north. In addition to this, recent overtures in Crimea to opening up to the West have led to an influx of ideas regarding secularization and the rights of man throughout the lands of the former khanate, meanwhile large parts of the Tatar population outside of Crimea have grown to resent this trend of increasing liberalism in Crimea. These two factions will almost certainly create much friction as the new Tatar nation struggles to define what it exactly means to be a “Tatar.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.A;To be a Tatar is to live free from foreign yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.T;Troubles brewing in Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.D;Unlike its northern neighbours, the Princedom of Ryazan holds little esteem for the title of Prince and has embraced the tradition of elective monarchy of its most powerful neighbour, albeit sugar-coating it with token remembrances of ancient Slavic customs. The Ryazanian Duma has always picked a Repnin since the union of the princess Anastasia with Nicholas Repnin, but the possibility of declaring loyalty to a charismatic unifier, like during the time of the Troubles, remains a very possible outcome. The real power in Ryazan thus lies not in the hands of the Prince but in the hands of the nobility leaders assembled in the Duma. Currently, Michael II Repnin rules in Ryazan and his fondness of military affairs (that gave him the nickname of 'Prince-in-the-barracks') has led many boyars to believe that he is not very interested in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.A;It will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.T;The coup of Michael II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.D;Despite appearances, Michael II, the so-called 'Prince-in-the-barracks' had been creating an ever-growing network of collaborators, especially among the Cossacks from the Don Host. His contempt for serfdom and boyar excesses has become more and more evident over the past few months and he finally decided to make his opinion known by assembling the Duma in his palace of Ryazan. Cossacks then surrounded the chamber where Michael II had called the nobles, while he attempted to proclaim the dissolution of the assembly and his reign as autocrat of Ryazan. The boyars were taken by surprise at first, but soon fighting erupted as the nobles launched their own retinues against the Cossack guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.A;The Coup is successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.B;Boyars take control of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.D;Michael II had succeeded in his coup. He is now autocrat of Ryazan with all power over the state, a feat that no Prince of Ryazan has managed since the times of Alexander II Repnin 'the Gunpowder Prince.' The Boyars' have been crushed, many lying dead and the few remaining either rallied to him or are in shackles. One of the first actions he took was the release of the Don Host from their allegiance. Cossacks had helped him access true power, and he thus had to pay his debt to them. However the alliance between the ataman Beketov and the prince endured, and Michael II still retained many Cossack advisors in his court and own army. Among them was the notorious commander of the guard, soon promoted to general of the Prince's armies, Yemelyan Razin, who was soon to be recognized as one of the finest commanders of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.A;Until another day, Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.T;Victory of the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.D;The fight begun by Michael II ended poorly for the Prince. As the Boyars fought for their lives, the Prince himself was killed in the fray of battle, with his Cossack guards either meeting the same fate or surrendering. The Boyars soon crowned the nephew of Michael II, Pyotr Repnin as his successor. A weak boy aged 13, he would be no danger to the power of the Duma. The various nobles now had to take a stance towards the Don Host. The ataman Pyotr Beketov has already announced that he was loyal to the Prince and did not recognize the new prince, hosting the son of Michael II, Alexander, in their territory as the legitimate heir. We could let these peasants go as they have been a thorn in our side for decades or move to directly annex them, although that may stir the other Cossacks against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.A;Let the Host go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.B;We will take back our lands from this 'host'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.T;The Cossack threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.D;As we feared the Cossacks have united following our takeover of the Don host. While it may seem unimportant, these Cossacks claim the lands we have taken and thus could strike against us when the fight with the other principalities begin. It is thus of the utmost importance that we strike first and place various loyal atamans to rule the steppe in our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR25.A;Down with the Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.T;Victory over the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.D;The feared Cossack bands were no matched for the armies of Ryazan who crushed their resistance and forced them to come to terms. The general Rada would be abolished, with the various hosts created again with loyal atamans placed at their helm. Now the South waits for Ryazan and soon Russian orders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.A;A mighty victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.T;Defeat in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.D;Our ambitions were too grandoise, and our armies could not defeat the bands of hastily prepared peasants of the South. We have lost our opportunity to create a strong state in the South and may never gain such an opportunity again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.A;A sad day for Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.T;Renew the Departure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.D;The Akhtuba host was founded as the last free Cossack host, on the ruins of the Chayka rebellion and the Turgut attack on the Astrakhani. We have spent decades defeating the various Tatar rebellions and raiders in our territory but it is not enough. As the princes of the North and even the Tatars themselves change, we must also renew our conquests of the Wild Lands and end the Astrakhani khanate once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.A;Let us end the Mohamedan !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.B;We can’t do that…;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.T;The Ukrainian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.D;Ukraine has been formed in the West by the various Cossack hosts as a means of protecting our way of life from invaders. We were not included in the original deal because of our power and also fierce independence, but as years go on and we see the stability brought by this new state, it seems to many that it would be in our interest to join our brothers under one Host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.A;Ukraine is the path forward !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.B;Our independence can’t be negotiated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR30.T;The Akhtuba Cossacks join us !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR30.A;Long live Ukraine !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR31.T; Stepan Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.D;As the Cossack hosts finally threw out the Polish officials and declared independence, the Dnieper host elected Stepan Sternenko as their new Hetman. A renowned mercenary who was forbidden by Warsaw to come back to his homeland because of his experience in the German Wars and also the Hungarian Independence War, he is widely seen as one of the Cossack national heroes. But his friends and allies know that his ambitions are wild and he sees himself as the successor of the Blue Hetman, Semen Bilozersky that had unified the people of Ukraine against the Commonwealth. And he is ready to destroy anyone who might try to hinder his work.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.A;Who does he think he is ?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.T;Sternenko’s move;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.D;As the Rada convened in Kharkov, Hetman Sternenko began his speech by referring to the Blue Hetman uprising of the XVIIth century. Since his defeat, Cossacks in Western Ukraine had lived under the Polish boot and the various hosts were used as pawns for foreign designs. With their new independence, the Dnieper Cossacks were designated by God to unify the Wild Lands, by force if need be, and for this to happen, Sternenko demanded full war-powers and the end of the Rada convenings until unification. As the votes are cast …;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.A;Sternenko secures power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR32.B;Sternenko loses power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR33.T;Reunification of the Western Host;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.D;The Western Cossacks had been united in a single host before the Polish forcefully separated the lands between the Dnieper and Zaporizhian hosts. Now is the time to end the pesky southern host and unify Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.A;For Cossack unity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.T;Securing the Donets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR34.D;The Donets basin was settled by independent Cossacks in the Departure Era, and has many times been threatened by the heathen Crimean sultanate. We have the duty to protect them from the Muslims and secure these vital black lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.A;For Cossack victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.T;Ending the Northern lapdogs;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.D;The Don Cossacks pledged themselves to the Princedom of Ryazan long ago and their new independence still is plagued by the influence of their boyars. We must strike against them to secure a strong and pure Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.A;For Cossack purity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.T;Failure of Sternenko;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.D;The ambitions of the Hetman were ended as he suffered defeat in his unification wars. His opponents profited from this to convene a new Rada and end his Hetmanate, leaving him to flee for his life abroad. Now the Ukrainian plains return to peace and their old ways of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.A;Defeat means peace at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR37.T;Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.D;At last, Ukraine has been united under the protection of Sternenko and his valorous soldiers. But now is the time for ruling. Already over the course of his campaigns, Sternenko made several laws modernizing the Host and turning into a real state like the rest of the West. Lingering Cossack influences have already hindered his efforts, but it seems that Ukraine’s future as a united polity is secure. But many wonder what this state will be : Sternenko has harboured some ambitions for his office to become hereditary and thus make Ukraine a monarchy, but he has fought along many Republicans in his life and could give powers to a renewed Chorna Rada.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.A;A Cossack Republic is what we need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.B;The Hetman shall lead as our monarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.C;Nothing really needs to change;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR38.T;The Kazan threat;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.D;After taking back power from the hands of the Duma, Michael II set his eyes on his neighbor : the Khanate of Kazan. The Khanate has been declining for decades, and held only because of the help we provided in putting down the Chayka rebellion that saw slaves rebel all along the Volga and threatened to spill into the serfs of Ryazan. Now Michael II wants to erase this shameful past and secure his rule and glory by pushing the Khanate to the Volga. An extensive campaign of conquest cannot be undertaken with the threat of the other princedoms but the Ryazanian court thought that reducing Tartar territory could only be helpful in the troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.A;To the Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR38.B;We cannot risk it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR39.T;Volga-Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.D;Ryazan has begun to avenge its past of humiliations at the hands of the steppe demons. Ryazanian armies swept the hordes of Kazan to the other side of the Volga and lands are already put to culture while our boats roam the Volga. Michael II returned to Ryazan hailed by the population and it seems to many of his neighbors that Ryazan will be a tough opponent in any fight to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.A;All hail Michael !;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR40.T;Setback in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.D;The plans of the Prince did not guarantee victory. It seems the Tatars are far from being uncivilized savages as many assumed, and our soldiers learnt it as they were forced back to our lands. Many wonder how Michael II could recover from such a blow to his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.A;How could it happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.T;An unstable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.D;Uniting our people under one banner was easy, but making them accept that Ukraine needs to endure as a modern state for the Cossack spirit not to die has been harder. Many want to continue the lives of their forefathers as free men in the Dyke Pole with no state to watch them. The next Rada will be decisive for the future of Ukraine and its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Let us go back to the Hosts of yore !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Ukraine will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.T;The visit of John Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.D;A strange man has appeared in Kharkov the other day. Claiming to be the son of a rich industrialist from Scotland, John Carnegie has apparently embarked on a trip throughout Eastern Europe to see the fierce and independent spirit of the Eastern Slavs in the open steppe. A romantic at heart, he has spent days with various Cossack hosts inspecting our borders and our lands, always astonished by our ways of life and the wilderness of our lands. He has proposed a partnership with the industrial conglomerate of his father to help $THIS$ develop although it will surely take years to be realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.A;A most peculiar visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.T;The creation of Karnegove;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.D;Following his last visit, John Carnegie has lobbied several bankers and fellow industrials to support his endeavors in our lands. Securing a large capital, he came back to Ukraine with the goal of building a metalwork factory in the Donbass where the abundance of coal is notorious. Our council of state has made him an honorary citizen of Ukraine and the town that sprung up around him was soon called 'Karnegove'. There, the finest steel of the East is produced and fuels a nascent industrialization of our nation. Carnegie has organized the factory on a 'socialist' model with schools and housing for his employees, hoping to create a perfect society in the middle of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.A;Steel makes us stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.T;The Donbass boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.D;The whole Donets basin is filled with coal and iron making it a natural area for industrialization to launch. Following the establishment of Karnegove several of the Cossack leaders have assembled in companies to exploit the riches of the Donbass, as foreign banks heavily invested in what many deem the 'best investment' there is right now in Europe. Many Cossacks have thus abandoned their small farms for the halls of the factories and the coal pits, ensuring the wealth of Ukraine and a rising standard of living throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.A;Let us all profit from this boom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.T;The lamentations of Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.D;Few news have reached us from the manor of Karnegove where the founder of the city has secluded himself for months. A mystical man at heart, he blames himself for the transformations of Ukraine and its people. His last speech to his employees  was written down by a journalist : 'Black smoke rises from the Ukrainian factories as it does in Scotland. Countless children are sacrificed in the pits or the factories where they once benefited from a humble but pure life in the Wild Fields...' He went on and on for nearly an hour before collapsing. The transformation is real, but at least his model factory continues to be a beacon of hope for many workers of the Donbass who crave the same housing and education provided in Karnegove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.A;A strange end for the Steelman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.T;Opening of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.D;"Rada" usually referred to an assembly of Cossack commanders, which were convened by the hetmans to resolve disputed issues. This time, however, the Rada looks quite different. At the Rada, which determines the structure and life of the unified Cossack state, absolutely everyone is allowed in, even ordinary soldiers, and they are given the same right to vote as the most influential commanders. Such an approach has increased the legitimacy of Ukraine and its Hetman, who is now respected by all parts of the Cossacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR46.A;Our fate is in our own hands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.T;Question of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.D;Despite the fact that Ukraine is considered a free land, in some Cossack hosts there is a wide layer of debt slaves and landless peasants who "voluntarily" work for the landowners. A large number of common Cossacks support the abolition of this system and the establishment of fair pay for all throughout Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.A;Serfdom in Ukraine? No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.B;We can't just abolish our customs...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.T;Question of State;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.D;The problem of host autonomy is perhaps the most pressing issue at this Rada. Despite the fact that the lands of Ukraine have been conquered by its unifier, local elites still count on some degree of autonomy. Will Ukraine be a centralized state, or a confederation of different regions, troops, and cities?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.A;The modern state have to be centralized!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.B;Confederation? Where have I heard that word before...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.T;Question of Military;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.D;At this point, our military forces are more like large bands than a regular army. Despite their combat effectiveness, Cossack military tactics are not formalized, and the creation of Western-style officer academies has not been successful. Few understand the need for modernization, and it is unclear whether their arguments will convince their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.A;United army for a united nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.B;No need to rush...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.T;Question of Voting rights;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.D;The Cossacks have a long tradition of collective decision-making. Often, even officers were elected from among the most respected soldiers, even if they were not the most competent tacticians and strategists... Obviously, the government in Ukraine will be elective, but the question is, who will elect it? It is clear to every Cossack that only the one holding a weapon in his hand has the right to choose, but the few liberals among the Cossack elite propose to give the right to vote to every man in Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.A;A voting citizen is a happy citizen.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.B;The right to vote has to be earned;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.T;Question of Hetman;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.D;The question of hetman rule had long been on the agenda. Not everyone likes the fact that a man once elected can count on power for the rest of his life, even if he no longer deserves it. A proposal was made to elect a hetman every few years, so that it would be clear that we are ruled by the most worthy one at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.A;Cossack Monarchy is our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.B;Long live the Cossack Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.T;Success of the Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.D;Despite the squabbles and arguments, those present at the Rada were still able to come to an agreement. The written Constitution of Ukraine will become the basis of our state and a symbol of unity of the Cossack people, which happened for the first time in 200 years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.T;Failure of the Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.D;Despite our seeming success in unifying Ukraine, we were unable to impose our will on the rest of the hosts. The draft Constitution of Ukraine, proposed by the Hetman, was a dismal failure, destroying his authority in the eyes of even his closest supporters. Various influential figures are already declaring themselves hetmans and restoring their independence, and it is up to us whether this process will be peaceful or whether we will once again show our strength and bring our enemies to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.A;A dream of Ukraine is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.B;To arms, khloptsi!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.T;Collapse of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.D;The situation at the Rada has heated up to the limit. Grouped into small parties, the Cossack elite and its subordinates cannot agree on a single issue. The word of the Hetman decides nothing, and no one listens to his opinion anymore. The elite accuses him of letting the "mob" into the Rada, while ordinary Cossacks blame him for compromises and his inability to demonstrate his leadership, for which he was loved by the soldiers. Delegations leave the Rada, and it has become clear to everyone that it is impossible to unite Ukraine by force of words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.T;Victory over separatists;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.D;Despite the fact that the starting situation in this civil war seemed deplorable, we were able to subdue all the rebellious areas and establish our authority there. Now that we have no serious political opponents left, we can implement our vision for the future of Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR56.T;Ruina;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.D;The war has exhausted the resources of all sides. We could not defeat the separatists, which means that dreams of a united Ukraine have been postponed for several more decades, if not forever. Weakened and divided, the land of the Cossacks is now open to conquest from all sides...;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.A;What have we done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
##################### Malta Stuff (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MLT1.T;An old and sick Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.D;The Order of Saint John has settled in Malta back in 1573, liberating the land from the Ottoman corsairs that had settled there. Our legacy endures but right now the current Grandmaster, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval would take advantage of this state to call a new election. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, Pons De Margarit de Biure, Montfort-Laval and his supporters will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean, although the Plantagenet king is already the official patron of the order. For the moment, the island is calm but who knows for how long ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.A;Trouble is brewing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.T;The Grandmaster of Malta ill;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.D;News have reached the European court that the current Grandmaster of the order of Saint John, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval has expressed that he wanted to take advantage of this state to call a new election, considering Cheschi unfit to maintain his power. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, he will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.A;How will it play ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.T;Death of the Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.A;Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose our loyal supporter, Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.A;A most auspicious news !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose the Aragonese Pons de Margarit de Biure, to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century. Jean de Montfort-Laval's influence has plummeted over the years and the man could do nothing against this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.A;A failed opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.T;Change in Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.D;The crown of Aragon has been the feudal overlord of the Order because the island belonged to the crown of Sicily before the Alfonsine concession of 1579. But now Aragon has lost the island and many wonder what it entails for Malta. Several groups have agitated in the previous days : the Knights are commonly hated by the population and many wish to throw them out the island for good. Among these factions many Irrendentists wish the island to join with their Italian brothers in Sicily. But in the end the Knights still possess the artillery and weapons and could try to crush this uprising. Who shall dictate the path of Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.A;The independent Republic of Malta!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.B;Malta must embrace the Italian cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.C;Knights hold out and declare sovereignity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.T;A Republic in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.D;Following our loss of the Sicilian island the Knights of Malta were ousted from the island by a popular uprising who declared an independant Republic, breaking all ties they had with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.A;An independant Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.T;An envoy from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.D;Following our victory over the Aragonese Crown, the citizens of Malta ended the rule of the Knights over them and have now declared their intention to join our state !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.A;Viva $COUNTRY$ !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.T;Malta joins Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.D;Following our defeat in Sicily, the Maltese crowds soon ousted the Knights and declared their intention to join those who now occupy the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.A;The nail in the coffin...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.T;Independence of the Order;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.D;With our loss of the island of Sicily, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John has proclaimed that he did not have to honour the old contract that binded the order with our Crown and proclaimed the independence of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.A;But ... the Alfonsine concession ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.T;The Maltese uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.D;The hold on the Knights grew weaker over the years as the newfound independence gave several ideas to the Maltese intellectuals who already hated the Knights when they were just 'Aragonese lapdogs'. Following several economic crises and scandals involving Knights and especially the head of the English tongue, the Nationalists decided to organize a demonstration in the capital of Porto Ferrante. From there Ugo Buhagiar, leader of the Nationalists tried to lead his supporters to take the Palace of the Grandmaster and proclaim the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.A;The Grandmaster is toppled : long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.B;The crowd is dispersed by the Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.T;A meeting in Marseilles;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.D;Jean de Montfort-Laval was never meant to become a Knight. The first heir of one of the greatest noble families of the Kingdom, he had to flee and become a Knight following a duel provoked by a remark of the poet Maurice de la Rochefoucauld over his sister. Arriving in Malta at the age of 21 he soon used his prestige and charisma to climb the levels of the order and become the second most powerful man in Malta. With our conquest of the Valois duchy, he has come on an embassy to negotiate officially the status of the Provence tongue possessions in our Kingdom. But in private he has asked for the support of the Rex Christianissimus, should the Grandmaster step down, and promised us to become our foremost ally in the Mediteranean. His ambitions may be high, but Malta could be used as a friendly base on the road to the Levant and would foremost lower the power of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.A;The Pact of Marseilles is signed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.T;The Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT13.D;For years, the young head of the Auvergne tongue, Jean de Montfort-Laval has criticized the current Grandmaster for holding on to power while his life resumes to lying in bed or visiting sanatoriums. The pressure has been high for Pietro Cheschi who finally decided to abdicate following the latest attacks in the Holy Council. A new election is to be called to select the 75th Grandmaster and it will surely be a contentious one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.A;Let us thanks Pietro Cheschi for his service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.T;Abdication of Pietro Cheschi;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT14.D;The Grandmaster of the order of Malta has abdicated because of his bad health. At least that's the official version : the head of the Aragonese tongue has contacted us to inform us of the latest maneuvers of the Dual-Monarchy, patron of the Order since the XVIIth century and which currently supports the young Jean de Montfort-Laval. Our ambassadors fear that they may try to place their puppet to increase their influence and make the island their possession and not ours. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.A;The election is a game we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.T;A contentious election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT15.D;The election of the 75th Grandmaster is contentious. Montfort-Laval hoped to win the election without any problems, but his influence is as high as the hatred and contempt he inspires many of his brothers. The head of the German tongue, Karl Von Preysling, has even retired to the German inn in the port, refusing to take part in the process because of the irregularities he has witnessed. For now the election is thus blocked...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.A;Such infighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.T;News from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT16.D;As the prime Catholic nation of Europe, we have an interest in the direction of the Order of Saint John in Malta, with most of the German knights hailing from our country or our allies. The Apostolic legate in Prague has contacted us because the head of the German tongue (administrative division of the order) in Malta, Karl von Preysling is blocking the election process of the Grandmaster because of his personal hatred of the main candidate Jean de Montfort-Laval. We exert a lot of influence amongst the German brothers and could force Von Preysling to come back to the table of negotiations. The Pope has informed us that the rivalry between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy is a great concern : we could push Von Preysling to make a bid to become Grandmaster and establish a new relation of the Order with his patrons, or we could just instruct him to end the election as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.A;The Kaiser wants Von Preysling to become Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.B;The Kaiser just wants the end of this political drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interference;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT17.D;The election is not as smooth as Monfort promised us. He has been challenged because of his youth and of several rivalries he made since his arrivals. Among these, the offended Karl von Preysling has recently come back to the Holy Council for the election, proposing himself as a neutral and peaceful choice for Grandmaster. We had heard of the interest of the Prague court in these matters but we did not envision they would use their influence for such a thing. Several Italian knights have joined Von Preysling because of Papal manipulations and we are now forced to demand Spain to put pressure on their knights in the Portuguese and Castilian tongues to ensure that our investment in Montfort-Laval succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.A;Contact the Spanish ambassador, they will feel important for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.T;A demand from Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT18.D;The Order of Saint John has convened for a new election following the retirement of the previous Grandmaster. Our influence there is not so strong with the Spanish knights representing a fringe minority in the ranks of the Order but as the election grows more decisive the Anglois choice of Jean de Montfort-Laval faces increased competition. The head of the Spanish knights, Pedro de Olivares has yet to pronounce his judgement and our friends in Paris have asked us for our support. Supporting them is the best course of action since it will surely weaken Aragon while enhancing our position in European diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.A;Contact Olivares, he has a favour to honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.T;Ending the stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT19.D;Factionalism has grown over the previous weeks as European diplomats sent various messages to Malta to instruct the Knights from the wishes of the sovereigns of their homelands. 3 candidates are still in the competition : Jean de Montfort-Laval's ambitions are still strong and he hopes to end the current situation of the Order with Aragon thanks to the protection of Paris counting on the support of most of the Anglois and Spanish knights. On the other hand Pons Margarit de Biure proclaims that he is a traitor and can count on the votes of the Aragonese knights. Meanwhile Karl von Preysling has come back, promoting himself as a compromise candidate, who with the backing of the Papacy and the Emperor in Prague wishes to affirm neutrality from both Aragon and Dual-Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.A;Karl von Preysling becomes the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.B;Monfort-Laval wins despite all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.C;Margarit de Biure confirms the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.T;A new situation in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT20.D;Our candidate in the election has lost but at least the Anglois Montfort did as well! The new German knight has the support of Prague and also Rome, as the Holy Father has been angered by the various intrigues that plagued the succession of Pietro Cheschi. The Apostolic legate has thus drafted a plan that would see our feudal contract ended with the Order while making sure that the archipelago would not be used by a foreign power against us, notably the Dual-Monarchy. With the intervention of the Pope it seems hard to go against this situation and Malta isn't really worth the hassle after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.B;We don't accept the Convention!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.T;The Convention of Porto Ferrante;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT21.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, he asked the Aragonese King to change the feudal contract that binded the Order to the King of Sicily by assuming neutrality in the Mediteranean. Following the vicious infighting that the election caused, this solution was supported by the Curia who had sent the first draft to Barcelona about this new situation. Malta would be ceded to the Order in full, with the Knights promising to observe neutrality outside of their protection duties. The Convention was then signed in Porto Ferrante by both representatives from the Anglois and Aragonese Kings, leading to the end of their relationships with the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.A;The Knights protect the island and nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.T;The Maltese Falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT22.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling received a letter of thanks for his support along with a magnificent Maltese Falcon. The bird had been the symbol of the feudal relationship between the Order and Barcelona and Karl von Preysling had decided that it was only fitting that his Imperial Majesty received the last of these gifts. The animal would be given to Princess Elisabeth, the first born of the Emperor who would begin a tradition of hunting with only Maltese falcons. Along with her other eccentricities, the bird would become a symbol, many of the Bohemian Imperial family members being painted or later taking photos of them with these Falcons, often nicknamed the 'Imperial Falcon'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.A;The Bohemian Eagle deserves such a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.T;Election of Montfort-Laval;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT23.D;What we feared happen, the Anglois protégé and ambitious knight, Jean de Montfort-Laval was elected by the Holy Council to lead the Order. For now he has publicly sent us our Maltese Falcon as a sign of his submission to the current agreements between the Order and our sovereign but behind closed doors, it is no secret that he dreams of an independent Malta, with him girdling a Crown...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.A;We will have to watch him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.T;An ally in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT24.D;Our ally, Jean de Montfort-Laval has won the election in Malta. In a secret letter to our goverment he has assured us that he will move quite soon against the current status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.A;New opportunites arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.T;The Grand-principality of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT25.D;The Order of Saint-John has been criticzed for decades about his general lack of utility in the modern world. With piracy in the Mediteranean ended, they have been left without a cause and hated by the general population of the archipelago because of the heavy taxation. The latest Grandmaster, Jean de Montfort-Laval took advantage of this situation to coup the Holy Council, the administrative head of the Order by declaring himself Grand-Prince of Malta, and nationalising the Order, while allowing the Knights who swore fealty to him to remain. He then promulgated a charter to associate the Maltese elites, making him vastly popular on the islands. Now, even with the Anglois protection he must face the Aragonese who are still the de jure masters of the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.A;Long live our Prince !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.T;A prince in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT26.D;The proclamation of the Grandmaster as Prince of Malta and the nationalisation of the order surprised many despite the knowledge that he was up to some scheme. But now we are faced with a dilemma : either we recognize the actions of 'John I' of Malta and his independence or we will have to fight the Dual-Monarchy who has already recognized the new monarch of the islands. Is Malta really worth a war with the greatest power of Europe ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.A;Recognize his independence, he only rules three worthless rocks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.B;The archipelago is a possession of the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.T;Safe from Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT27.D;The gamble from the Prince had worked : Aragon forfeited its claims over our archipelago, fearful of the protection from our friends in Paris. It is a new era for Malta, which is now independent. To celebrate this, John I decided to sail back to his homeland to thank the Anglois court for their support (and secure a wedding prospect now that he had been liberated from his vows), and upholding his promise of being a trusted ally in the Mediteranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.A;All is calm in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.T;The election of Pons Margarit de Biure;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.D;Pons Margarit de Biure, head of the Aragonese tongue of the Knights of Saint John has been elected Grandmaster of the Order. This news was met with joy in Barcelona given that he was the candidate of the King and the only one who supported the current relationship Malta has with the Crown. He also has opposed the Anglois interests in the islands, denouncing in particular Jean de Montfort-Laval who was accused of treason and thrown into prison following the discovery of several letters indicating his plots against the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MLT29.T;The election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.D;Karl von Preysling has finally come back to his senses, announcing his support of Margarit de Biure against Jean de Montfort-Laval. With the German knights denouncing him along with a general lack of support from most of the various tongues, the chances of Montfort being elected have quite faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MLT30.D;The new prince of Malta has come to Paris following the celebrations of the new Maltese independence and the general reorganization of the state. As he is welcomed by the King, ministers discuss the new alliance between the archipelago and the Dual-Monarchy, securing the use of the naval bases in times of peace and war. Anglois capitalists discuss the opening of this new market while the Prince announced his marriage to the third removed cousin of the King, the duchess of Longueville. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##################### Synøe Events (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.T;The Pearl of the Antilles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.D;The Southern Islands, or as we call them the Synøe, are the pride of the Scandinavian colonial empire. The archipelago comprised of the main island of Kiskøyene and the secondary island of Righavn, is one of the main sources of colonial products be it sugar, coffee or chocolate. The slave population far surpasses the local settlers who come mainly from Scandinavia although many of the lower classes trace their ancestry to some Scottish clans deported them for their support during the Anglois occupation in the XVIIIth century. This pearl of the Antilles relies on slavery and we are sure to hear the settlers demand concessions if we were to abolish this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.A;It's not on the agenda, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.T;The Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.D;The law outlawing slavery has passed following a growth of Liberal thought in our country. But in the Caribbean this Act of the Rigsdag has seen wide condemnation from the settlers who condemn idealists knowing nothing of their lives and the benefits of slavery. They demand that the state assumes the financial loss they have to suffer because of the Act, a compromise many Liberals accept because of the infringment on private property this Act represents.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.A;We will pay for the emancipation of their slaves. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.B;Paying for having freed men, what nonsense is this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.T;The Kiskøyener Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.D;Pamphlets and slogans flourish in the Caribbean against Scandinavian rule following the refusal of Copenhagen to consider the side of the Kiskøyener planters. For many this is another sign that the relationship with the metropolis must end, as the island has no representation in Parliament and must always abide to the laws dictated by men who know nothing of the life in the Southern Islands. The Kiskøyener manifesto from Peter MacKristian is the most known of these works, and has become the main subject of conversation amongst the White population.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.A;They are just a colony, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.T;The independence of the Republic of Kiskøyene;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.D;As the situation of our state grew dire in the Antilles and abroad, the resistance against our rule increased. In these new circumstances, the old Planter elite along with the rest of the population declared the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, throwing away the representatives of Copenhagen and cutting ties with the metropolis.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.A;These islands were a burden anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.B;We will reconquer the Synøe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.T;The new Kiskøyener movement;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.D;In the last decades of the XIXth century, the islands of Sydøen experienced a national awakening. Distance from the motherland along with a difference in climate and general society had always made the Creole natives wary of the 'Northern' administrators. But the abolition of slavery led to a greater miscegenation among the lower classes, and the growing sentiment that the various populations, in all their differences, from the 'pure' Scandinavian Creole planters, to the mixed lower classes born from the mixing of Highlanders, Danish sailors and African slaves, had a common destiny and formed one nation. From autonomists to nationalists, all clamour for a new relationship with Scandinavia, which should hear them if it doesn't want conflict to erupt on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.A;Sydøen or Kiskøyene, call it as you want!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.T;The Sydøen dominion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.D;Demands of autonomy have grown over the years in our Antillean colonies, their people demanding a new relationship with the metropolis. As their societies developed and grew, it seemed inevitable to many that the Scandinavian government would have to grant them some power. It seems the easier way to maintain our control over these islands would be to associate them as a Dominion of the Crown, with their diplomacy aligned with the decisions in Copenhagen while leaving them masters of their economy, health and education. We could refuse that deal, but it would bolster the nationalist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.A;We welcome the new dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.B;They are not developed enough for that.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.C;We welcome the new dominion ! (play as them);;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.T;Competition in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.D;The rise of the New World powers has been a great concern for Scandinavia in the later years. Many Kiskøyener nationalists created exiled networks in these countries, rising public opinion against us. Then, they started coming back, harrassing the colonial police over the previous weeks. Now the situation has grown dire, with most of our forces in the islands trapped by the nationalists who proclaimed the independent United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, waiting for their benefactor to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.T;Fight for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.D;The day has come! We will not let the Scandinavian oppress us anymore, it is time to rise up or die free!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.A;Liberty or Death!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.T;A Contact from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.D;The inhabitants of the islands of Kiskøyene and Righavn have risen up against the Scandinavian oppressor and demand our help. For several years we hosted exiles and trained some of their men in hope to reduce European influence in the Caribbean, now is the time!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.A;Europeans must go back to Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.B;It is better not to provoke them...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which have already declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.A;Our Navy will sail the Atlantic to end this petty republic.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.B;Let it go...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.D;The pathetic attempts of the Sydøer to gain the support of the powers of the New World have failed. They stand alone agains the might of Scandinavia and it will be easy for our Navy to end their dreams of independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.A;Let us sail for the Sydøen!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.B;Perhaps we should let them alone ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.T;Scandinavian decline;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.D;As Scandinavian power declined on the world stage over the years, the hopes of the nationalists in Sydøen rose. Our might is not what it was, and the locals saw it as less ships and colonial forces were put in the islands. In this situation, the nationalists gathered over the previous weeks, harassing local police forces and soldiers. Yesterday they felt strong enough to storm the palace of the governor and declare the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.A;It can't end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.T;The reconquest of the Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which might have declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.A;Weigh, me boys, to Sydoe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.B;We better not ...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.T;Suðurhafseyjar;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.D;Published in $YEAR$, the book 'The South Sea Islands' from Hans Johannesson was soon recognized as a monument of Icelandic litterature, and following his translation of the whole Scandinavian literature. Inspired by the life of the author who himself lived several years in the colony of Sydøen, the book describes the travels of a poor Icelandic, Sigurd Hansson. Following the deaths of his mother and sister he is forced to leave his homeland because of the misery he lives in. Arriving in Righavn he relates the beauty of this exotic land, only to witness the darker side of the Sydøen society : while slavery is abolished, the narrator witnesses the violence of the old masters on their freed workers and how Afro-Kiskøyener are only second-class citizens in the islands. Eventually the story ends on a note of hope, the Icelandic finding happiness after settling in a small village of the Kiskøyene interior with his wife. While praised for its literary quality by the various literary critics of Copenhagen and beyond, the book was also vividly criticized by Kiskøyener for his critics of their society along with the end chapter implying that the narrator marries a Black woman. Nonetheless, the attention the book received made the Synoe colony widely known as the 'Suðurhafseyjar' in the rest of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Neo-Guelphist solution proposes that Italy be organized as a loose confederation headed by the Pope, which would respect the various laws of the provinces that would join while still forming a united Italian polity.

TUS1.T;The Buonaparte Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.D;The proclamation of the duchy of Genoa by the former Doge Lodovico Della Rovere was not accepted by all in the Republic. Troubles brewed in Corsica for the past years, the island being notoriously hard to administer for the Ligurians. Eventually, the chief of the garrison of the island, Pietro Buonaparte declared that the Duke was an usurpator and that no Corsican would bow to the whims of a monarch. Without a fight, the various soldiers scattered around the island surrendered as Buonaparte was proclaimed Dictator of the Corsican Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.A;A rebellious island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.T;The Republican threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.D;The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the ending of the Genoan republic that had existed for centuries and was done thanks to his grip over the army. But lately his autocratic rule has alienated him several officers and throughout Liguria many resent him from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. With the Buonaparte insurrection in Corsica, some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some supports and is well prepared to face his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.A;The rebellion is crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.B;Lodovico I flees the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.T;Savoy and Genoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.D;The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows little signs of wanting to fight for his former title. For the court of our Duke, it is a wonderful opportunity : Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly- lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.A;The Duke of Savoy is the rightful Duke of Liguria:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.B;It isn't worth the cost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.T;Stabilization of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.D;Overthrowing the tyran Della Rovere did not bring a peaceful restoration of the old order. Patricians squabbled among themselves for political positions while the Duke of Savoy gathered armies on the border. But in the end all was resolved when the Dictator of Corsica, Pietro Buonaparte accepted the office of Doge and brought back the island into the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.A;La Superba will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.T;The matter of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.D;Politics of Etruria have been growing more and more polarized after the revolutionary support for the short-lived Sicilian Republic ended in failure. Conservatives have taken back the upper hand in the legislature and government but Liberals still exert a vast influence. With the Corsican revolt ending the tyranny of Lodovico Della Rovere, many Republicans hoped that he would grant more liberties to the Corsican people. But eventually, Buonaparte ended ruling with an iron fist over the island, while members of the Society of the Commons were declared bandits and outlaws. Now the Republic must decide to either support the 'Protector of Corsica' who is still an ardent Republican, or support the underground factions of the Commons. His rule is far from assured and a few weapons and official support could easily lead to a popular uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.A;Stability is paramount : support Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.B;A republic without freedom means nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.T;The deposition of Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.D;After months of local infighting between the supporters of Buonaparte and the popular movements, Etruria finally offered her support to the Commons. A Tuscan ship boarded the Eastern Coast, supplying Antonio Paoli, former officer under Buonaparte, weapons to act. His partisans crossed the maquis and finally arrived in Corte where Buonaparte had established his government. The fighting was swift as partisans attacked the city from all sides, with Buonaparte surrendering mere minutes after the beginning of the attack. The manifesto of the Commons was soon printed en masse and shared throughout the island with the various villages and families of Corsica rejoicing over the new state of affairs. The first action of the Paoli government was to proclaim an alliance with Etruria and vowing to help in the overthrow of the Old order in Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.A;Viva Corsica!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.T;Revolution in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.D;Following the official support of the Etrurian republic for the Commons in Corsica, weapons were given to the leader of the resistance Antonio Paoli who then took nearly without any blood spilled the city of Corte where the government was hosted. A democratic Republic has been established in Corsica and Buonaparte will face a trial for his crimes agains the people. Paoli has pledged to support us in any endeavours we may face against the Reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.A;Now Corsica, soon all of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.T;The election of 1838;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.D;The Etrurian Republic has been experimenting a Byzantine system of government whose all goal is to prevent the rise of either Reactionaries or Radical Revolutionaries to power. The Republic is ruled through Councils that choose various the ministers and consuls of the Republic. Among the various councils the most important is the 200 Council, which is partially elected every 3 years, with one third of the seats to be filled in the coming election. The current legislature is divided, and despite the censitary vote in effect, the Republicans have a great chance at gaining a large majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.A;Who will win ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.D;After the votes were counted the 200 Council saw a Moderate majority seated. Among the members of the Society of the Commons, rumors spread of a plot to extinguish the Revolutionary flame once and for all by confiscating the election. The people was soon in arms in Florence, while soldiers were divided on how to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.A;The people end the Moderate governement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.B;The army sides with the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.D;The Republicans ended up winning the election, notably thanks to the vote of the soldiers, exempted from having to require to pay taxes to vote. But the Moderate Consuls did not intent to let the Republicans take power in the Republic. They soon called upon the army to storm the Parliament and arrest Republicans. Street fights were undecisive as many soldiers preferred to side with the popular movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.A;The Moderates restore Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.B;The Republicans crush the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is a threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our rights to the grand duchy of Tuscany. Medicis have ruled the city of Florence for 4 centuries and it is time we renew with this tradition. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power. It would be a perfect occasion as the Republic is currenty divided and the rebels squabbling among themselves. What do we choose ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.A;Nous reprendrons nos droits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.B;Le risque est trop grand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUS11.T;A stable Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.D;The Revolution has now ended. For too many years, Liberals and secret societies seeked to embroil Etruria once again in war against our Holy Faith and the various monarchs of the peninsula. While it is true that overthrowing the Old Order was justified we must take a diplomatic stance rather than risk a war we cannot win. Etruria will thus abandon the violence of the past years but not the Italian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.A;Nessuna rivoluzione ma nessun Antico Regime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.T;A revolutionary Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.D;The Revolution has been hampered for too many years by the Moderate efforts to acquire 'normalized relations' with the reactionary states that surround us which only paved the way for the Provencal attempt to restore the Antico Regime. The people has been heard, and the Etrurian Republic will not stop until all Italy is liberated from its oppresive monarchs and foreign tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.A;Unione Forza e Liberta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.T;An opportunity in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.D;The current attempt of the Duke of Provence to reclaim Tuscany allows us to more easily take Corsica, which is a rightful part of the Duchy of Genoa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.A;The island will accept its new master by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.B;What could we do with Corsica ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.T;Reclaiming Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.D;The duchy of Lucca is an artificial construction of the partisans of the Antico Regime. Following the peace of Lucca of 1814 the Gonzaga of Milan organized the creation of a monarchist state in Lucca and also encompassing the former duchy of Massa with Jean of Valois-Forcalquier, cousin of the King in France, proclaimed monarch of this petty state. His daughter Marguerite who succeeded him in 1827 enjoys little sympathy from the population and it will not be hard for our armies to bring back the Revolution to these territories:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.A;Lucca is Etrurian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.T;Ending the Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.D;Following the foolish attempt of Alessandro IV of Parma to establish a Constitutional Kingdom of Italy in the 1820's, his domains were split between his cousins Alessandro V in Parma and Ferdinando in Modena. Both claim the duchy of Massa from Lucca and have sent demands of aid to all the other monarchs in Italy, or so our spy networks tell us. We must end these petty duchies and united the people of Emilia in our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.A;Onwards to Parma and Modena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.T;The Romagnol uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.D;Romagna was the second centre of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of Bologna had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, the order came back to Romagna and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors from the oldest university of Europe. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. But with our brothers in Tuscany having rekindled the flame of liberty, secret societies in Bologna have risen the tricolor and the Papal officials were forced to flee as the revolutionaries decided to join with Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.A;Italia unita !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.T;Romagna joins us !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.D;Our success in Italy and our support for revolutionaries has rekindled the revolutionary fervour in Romagna. From the Liberal bastion of Bologna, where many of our leaders have been formed, the Patriots rose against the Papal garrison and agents who were thrown out. Then the Bologna assembly decided to join back Etruria to advance the National and Revolutionary cause. While an interesting prospect for us, it also enraged the Papacy who consider that we have invaded their territory. We might soon hear from Aragonese threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.A;Viva Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.T;Loss of Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.D;Romagna has risen against our power and pledged itself to the heathen radicals of Etruria. Always a hotbed of radicalism and agitation, it seems our rule through the use of the Inquisition alienated the good people of Romagna. The Papal army is weak, and Etruria has engineered many plots over the years so the Curia is weary of trying to fight them. We will wait for our Aragonese protectors to help us in that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.A;The Church has endured for centuries, we can endure such a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.T;Commons in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.D;Memories from the 1827 and 1828 uprising that saw the creation of the Neapolitan and Sicilian Republics are still vividly remembered in our Republic along with the restoration of order that followed by the tyrannous Catalans. All revolutionaries know it : the main menace for the Republic comes from Barcelona for it is because of Barcelona that the Pope still reigns with an iron fist over Central Italy. With our success in restoring Republican rule over Central Italy, the networks of the Commons Societies in Southern Italy have gathered again. We could begin help them organize so that they would rise should Aragon decide to try to end the Revolution. However such a move would be hard to hide from Catalan spies and could give further reasons to the Catalans to attack us ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.A;Il suon d'ogni squilla i Vespri suonò!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.B;We have learnt from 1828, leave the Southern peasants on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.T;The second Italian Coalition war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.D;As many aristocrats and conservatives flock into Naples, we are forced to admit that the old Revolutionary threat in Tuscany has grown again and threatens our hegemony. We must gather our forces and restore order to Northern Italy lest we see the Green-White-Red tricolour fly over Rome, Naples and Palermo! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.A;God is with us in this holy war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.B;We can’t risk our holdings…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.T;The Second Parthonepean Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.D;Our attack against Tuscany has rallied the unruly crowds of Napoli who have risen once again against our rule. Hopefully their rule does not extend over the whole South given their opposition to Santamarians, but they can still pose a threat to our current war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.A;End this petty ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.T;The Napolitan and Sicilian uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.D;Etrurian agents had been plotting against us for years and they had sent agents to Napoli and Sicily to create a network of informants and rebels they could arm should we go to war with them. With our armies rallied to fight the Tuscan insurgents in the North, the Italian tricolour was flown over the citadel of Naples and much of Sicily, the revolutionaries hoping to win their freedom. Hopefully, we can squash these revolts again and teach the Southerners that Order is paramount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.A;We will win !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.T;Proposal of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.D;A proposal has come from the Republic of Etruria. Having abandoned their revolutionary heritage for reason, they have proposed a peaceful unification of the Peninsula in a weak confederation that would be headed by the Pope while preserving the rights of all members and its own laws. This could be an interesting proposal to end the bickering between Italian statelets and avoid a forceful unification like dreamed about by the Savoyards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.A;This is a very interesting proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.B;We are better off alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.C;This is a very interesting proposal (Switch to Tuscany);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.T;Formation of the Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.D;Italian nationalism has never really gone away despite the end of Revolution in Italy. As threats grow, the Pope, the Republic of Tuscany and Milano have decided to join in a Confederation that will be headed by his Holiness. The rights of all states adhering to the Confederation will be respected, with the Confederal government only in charge of war, trade and diplomacy. This Confederation is already very criticized, notably in Savoy who has been a prime opponent of the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TUS26.T;Crossing the Po;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.D;The Etrurian hydra roars again. Terrorists strike in all Italy while the barbarous legions of Florence have exiled the Farnese from their duchies. Leopoldo I stands ready to end the Etrurian menace once again as he did in his youths when hordes of peasants and atheists had taken the ancestral seat of his family in Mantua, and end once and for all the threat they pose to the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TUS28.A;With this, the Revolution grows stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.T;The Borgia charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.D;Following the victory over the Republic of Etruria, Duke Leopoldo was approached by his daughter-in-law Maria Borgia. She exposed that Italy could not continue to be divided into petty states. Milan having defeated Etruria was the prime pretender to the defunct Kingdom of Italy and it could only come if a Charter was drafted to ensure stability and lessen the threat of the Republicans. By abdicating, Leopoldo, already aged, could secure a swift succession that could realize this idea and fight for the rights of Maria to Southern Italy. But he could also hold onto power and try to unite Northern Italy in a neutral confederation with the Pope, as suggested by Neo-Guelphists...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.A;An Italian confederation will preserve stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.B;The Charter is the first step to a unified Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.T;Marianist insurrection in Naples!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.D;Following the promulgation of the so-called 'Borgia Charter' by the Duke of Milan, Maria Borgia headed to Naples to claim her lost crown. Supported by Marianist networks, the garrison was soon overwhelmed and she could enter the city with minimal resistance. With the fall of the city, the countryside followed as many lords changed allegiances and peasants joined the Marianist banditry. War will come soon to the Boot of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.A;If one abdication is not enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.T;The March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.D;The South has heard the call of her rightful sovereign as crowds gather to be armed and fight the Aragonese throughout the Kingdom of Naples. Between our current possessions and the South lie the prize of Italy, Rome still governed by the Church. The Pope has refused to grant us access, stating that Maria had no rights to Naples since her abdication. We have no choice but to declare war on the Papal State to make sure that the Marianists are not isolated in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.A;If we can take Rome in the process ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.T;The unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.D;When Maria Borja, queen of Aragon was deposed by Josep Serna in 1835 no one thought that she could become Queen again. The masses of the South rose to her call to fight Aragon. After a successful march on Rome she joined the armies of her husband Massimiliano Maria Visconti and managed to force Aragon to recognize her as the legitimate sovereign of Naples. With their victory over Etruria and the Aragonese, Massimiliano and Maria were eventually proclaimed the rightful sovereigns of Italy, despite the Pope, a mere puppet of Barcelona, refusing to accept this new order. Challenges await the Visconti-Borgia as Italy is yet to be completely united but crowds rejoice, for it has been centuries since the end of the Kingdom of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.A;Viva Massimiliano! Viva Maria ! Viva Italia ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.T;La Regina Margot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.D;The first representation of the new play of Dominico Rezzi, 'La Regina Margherita' was met with great acclaim in Milan. It retells the story of the Great Italian War (1539-1546) originating in the succession of Margherita I de Valois on the throne of Milan. Breaking with the classical rules, the play mixes tragical elements with grotesque scenes. The author notably represented the death of Francesco de Valois, duke of Milan during the Italian Wars, in an undignified manner that was criticized by many critics. The success of the play can be partially explained by the nationalist subtext : Margherita, the duchess of Milan must choose between a Borja and a Plantagenet to marry and her eventual wedding to the Dauphin is seen as the lesser of two evils both for her and for Italy. After a dozen of representations the play  was censored in the Duchy, the Duke consedering it a criticism of the future-Duchess Maria Borgia, .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.A;A shame our Duke dislikes good theatre...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.T;The Republican Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.D;Following a commission and gifts from all parts of the Republic, a new monument was unveiled in Florence. A statue was erected in honor of the Republican heroes Goffredo Baccarani and his wife Mariana Angeliotti. Baccarani secured the existence of the Republic in its first years and nearly managed to unify Northern Italy until he was shot in the leg and forced to retreat from the battlefields. His wife ruled the Republic in his absence through a network of yesmen allowing her to overcome the fact that women were not allowed to exercize charges. Even after the Moderate takeover of the Republic, Mariana continued to head the popular movements until she was shot by a priest in 1821. An immense crowd gathered to pay their respects to the Father and especially the Mother of the Republic, who now watch over the city from the hill of the Oltrarno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.A;Statues to honor Republicans not Tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.T;The Crown of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.D;The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja, which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples, his brother and heir Ferran VI, died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV, Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive, for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them, Milan may especially prove troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.T;The escape of Maria Borja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.D;Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan, Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples. While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy, she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions, the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. In the night of the 25th February 1837, she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria, heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.A;Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.T;Maria Borgia, future duchess of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.D;Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I, the prince of Legnano, in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes, with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri. Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General, Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke, Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon, as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo, the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily, so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.A;Maria will become Queen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.T;The House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.D;The house of Savoy is one of the mightiest houses of Italy. Ever since the XVIIth century, our power has grown in Italy proper while our Transalpine possessions becoming more of an afterthought. The conquest of Monferrato and Novara from the Duchy of Milan in the late XVIIIth century saw us put firmly in the Anglois sphere. To many in Turin it appears that we could leverage our Western possessions against military help to form a united Italy. At least, we will not bow down so easily to other would-be unifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.A;FERT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.T;Our chance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.D;The call to unity from Maria Borgia and the current war against Aragon appear to many officials as the perfect opportunity for our state to gain ascendency. But at the same time, this would alienate our friends in Paris which are still interested in our Savoyard possessions and we would be alone in this war. Let us backstab our rivals in Milan and become the true unifiers of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.A;To Milan and more !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.B;Now is not the right time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.T;Ending the Revolutionary threat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.D;The Etrurian republic which has been the greatest threat to stability and tradition in Italy in the recent past is now at war with the Aragonese Crown. We can’t let either win : Etruria securing its independence would inspire revolutionaries everywhere in Italy while Aragon restoring order would just hamper our claims to the old Kingdom of Italy. We must thus cross the border and attack the so called ‘heart of the Revolution’ and bring glory and unity to the peninsula. But at the same time, this would alienate us our friends in Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.A;We will end the ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.B;Let them fight, we can pick up the scraps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.T;The isolation of Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.D;Turin has profited from the current state of war between us and Central Italy to backstab our enemies and proclaim that they are the only worthy unifier of Italy. While it will make our war easier, we must profit from the opportunity to bring Piedmont under our domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.A;The house of Savoy must end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.B;We must focus on our current war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.T;Foreign Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.D;$THISCOUNTRY$ faces war as foreigners have crossed our borders and threaten to topple us. This has created a large surge of patriotism so our lands do not fall to foreign domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.A;For Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.T;The fate of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.D;With our influence secured in Savoy, our state can easily obtain their western territories on our side of the Alps in exchange for support in creating an Italian state. At the same time, some jingoists in our state recall that we could take opportunity of their relative weakness to crush the Savoyard state and annex it in its entirety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.A;Savoy is enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.B;We will cross the Alps as conquerors !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR7.B;Turin and Genoa are rightfully ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.T;The threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.D;With the house of Savoy under threat from invaders from beyond the Alps, the political climate in the Italian confederation has drastically changed. With their rivals from Turin not able to deny their legitimacy and the threat caused by the invasion, the Italian confederation has declared itself the rightful Italian state and has received the support of most of the Italian patriots in doing so. The squabbles between the various members have also been put aside, creating a federal government with far more prerogatives than the old Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.A;Avanti Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$’s proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.D;$ FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials have proposed us their help in the unification of Italy under our state in exchange for the promise of our Savoyard possessions. It is true that our state was created in the Alpine valleys and that the royal house is known as the house of Savoy. But these are rural and enclaved lands, and not many want to keep them when we can easily trade them for the whole peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.A;If they honor the deal, we will give them Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.B;We can’t renounce the lands of our ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ accepted !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted to let go of the Alps in exchange for our military aid against the Italian confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.A;A good trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.D;Following agreements between the house of Savoy and $FROMCOUNTRY$, the government of $THISCOUNTRY$ has declared war on the weak Italian confederation, proclaiming that Italy needs a strong and united government rather than the mess that the Compromesso created. It is a war opposing Italian against Italian, with the support of foreigners, and whatever the end, it will change Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.A;Let us hope for the better…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.T;A Geographical Construct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.D;Italy has been ‘united’ by $FROMCOUNTRY$. A weak puppet state only controlling Northern Italy, not even Rome, this new state has already been heavily criticized by the Italian patriots who see it only as the result of another foreign imperialist. While it appeared to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government as the best option to stabilize Italy, this may lead to a renewed era of instability from the various groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.A;At least there is an Italy I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.T;Il Compromesso;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.D;The Italian Confederation is a loose compromise between the various powers of Central Italy. It satisfies no one, and few people consider it the rightful Italian state. Unless the state can assert itself in the coming years, it may easily fall to infighting and instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.A;We will unite Italy nonetheless !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful. Nonetheless, our old rival in Turin, propped up by foreign powers, has apparently decided to approach the Confederation for a proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.A;It is strange …;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful.

SAR15.A;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.T;Approaching the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.D;The Confederation while weak is still the main contender to the unification of Italy. With no strong foreign support for our cause, we have stood as rivals for decades without any particular change to the global situation. With critics accumulating of the Confederation, it seems to many officials that it would be the right time to join it, and use our influence and might to appoint our government and unite Italy. But at the same time, it is a risky move, and we could let the Confederation fail and dissolve on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.A;Integrate the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.B;Integrate the Confederation (player only);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.C;Better to let it fall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.T;The new Savoyard government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.D;The house of Savoy had bided its time but they have successfully managed to take control of the Confederation by appointing their chosen government with the help of many Italian nationalists and various opponents inside the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.A;What does this entail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.T;The Council of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.D;The various officials of the Italian states who are members of the Confederation have gathered in $THISCAPITAL$ to discuss the future of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.A;The dice is cast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.T;A Stable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.D;While many thought that the Confederation was living its last hours, temperance has prevailed in the Council, as all its members recognized that they were better in this Confederation than independent and only to be prey to the Aragonese and Piedmontese. Thus endures the Confederation, and maybe one day, it will be the legitimate Italian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.A;Long live the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.T;Collapse of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.D;The compromise that created the Italian confederation has failed to endure. The various members of this polity decided to dissolve the state and go their separate ways following decades of political inertia and divisions. Italy becomes fractured again, and no one knows who will profit from this return to the old times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.A;Damn the divisions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.T;The Unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.D;Following the appointment of the Piedmontese grand-duke as head of the Confederation, many feared that the Aragonese would try to disrupt the new power in the North. But unable to intervene, this has left the Savoyards to cement their rule of the Confederation and finally proclaim a united Italian Kingdom under their helm. Now Italy exists, and not just as a weak state unable to resolve disputes between the various interests groups that composed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.A;Avanti Italia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.T;Savoyard Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.D;A weak Italian Confederation served our interests well since it allowed us to play the various members of this state one against another. But the pesky Savoyards have appointed their own government following the recent political instability in the Confederation, and if we don’t act soon they could easily proclaim a united Italy. Our best chance is to secure Rome and the Pope swiftly and deal with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.A;Rome must be protected !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.B;We are not strong enough to face the Savoyards…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.T;The Italian Liberation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.D;Aragonese troops walked into Rome following the announcement of the reorganization of the Confederation under the house of Savoy. This is an outrage to all Italian patriots and it has strengthened our rule. But we must march south unless we want Italy to still be disunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.A;To Rome !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.B;The Confederation is fine without the South…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.T;Victory of the House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.D;The mobilized forces of the reorganized Italian confederation have liberated Rome from Aragonese occupation. Following this tremendous success, the Grand-Duke of Piedmont was officially crowned King of Italy and abolished the former Confederation. A new power has emerged on the European scene, and soon Italy will surely be completely independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.A;FERT !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.T;Victory of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.D;The Italian Confederation could not vanquish our forces in Rome, leaving us in control of the old city, the Pope and crushing any hope the Savoyards entertained about using the Confederation as a tool for their ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.A;Our ambitions are intact !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.T;Intervention in Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.D;The Papal states have been recreated only to be annexed by us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.A;A good conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.D;Backed by foreign interests, Piedmont has declared war on the Italian Confederation. Should they win, they will not stop at just Northern Italy, already planning for the conquest of our southern holdings. Now is the time for action and war against the Confederation to carve the North before Savoyards take it. Although that also means that we could end up facing the Great Power that protects and helps them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR27.B;We can’t risk it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR28.T;Aragonese intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

buy_NZH_desc;After the death of Prince Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod, Princess Anna was thrown into a difficult position due to her lack of legitimacy. Despite her victory against Yaroslavl, the little principality is suffering under its ailing economy and political unrest. This gives us the opportunity to offer the princess an easy way out in the form of buying the principality off her hands. This may be a great diplomatic victory for Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

second_starya_oath_desc;Novgorod is ascendent. The southern warlords have not managed to topple the majesty of Lord Novgorod the Great and its holy and regal institutions. Now Novgorod stands united and strong against all who may conspire against it, both from within Russia and from outside.The states of our confederation will now join together in a union stronger and tighter than ever before, and Novgorod will march into the future with confidence and strength!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

form_great_perm_desc;The Ugrian people have long been divided by the various conniving Russian states that sought to exploit our lands for their economic prosperity. Now our people have come together, united by our collective desire to combat Russian domination of our lands. United, we may assert Ugrian independence in the face of Russia, and protect our land, culture, language and tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MOS_southern_expansion_title;Southern Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MOS_southern_expansion_desc;The South was always caught in a chaotic swirl that did not characterize our homeland in central Russia. From Cossack lords to Turkic khanates, the South is a diverse and wild land. With our newly found unity, the South appears less threatening each day, and conquering and taming it may bear fruit for our nation. We should expect a struggle with the Cossacks and the khanates, but Russia’s march towards the Black Sea is inevitable, for the land doesn’t belong to Cossacks, Tatars, or Turks, but to holy Russia alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MOS_northern_expansion_title;Northern Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MOS_northern_expansion_desc;Novgorod stood as an abomination in our eyes for a long time, with a government of a mangled republic combined with a corrupt principality. Serving as the lap dogs of Scandinavia has not given ‘Lord Novgorod the Great’ the prosperity and power to block our rightful path for the restoration and unification of the Russian lands. As our holdings in central Russia crystalize, we can finally march north and knock the arrogant merchants of Novgorod off their throne, and take it for ourselves and for all of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CSK_northern_expansion_title;Northern Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CSK_northern_expansion_desc;We have vanquished the feudal lords of Moscow, and now the gates northwards are swung open before us. In the North, Novgorod stands, an ancient republic, far more invested in Scandinavia than Russia. This nation of Novgorod is a stepping stone in our pursuit of the whole of Russia, whereupon its conquest our people will travel from the familiar Dnieper river and the Black sea up to the frozen Baltic and White Seas.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

centralize_russia_desc;We have struggled for decades for a united Russian state, from tiny bickering principalities to a glorious empire. But the vestiges of the old era are still present, treaties, borders, autonomies, agreements, and old privileges of various princes weigh Russia down. To truly create a great Russian state, we must unify the country. We will do away with these old autonomies and become what we truly are destined to be.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
left_bank_of_volga_title;Left bank of the Volga;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
left_bank_of_volga_desc;For centuries the Tatars have ravaged the lands of the holy Rus, robbing, pillaging and enslaving our people. Not anymore, our countrymen say, for now Russia is united and strong. Our borders are well defined on the western and northern frontiers, but the savage nomads of the East threaten the security of our realm, and to guarantee that security we must secure the left bank of the mighty Volga river. From there, the ancient threat of the Tatars will evaporate and Russia will remain ascendant on the eastern frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_first_step_east_desc;The dam that held back the might of Russia is now breached open, and the petty khanates of the east stand no chance in resisting us. With our military forces at hand we may subjugate the lands of Sibir and Perm, and settle it with our people to exploit the wealth of the land. In the foreseeable decades, Russian settlers will bolster the economy of the region and our nation as a whole by expanding the fur trade and mining industry eastwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_western_plan_RUS_title;The Western Plan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_western_plan_RUS_desc;The crown of Poland and Lithuania has plagued the Russian nation for centuries, subjugating the Ruthenian people and corrupting their faith. Poland has proven to be a subjugator of the Slavic people rather than their leader, but Russia can do better. Russia will lead the path for the liberation of the Ruthenian people from Polish domination, and claim the lands to our west as lands of the Russian crown.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_southern_plan_RUS_title;The Southern Plan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_southern_plan_RUS_desc;The southern plains stretch deep into the mountainous lands of the diverse Caucasians, Turks, Iranians and Tatars. Securing the Caucasus mountains will secure the southern borders of Russia, allow us to project our power unto the near east, and safeguard the Black Sea as a Russian domain.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_northern_plan_RUS_title;The Northern Plan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_northern_plan_RUS_desc;Russia’s future lies within its access to the sea, or at least that is what many within our government claim. The White Sea remains unreliable, as it remains frozen for most of the year. The Baltic Sea, on the other hand, is a far more reliable body of water, which alone could bolster Russian trade and our economy. Unfortunately, another nation covets the sea as its personal domain: Scandinavia. Scandinavia’s chokehold over the Baltic Sea was always a roadblock in the path of Russian prosperity. But now, we possess the strength to seize and control that sea for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_grand_ruthenian_conquest_title;The Grand Ruthenian Conquest;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_grand_ruthenian_conquest_desc;The time to unite the Ruthenian people has come. The Polish crown has occupied Ruthenian lands for almost a millenia, but with our help, this abomination of the polonised Russians will finally meet its end. White, Black, and Red Ruthenia are all integral parts of Russia. And with this conquest, we will finally achieve union with our White Russian brethrens!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_belarus_title;Conquest of Belarus;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_belarus_desc;Belarus, unshackled from Poland, is now free for us to conquer. The people of White Ruthenia perhaps will try to resist our advancement, but only for their ignorance of our shared heritage and their centuries long lives under the Polish boot. Russia will stretch up to Grodno, and our empire will not be stopped, for White Ruthenia is a gateway for the west and our future prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_ukraine_title;Conquest of Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_ukraine_desc;The Ruthenian people of the South are not forgotten in $CAPITAL$. Ukraine’s agricultural importance is not lost on us, and this new Russian holding will help support our Ruthenian kin in the millions. Ukraine’s importance also lies within its access to the Black Sea and the Crimean peninsula, access to sea that our country so desperately needs. Lastly, Ukraine represents a path to the Balkan, another entry to the west that would surely prove beneficial for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_into_red_ruthenia_title;Move into Red Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_into_red_ruthenia_desc;Out of all the Ruthenian people, the Red Ruthenians have been under Polish domination for the longest. They adopted their religion, their culture, and their customs. We will not let this injury go unpunished. Our thrust westwards will include Red Ruthenia, it is still afterwards our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

triumph_in_the_west_desc;Our western conquests have concluded in a complete victory! Our land stretches up to the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains! The Ruthenian people are at last united. Now, as the western frontier is secured we may turn in different directions, where further glory may be won for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_cossack_claims_title;The Cossack claim;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_cossack_claims_desc;The Cossacks in the south have broken away from our people long ago. But they cannot deny their place as part of Russia and the Ruthenian people! After centuries of lawlessness, we may finally bring law to the rowdy Pontic Steppe and its wild assortment of hordes, hosts and khannates.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
slay_the_turkish_stronghold_title;Slay the Turkish stronghold;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
slay_the_turkish_stronghold_desc;Crimea was a foothold of Turkic menace on the steppes of Russia, and through all these centuries, it escaped the wrath of Ruthenians, Poles and Lithuanians on horseback. In addition, the Crimeans also impose an difficult obstacle on our policymakers: access to the Black Sea. With the Crimean peninsula serving as the khanate’s heartland, it is difficult for our state to truly utilize the Black Sea for our benefit. With the downfall of the Crimeans, Russia will further its goals in the quest for dominance in the South!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  
the_dreams_of_cossacks_title;The dreams of the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_dreams_of_cossacks_desc;The Cossacks have long dreamt of reaching the Caspian sea, riding eastwards and establishing new hosts. Due to over extension this dream has never bore fruit. But it may now, as Russian eastward expansion may allow the Cossacks to move and settle under our administration, forming regional clans in newly conquered areas, and helping to keep order among the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
demolish_cirassia_title;Demolish Circassia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
demolish_cirassia_desc;Circassia stands on the edge of the Caucasus Mountains, one last foe before we reach the magnificent frontier. We cleaved through the Cossacks, Tatars and Turks, the Circassians will not be any different, for Russia’s destiny lays on the snowy mountaintops of the harsh Caucasus Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
triumph_in_the_south_title;Triumph in the South;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_south_desc;The South has been tamed. No hordes, no hosts, and no khanates, only Russia’s might dominate these lands. Both our physical frontier is secured in the mountainous south, as well as our naval backyard on the rocky shores of the Crimean coast. Russia has broken the Turkic grip that held it down for centuries, and has brought security to its periphery.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clean_up_ingria_title;Mop Ingria up;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
clean_up_ingria_desc;Without their Scandinavian overlord, the watchdogs of the East have lost their bite. After the untimely departure of Scandinavia, the lands that are indisputably Russian may finally be cleaned up and brought back into their Russian kin. This may also help us secure our much needed claim on the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_title;The Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_desc;Livonia has been in Scandinavian hands for over a millennium. But can they really back their claim to these lands anymore? As Russia awoke from its millennium long slumber, Livonia is shaken from its flimsy Scandinavian shackles, to be brought into Russia. This territory establishes a true foothold on the Baltic coast, and as such must be acquired by our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secure_russian_karelia_title;Secure Russian Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
secure_russian_karelia_desc;Karelia has been strongly tied with Novgorod for centuries, this is obviously well known. It’s current owners, however, have maintained their hold over the region not by their strength, but by our weakness. Such weakness is no longer present, and we will show the northmen that legitimacy can only be earned by the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_scandinavian_folly_title;The Scandinavian folly;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_scandinavian_folly_desc;Scandinavia is effectively an overseas power, and the reason for this is the cold and barren Finland. Finland is the wall Scandinavia cowers behind when it so cowardly threatens Russia. But this wall can be turned against the petty Scandinavians, for with ease we could conquer Finland and establish our own dominion over it, stripping the northmen of their last imperial possession in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
triumph_in_the_north_title;Triumph in the North;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_north_desc;Scandinavia has been dismantled, and has limped away across the Baltic Sea to their frigid home. Now the Baltics, Karelia, and Finland are under Russian authority, as we went from holding a barely functional White Sea port, to the grand Baltic shore. From the Gulf of Finland to the gulf of Riga, we may now enjoy the prosperity of Baltic trade. But our victories don’t end there, with Baltic trade comes access to the West, as the only thing that separates our state from the ones of Central and Western Europe’s is a short boat trip. With the conquest of the North comes the embrace of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_sibir_title;Integrate Sibir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_sibir_desc;Sibir has stared at us across Siberia for centuries, out of our reach. Now we leaped across Eurasia, establishing footholds all over Siberia. The Khanate of Sibir is one of our footholds in the region, influenced by cunning diplomacy and our economic power. Now we may use that leverage to establish a protectorate over the khanate and integrate it into the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_kazan_title;Integrate Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_kazan_desc;Kazan has been an awkward interloper in Russian affairs, exploiting our division to pillage and enslave our people. Kazan’s presence has slowly shrunk over the years as Russia has coalesced into a powerful nation, and now poses no threat to our security. But Russian interests in the region demand action, Kazan is still in our way eastwards, and its rivers will prove useful for our economy. Now that Kazan has been declawed, we may be able to force it into our empire diplomatically, turning it into a mere protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_bashkir_title;Integrate Bashkir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_bashkir_desc;Bashkir lays in the middle of the Ural Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Aral Sea. A symbolic gateway eastwards, wherefrom we may not only ride eastwards, but also southwards to the lands of Persia and India. Like the rest of the petty khanates, economic and military pressure might prove to be an easier solution to direct military action, for we have gone a long way since the Russian nation has exploded outwards from its Slavic heartlands.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_final_play_title;The final play;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_final_play_desc;The Tatars are boxed in, they cower in the East across the Volga, never could they have imagined a time where the Slavic people will rise to threaten them. With this, we will establish the borders for our future governorate in the region, preemptively cutting Tatar lands to shreds and establishing an administration for our governorate in the region. The days of the marauders are short...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

accept_ruthenian_cultures_desc;Centuries of separation stands before us and the Ruthenians, centuries of Polish and Lithuanian occupation and subjugation. This separation drove some cultural differences between us and the western Ruthenians, but we may finally amend those differences and embrace the White Ruthenians and the Malorussians back into our realm, for they are nothing but Russian!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
accept_north_tatar_cultures_title;Accept North Tatar cultures;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
accept_north_tatar_cultures_desc;We don’t love the Tatars of the East, that much is known both to them and to us. But as our empire extends in all directions, we must come to terms with reality: cooperation and compromise is sometimes necessary for our empire’s existence. We will tolerate the Tatars and allow them autonomy within our empire, in order to prevent unrest on a massive scale, and maintain a stable connection to our Siberian holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

accept_astrakhani_culture_desc;We don’t love the Astrakhanis to the South, that much is known both to them and to us. But as our empire extends in all directions, we must come to terms with reality: cooperation and compromise is sometimes necessary for our empire’s existence. We will tolerate Astrakhan and allow it autonomy within our empire, in order to prevent unrest on a massive scale, and maintain a stable connection to our holdings in the South and on the steppes.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
accept_crimean_culture_title;Accept Crimean culture;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
accept_crimean_culture_desc;We don’t love the Crimean Tatars of the Pontic steppe, that much is known both to them and to us. But as our empire extends in all directions, we must come to terms with reality: cooperation and compromise is sometimes necessary for our empire’s existence. We will tolerate the Crimeans and allow them autonomy within our empire, in order to prevent unrest on a massive scale, and maintain our most important position in the Crimean peninsula and the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

accept_galician_culture_desc;Out of all of our Ruthenian brothers, no other were polonised quite as much as the Red Ruthenians.The Galicians have adopted the Roman Catholic faith, and their tongue is influenced heavily by the Polish one. Some work will obviously need to be done in order to integrate those misled Ruthenians back to their true family in the East. We mustn’t forget our brothers in the West who were not so fortunate to keep their independence over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Il est temps de porter nos efforts vers l'avenir de notre nation: les vastes étendues de la Sibérie, qui n'attendent que les colons russes pour les développer.;The Siberian plains were claimed by the Russian rulers since the times of Vladimir Atlasov and Danila Antsiferov.

move_capital_TVE_title;The White City;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_TVE_desc;The new Russian tsardom has secured its hold over Eastern Europe and gained access to the Baltic. While Tver, Yaroslavl and Vladimir are all important cities, the Tsar and the nation need a new capital city to show to the world the wonders Russia is capable of. Out of the swamps of the Neva in Nyenschantz, we will use the tremendous workforce of the freed serfs to build Belskaya, where soon our Belsky rulers will sit and decide the fate of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_MUS_title;The Red Fort;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_MUS_desc;Moscow could have been an early centre for Russia, as the Princes of Moscow nearly unified Russia in the 15th century. But the city has been sacked and burned several times throughout history. Now that the princes of Moscow have unified Russia, it is time for new streets to be paved while the old Kremlin is refit for the new imperial government.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_RYA_title;Alexandria on the Don;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_RYA_desc;The port of Tanais has become a summer residence for many boyars along with members of the imperial family thanks to its proximity to the Black Sea. For many years the imperial government has entertained the idea of building a new Russian capital here, easily accessible to the sea and thus to international trade while symbolizing the new might of the Slavs over the Tatars. Let the old port transform itself into a city worthy of the old 'Gunpowder Prince' Alexander Repnin, Alexandrovsk!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_NZH_title;Volga Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_NZH_desc;The Volga river is the main artery of trade and wealth in the new Russia, which has been born thanks to the opening of Tatar lands to colonization. The old city of Saraj was built on a strategic path, where the Don and Volga river get close enough to build a canal. Our government plans that around this vital canal a city would be built that will outshine the mosques and bazaars from the old Tatar 'city' and serve as the rightful capital of the nation!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_NOV_title;Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_NOV_desc;What other city could outshine Novgorod in Russia and serve as its capital? None. But as proud as everyone is of the oldest city of the East, it is admitted that the lack of urban planning and the uncertainties of the past years have led to a demand for renewed urban works. With this, the capital of Russia can shine and be recognized internationally as the greatest city of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_SMO_title;Our heritage;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_SMO_desc;Kiev was the capital of the first state of Rus' and is thus the natural choice of capital for our Slavic union, but at the same time the city has seen better days. The Polish treated it as the last city before the frontier and generally left no trace of their passage outside of the Catholic churches. We will rebuild it as a vibrant and mighty city like in the times of the Princes of Kiev, with an important focus on the Palace of the People that will host the Slavic Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_CSK_title;The Eastern Capital;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_CSK_desc;Kharkov has served as the natural seat of government for the unified hosts thanks to its central location in Ukraine. But as our state grows in the East the need for a new capital has become more pressing. Many call for the old city of Saraj to be planned as the new capital as we build a canal between the Don and the Volga rivers. The old slums and inadequate buildings will be swept away as the new city of Slavsjank becomes the symbol of the might of the Slavs over the Steppe people.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

URUS01.D;Our government is established, the governor is on his way, and our borders are being finalized. May we bring Russia’s civilization to our newly acquired lands!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

URUS02.T;Integration;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS02.D;Now that the new territories are under our control, we may start our work of integrating it into the Russian empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS02.A;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS03.T;The championed governorate;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS03.D;Our governorate is favored and championed among the governorates of Russia, we hold the lands that the government has deemed Russia’s top priority of integration. Thus, we would enjoy Russia’s favor over the rest of the governorates.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS03.A;It’s our pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS04.T;Territorial Exchange;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS04.D;One of our territories is deemed to be transferred to a different governorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS04.A;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS05.T;Integration continues;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS05.D;Our efforts at integration are paying off! Our officers feel quite at home in $COUNTRY$, and new colonial offices spring up every day.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

URUS06.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ effort to integrate our foreign lands is paying off. In recent reports, the governorate has reported that unrest is decreasing and colonial garrisons are increasing at an impressive rate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS06.A;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS07.T;Integration continues further;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS07.D;Our colonial officers are holding a celebration in $CAPITAL$. Apparently, our task of integrating the governorates is proceeding quite nicely. Many hope that soon the governorate will become a part of Russia proper, and its officers will carry the prestige of pacifying its people and carrying Russia’s destiny to the periphery.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS07.A;Let us inform Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS075.T;Integration completed!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS075.D;Our herculean task is at hand, we have brought the foreing lands of Russia’s backdoor to the fold! In the cities Russian officers wander, and its shops carry Russian signs, while our proud and noble flag flies proud above the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS075.A;Three hurrahs to Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS08.T;The integration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS08.D;Exciting news from $FROMCOUNTRY$, as the governorate reports its confidence in its integration into Russia proper! For a long time, the governorate worked to bring its territories ever so close to our country, and now that hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS08.A;Russia grows ever larger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS09.T;The governorate collapses!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS09.D;Our authority in the governorate has collapsed! The native population has begun carving the land back into native states, effectively abolishing our governorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS09.A;Oh, dear;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS10.T;The governorate falls!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS10.D;We have vanquished Russia’s precious governorate in our homeland! Now is the time to once again decide our own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS10.A;May they never return!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS11.T;Governmental Realignment;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS11.D;Russia has intervened to appoint a more preferred government in the governorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS11.A;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS12.T;Integration of the Tatars;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS12.D;Integrating the Tatars shall be a difficult task, their language, culture and faith are all but foreign to our people, and the independent spirit of the Tatars will not be easily vanquished. But that has never stopped us. Our government shall send its finest officers to Tatarstan and will bring Russia’s government to the land, sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URUS12.A;Hopefully sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.T;The New Troubles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.D;The idea of a united Russia was born under the leaderships of the Princes of Moscow in the XIVth and XVth century but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia. Yaroslav, Moscow and Ryazan all had their hour of glory but Tatar attacks, Polish or Scandinavian supports for their enemies or pure incompetence led to an ever changing balance of power between the three princedoms. Konstantin IV Belsky of Yaroslav hopes to unify the Russians under his absolute rule to modernize the country. The Repnins of Ryazan must face a powerful Boyar assembly who thrives on serfdom. Meanwhile, Nizhny Novgorod never had the power of the other contestants, though its links to the East and the confusing situation surrounding her Prince Alexey II may lead to an opportunity to get power. The status quo holds because of the Scandinavian and Polish networks in the area but with Poland and Scandinavia growing weaker it will soon break.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.T;The Principality of Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.D;In 1836, the Lyapunov Princedom of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, and the defection of a Smolenskan noble confederation in Vyazma, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europe’s sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians. In the meantime his sister Anna reign in Nizhny Novgorod alongside her husband Alexey II. But troubles are brewing in all Russia as the Republic of Novgorod crumbles under its contradictions while the various princes hope to vanquish us to reunify what Ivan III nearly achieved in the XVth century. /n /n Warning : Moscow has the hardest time forming Russia since it only has access to the Form Russia decision since it is the status quo candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.T;The Principality of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.D;The Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between Russian states and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Iaroslav-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere of influence and in the last 40 years the title of Prince of Smolensk has been part of the long list of honorifics of the Polish king. The princedom is de facto ruled by a Governor, currently General Aleksander Kilinski, who has to wrestle authority with the local Duma controlled by Boyar families and the Archeparch. Smolensk has agitated for years against Poland, and the recent loss of its Eastern territories to Moscow has cemented the idea among the population and the elites that the Polish yoke will have to be thrown out and Smolesnk regain its independence. Smolensk is the Russian state that has taken the most influence from the West with the Enlightnment works translated and discussed in the salons of the capital : should it seize the occasion and unite Russia, it will surely be a new era for Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.T;Polonizacja;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.D;The annexation of Smolensk by the Commonwealth led to the extension of Western habits in the Princedom. Smolensk is thus home to the first Russian-language University and has become one of the liveliest cultural centres of Eastern Europe, especially for literature and theatrical drama. In the halls of the university, students gather in various meetings and recent inquiries have shown the development of Nationalist speeches in its halls. Governor Aleksander Kilinski decided to act by passing a law to bring the Smolensk university to the same standard as the rest of the Rzeczpospolita, namely making the usage of Polish language mandatory while restricting access to the Jewish and non-Uniate students. Of course it meant receiving the approval of the Duma which had vetoed most of his decisions in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.A;Smolensk will be taught Polish!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.B;The law is vetoed in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.T;University protests;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.D;The Polish debate in the Duma was met with hostility by the student leaders and some professors who criticized both the Polonization policy of the Governor acting on the orders of Warsaw and the aristocratic Duma that clung to its privilege. Students poured into the streets brandishing the White-Blue-Red banner that has become in the previous years a pan-Russian nationalist symbol. The demonstration nearly ended in a riot before the Smolenskian guards of Kelinski dispersed the students without shedding any blood. The day after, a new journal was born, 'Svoboda i Narodnost' (Freedom and Nation) whose director Michel Shafirov had become a public figure following a speech in the demonstration. It has become evident to many Polish administrators that Smolensk could erupt into revolt in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.A;Damn students!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.T;The Smolensk Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.D;Unrest had grown in the whole Principality of Smolensk for months, with the newspaper 'Freedom and Nation' stirring up the various causes of discontent against Warsaw. Following the news of the death of the King of the Commonwealth, the various nationalist groups clamored for an end to Polish rule in Smolensk and demonstrations erupted in the capital. With students joined by the members of all classes of the city, the governor Kilinski was soon abandoned by its troops and forced to flee to Kaunas. The Duma was soon convened by the Archeparch and the nobles were quick to use the events to proclaim Smolenskian independence. However the crowd led by Shafirov, soon entered the Duma demanding the abolition of serfdom. With the troops rallied to the insurgents, the Archeparch soon proclaimed its end and called for the Duma to reconvene two weeks later to decide the future of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.A;The Revolution has freed the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.T;Ending the Regency.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.D;As the Archeparch had proclaimed, the Duma reconvened to decide who shall rule the Principality. Adding to the traditional seats held by the Boyars and the clergy, the cities had sent representatives for the first time in its history. In this new assembly the Archeparch proposed for Prince, the experienced Vasily Kropotkin, a descendant of the Rurikids. Meanwhile the aristocrats attempted to place one of their own, Stanislav Bagushevic, wary of the power of a Prince supported by the Archeparch. With the nobility split, it was to the new deputies to decide. Shafirov who represented Smolensk meanwhile advocated for the end of the Princedom : Smolensk should be a Confederation under the symbolic protection of the Archeparch like in Kiev and most of all grant voting rights to all its population. He argued that liberating the serfs was meanless without their participation in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.A;Kropotkin ascends the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.B;The Duma chooses Bagushevic.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.C;The Republic is proclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.D;Kilinski had been forced to flee but he did not intend to let the revolutionaries win. Without any support of the Sejm in Warsaw he was forced to rely on the networks and relations he had created while in office. He gained support in Belarusian provinces of the South who were weary of the plans for Russian national unification and had more ties with the Grand-Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy would have succeeded if he had not been discovered crossing the border and had to flee back to Warsaw. Eventually the Smolenskian forces were able to disperse the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.A;We should watch closely the South.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS9.T;The Kilinski plot;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS9.D;Kilinski had been forced to flee but he did not intend to let the revolutionaries win. Without any support of the Sejm in Warsaw he was forced to rely on the networks and relations he had created while in office. He gained support in Belarusian provinces of the South who were weary of the plans for Russian national unification and had more ties with the Grand-Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy reached Smolensk but was ultimately denounced by an officer who decided to side with the newly independent government of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS9.A;Will we be free of this man ? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.D;Kilinski may have failed to take control of Smolensk but he soon find enough supporters in the Belarusian provinces of the South who were weary of the promises of war by the new governement and who had more ties with the Commonwealth than with Russia. He has now proclaimed the secession of the southern provinces who hail the white and red flag.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.A;Smolensk is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.T;The Vyazma Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.D;A decade ago nobles on our eastern border left the Principality, choosing the Prince of Moscow as their new liege because of the heavy taxation imposed by Kilinski. This was a blow to the already waning influence of the Commonwealth which could not lift a finger to avoid it, mostly because they had allied with Moscow against Scandinavia and Yaroslav. With our independence secured many think it is time to reclaim our lost lands to secure the capital and prepare ourselves for the fights to come. But many nobles already angered by the end of serfdom in Smolensk refuse to accept preparatives for war, with the Duma increasingly divided on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.A;War will come anyway, we must strike first!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.B;War is vetoed in the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.T;The Vozhd;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.D;The veto of the war preparatives paralysed the Duma, as the aristocracy clashed with the nationalists and liberals. Eventually the situation deteriorated to the point that a young officer, Commander Mikhail Tomylovic, left his barrack with his regiment and stormed the Duma. Unknown before, this officer who had risen from the ranks, his parents being freed serfs was now in charge of the destiny of the state. Proclaiming himself 'Vozhd', Leader of the People, he abolished the Duma and arrested several boyars of high rank while forcing the Archeparch to resign from its leadership role. Now the preparations begin for the oncoming war because the Vozhd will not let Moscow shame Smolesnk anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.A;A new leader for Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.T;The Smolensk embassy;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.D;Eventually the demands of the Smolenskian states were written to the Prince of Moscow : he was to cede back the unlawful territories he had usurped in the past decade or face war from Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.A;It is merely for diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.T;Smolenskian declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.D;We had extended our western border in 1829 following the secession of a league of nobles angered by taxation from the Polish administration of Smolensk. But now they have declared independence, the Smolenskian come after us reclaiming these lands. Warsaw had not interved when they did their revolution. They will not intervene now for such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.A;We can defeat Smolensk easily!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.T;The declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.D;It is time to retake back our lands from Moscow and free our brothers still suffering under serfdom!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.A;Vyazma shall be ours again!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.T;Return of the Vyazman Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.D;Moscow has been crushed by our modern forces and we have retaken our lands in the East. It is a great victory for $THISCOUNTRY$ and the first actions we have undertaken is to put to trial the boyars who seceded in 1829 while freeing the serfs from these provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS23.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.D;The succession of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating Central Russia. The current prince, Alexey is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite his decade of marriage, both hope to inherit the Principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for figurative and performing arts. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that the Prince is an homosexual and thus unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have weeped at the lecture of 'The Green Prince' and decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife and the counts Balakhnin and Varankin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.A;A strange affair...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.D;The succession of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating Central Russia. The current prince, Alexey is both the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite having been married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver hope to inherit the Principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for theater and ballets. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that a Prince enjoying acting on stage among other 'foreign vices' is unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have been so angered at the lecture of 'The Green Prince' that he decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife Anna as the counts Kondraty Balakhnin and Grigory Varankin, both men known for their respective ties to Tver and Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.A;Retiring alone in his dacha will not give him an offspring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.T;A day in the countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.D;Alexey II had been enjoying his sojourn at his hunting dacha that his father had embellished to make it as furnished as the palace in the city. Alexey had only made the place bigger, reserving an entire aisle for his theatric endeavours. When Anna Lyapunova his wife came to the residency with general Temey Talantsev escorting her, the Prince was playing the main role of Orpheus, a melodrama by the Bohemian playwriter, Ludwid Schubert. Following the ending of the play, the Prince retired to its private quarter with his wife. No one knew what transpired of their exchanges but the Princess decided to reside for an undefinite time in the dacha with her husband, leaving affairs of state to the various factions in Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.A;What is the meaning of all this ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.T;An heir for Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, Prince Alexey has emerged to announce that his wife is pregnant of his son and heir. To relieve his melancholy caused by the attacks of politicians and the pressures of his natural family and step family, 2 years earlier Alexey had delegated all political affairs to Anna Lyapunova, with whom he had an undeniable close and affectionate relationship. This announcement at the end of a routine long stay of the Princess at the dacha has shocked the Russian courts, many speculating that the presumptive heir would actually be a legitimised child of the Princess and her latest publicly known paramour. Yet after a slightly premature childbirth, healthy Mikhail Belsky was declared the natural son of the Prince and Princess and sole legitimate heir to Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.A;Long live Michael !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.T;Family news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the cousin of our Prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to Nizhny Novgorod to present his son Michael to the crowd. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the Prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. That Michael II is a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we would have the right to denounce the child as unlegitimate to claim the Principality that was ours a few decades ago. But should Moscow support the Princess and recognize her offspring legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.A;Congratulate Alexey for the enlargement of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.B;Michael is a bastard and Anna a woman of little virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.T;Family news;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the brother-in-law of our Prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to his capital to present his son Michael to the crowd. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the Prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. The Moscow court always was wary of Anna who always appeared ambitious and full of vices for the devout circles in court. That Michael II is a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we could denounce the conduct of Anna Lyapunova. But should Yaroslav support the Princess and recognize her offspring legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in this Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.A;Congratulate Anna for this birth!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.B;Anna has dishonored the Lyapunov family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.T;Denounciation of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.D;The Prince of Moscow has declared not recognizing our heir as legitimate, denouncing the shameful conduct of the Princess which used another man to cover for the 'foreign vices' of her husband. Count Kondraty Balakhnin, the leader of the pro-Yaroslav faction in the Court has joined the Prince in the palace to suggest him to dissolve the Duma and purge the Muscovian plotters that held power in it, with of course the support of Yaroslav. Meanwhile the Princess warned him of the influence of the Yaroslav faction that could use the purge of the Duma to ensure their own power in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.A;Alexey trusts the Count.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.B;Alexey follows the advice of his wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.T;A letter to Yaroslav;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.D;The plots of the Yaroslav faction have born fruits. Following the recent events at the Court and in the Duma, Count Balakhnin has secured power and put the Princely family under surveillance in their palace to avoid the various assassination plots that had sprung in the previous weeks. Exchanges of letters between Nizhny Novgorod and the court of Yaroslav are seen daily as the Count prepares for the reunification of the Belsky familial lands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.A;Well this backfired.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.T;A letter from Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.D;Our man in Nizhny Novgorod, the Count Balakhnin has taken power following the events that saw the discussion of the legitimacy of the heir of the principality by our rivals in Moscow. Nizhny Novgorod is now our puppet and Balakhnin assures us that the current situation will soon 'be resolved' as the melancholy of the Prince is becoming more evident each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.A;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.T;The end of the Princedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.D;Events unfolded quickly in the Principality. Alexey was found dead hanging in his appartments. The Prince always had melancholy excesses and the news of his suicide did not surprise any at the court. His death was masked as a 'bad fall' to not tarnish his memory but as soon as he was buried Balakhnin moved. Disregarding Michael II as an infant, he called the Duma to offer the Crown to the senior Belsky branch in Yaroslav. Meanwhile the Dowager Princess was abducted by remnants of the Moscow faction who sent her to her brother who made her abdicate her claims to the Princedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.T;Anna's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.D;On the advice of his wife, Alexey asked the Duma to confirm Mikhail as heir of the princedom but faced opposition from the boyars who refused to acknowledge his successor given Muscovite accusations. His attempt to dissolve the Duma and enforce his succession by decree failed due to the betrayal of military figures close to the pro-Moscow circle including Grigory Varankin, a former paramour of his wife. In the chaos that followed, the three leaders of the boyar cliques in Nizhny Novgorod all had their chance at power. Balakhnin proposed to reconvene the Duma while purging the Muscovite with the help of Yaroslav, Grigory Varankin's soldiers were ready to take power and reclaim the lands of Ivanovo from Yaroslav with Muscovian help while Anna Lyapunova urged the general Temey Talantsev secure the Regency for her son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.A;Balakhnin secures the Duma for the Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.B;Varankin vows to reclaim the rightful lands in Yaroslav;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.C;Talantsev secures the independence of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.T;News from Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.D;Following our declaration that we didn't recognize Michael as the rightful heir of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod, his 'father' Alexey tried to reaffirm his status in the Duma only to fail against the Count Grigory Varankin who has asked for our support in ending Nizhny Novgorod's plights. Moreover to secure his rule, he has claimed back the province of Ivanovo from Yaroslav since the Princedom held it centuries ago. In the long time we can easily convince Varankin to surrender powers to our Prince, but it will surely need a war against Yaroslav.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.A;It's a good news for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.T;The Belsky inheritance;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.D;Alexey II of Nizhny Novgorod was ousted from his Princedom by a pro-Moscow clique in the Duma who forced him into exile. Arriving in Yaroslav, the depressed Prince asked to abandon its titles to his cousin and retire to a monastery. Konstantin IV accepted and now claims to be the rightful Prince of Nizhny Novgorod. Claiming his inheritance will not be easy as Varankin has claimed the Ivanovo Principality that was once part of Nizhny Novgorod and declaring war on him means also war with Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.A;We shall claim our inheritance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.B;We can wait ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.T;Request from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.D;The new Generalissimo of Nizhny Novgorod has contacted us to ask us for our support in protecting the small principality. With Chuvash blood, Talantsev is often seen as an 'half-Tatar', even though he has barely any ressemblance with people living in Kazan. His argument is simple : should NZH fall to either Moscow or Yaroslav, these opportunists may soon decide to go down the Idel and attack us, while an independent Nizhny Novgorod means safety for the Khanate from  the North-West.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.A;Weakening the Russians is in our interest !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.B;Leave him alone, he is not to be trusted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.T;The threat from Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.D;General Talantsev had taken control of the state by protecting the Princely family and arranging for the purge of the hostile factions in the Duma. Varankin had fled to Moscow and it appeared to the leader of Nizhny Novgorod that the only way for the city to gain its independence was to force Moscow to bow to the armies of Nizhny, with many volunteers coming to support the new chief of the state. But it was still a risky move, as Moscow while decaying and corrupted was still a force to reckon with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.A;We will take the Moscow Kremlin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.B;Independence can be secured peacefully;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.T;The War on Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.D;The new chief of Nizhny Novgorod has declared war on Moscow to avenge the plots they had intrigued in the past years. While it is not our interest to see Nizhny Novgorod gain too many power in this fight, weakening Moscow should be our primary objective, and thus our Prince has decided to declare war to avenge the stain on the Belsky family's honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.A;S'Nami Bog' !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.T;Denounciation of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.D;Following the presentation of Michael to the court and the foreign ambassadors, the Prince of Tver has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the heir and denounced Anna Lyapunova as a woman of little virtue who had desecrated the whole Princedom. These accusations spread to the Duma where the Yaroslav faction demanded the end of the Regency of the Princess, her husband still prefering his countryside dacha rather than rule in his own right. As tensions grow the Princess is faced with two choices : either align with her old ally in the Duma Grigory Varankin or count on the army under the orders of her paramour Talantsev, who many suggest is the real father of Michael.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.A;Grigory Varankin is our man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.B;Talantsev will protect his paramour;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.T;The Vozhd of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.D;Years ago, Talantsev was a minor noble coming from a Chuvash elder family that had made fortune on the Volga between the Khanate of Kazan and the Russian principalities. His talents were recognized and he gained rank thanks to the affection of Anna Lyupanova. But in the end he took power in the troubled times that faced Nizhny Novgorod abolishing the Princedom and taking the helm. He defended the independence of the city and proved to the people that he was a natural leader. Thanks to his new popularity he was able to crush boyar opposition and proclaim the end of serfdom. Now he has turned back on its Tatar allies claiming to free the people of Tartariya from slavery as he liberated serfs. This could serve him in the next fights against the Princes of Russia, and maybe he can become the 'Breaker of Chains', the providential man needed to unify the Eastern Slavs ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.A;Long live the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.T;The Princess of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.D;Anna Lyapunova won against all odds. A princess whose sole job was to marry and produce an heir, she managed to surpass every expectations, sidelining her husband and ruling over the Principality in its most troubled times. A master of intrigue she went from Regent for her son Michael to Princess ruling in her own right. The Duma has been abolished after her control over the state was affirmed and her first ukaze as autocrat of Nizhny Novgorod was to free the serfs living under her rule. The people have forgotten the scandals that surrounded her while Alexey was still around and she has been nicknamed the 'Mother of the People' by many pamphlets and all her trips over the country see crowds of former serfs gather to acclaim her. This opinion is shared by many in her home in Moscow, with many abolitionists looking up to the rising figure of the Lyapunov family to unify the Princedoms and maybe then all Russia !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.A;Long live the Princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.T;The Survival of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.D;Against all odds, Nizhny Novogrod has survived when by all means it should have been dissolved during the previous crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.A;Long live the... somebody?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.T;Threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is one of the main instigators behind the current situation in Russia. When at the apex of its power, the Polish Crown claimed the title of Prince of the Rus and invaded the Principalities provoking the Troubles (1592-1613). More recently they were the main instigators of the Nizhny Novgorod war, and Smolensk only regained its independence thanks to the decay of the Polish state apparatus. But now the new King of the Commonwealth has reformed the state and the country is now again a major force in Europe. The Princes of Russia must unite if they want to have a chance against the Polish Leviathan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.A;A new troubled Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.T;The Nordic threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.D;The Scandinavians have intervened in Russia for centuries, as Rurik and Oleg settled and founded Rus while Novgorod fought Swedish and Danish attacks in the times of Alexander Nevsky. More recently the Republic of the North was forced to release the Republic of Pskov that then acquired the Baltic coast. Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. Now the Scandinavians have attacked Novgorod and acquired proper Russian territory. It is an insult to all independent powers in Russia and has prompted every ruler to arm its subjects to unify the country once and for all, lest we are played once again by other powers and the Motherland is carved by them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.A;For the glory of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.T;Loss of Nordic influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. But now Scandinavian's influence is waning as events in Finland have provoked independence of core territories of the Nordic Crown. The states in Central Russia are now left to their own devices as no Great Power can actually reach out to them, and the unification of Central Russia should be swift and decisive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.A;Unification or death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.T;A rumor in Russia...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.D;Central Russia has been never truly unified as all attempts failed due to foreign powers interventions and local fighting forces. Ivan III of Moscow, Dimitri I of Tver, Feodor II of Yaroslav all look down on what Russia has become and what could have been. There is a rising sentiment that Russia must evolve to survive in the modern world and that the divisions must go away for a new nation emerge and protect the Motherland from all threats. Now is the time to forge a new Principality of Rus that will avenge the woes that Russia has suffered over the centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.A;But please do not repeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.T;The Muscovite Wars era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.D;Tensions had grown between the principalities of Central Russia over the last decades, only tampered by the possibility of foreign intervention. Now that this threat is gone, every leader in Central Russia wants to claim the title and power of the Grand Principality of Rus, which few rulers could claim in the history of Russia. No longer shall Central Russia be divided, and the masses are armed and ready for the coming fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS73.D;From the ashes of the divided principalities of Central Russia emerges $COUNTRY$, following the path traced by Ivan III the failed 'Tsar', Dimitri I 'the Savior' and Feodor II of Yaroslav. The Muscovite wars have claimed countless lives and now soldiers go back to their fields and cities to renew with a more normal life. This is the first stage for a new Russia to emerge but to avoid the fates of those who failed before, the ruler of $COUNTRY$ must now administrate the new lands under their control and let the land and its inhabitants rest before they take on new enemies and forge a true Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#CRUS76.T;The vision of Mikhail;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.D;Michael II Repnin has managed to bring back Ryazan to power and unify the Central Russian Lands as no ruler has ever done in the history of Russia. Curtailing the Boyars? powers, their rich estates are now worked in the name of the state. The rich lands of the South now feed the ever growing population of the Grand Principality. With soldiers loyal to him and his ideals of a Russia master of the steppe and thus her destiny, he now turns his eyes south to the Cossack and Tatar lands in which he will forge a new nation upon the ashes of her old enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.T;The realm of the Boyars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.D;The Boyars of Ryazan have withstood the problems caused by Michael II Repnin and held on their prerogatives in power. In the wars that followed, Ryazan emerged victorious, the Duma now becoming the main power responsible for Central Russia. Serfdom still is an important piece of the nation, and it has been used to fuel unprecedented population growth thanks to the rich lands from the South that the peasants from all Russia will now toil in. The aristocracy that guides the new unified Prince of the Rus knows where its interests lie. It is not in Northern Russia, filled with radicals and idealists that the Russian nation will be forged, but in the open lands of the South where lands only demand for the boyars to come and exploit them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.A;For the true nobility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.T;The expansion of the Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.D;The Vozhd of Smolensk rules over the unified Union of Muscovy, contemplating the efforts done in the former years. Inefficient rule of the Assemblies has been sidelined as Smolensk and the whole of Russia needed a strong but benevolent hand. And who but to lead the rising Russian nation but the Vozhd of the People ? Soldiers have been sent to educate the former serfs who are now armed to vanquish the foes of the Vozhd. Boyar rule has ended in central Russia but it is not enough. For the true Slavic nation to appear, blood will need to be spilled as the archaic and free Northerners and Cossacks must be subjugated and learn true Russian Narodnost !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.A;We follow the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.T;Russian Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.D;The Smolenskan Confederation that emerged from the independence has survived and achieved a transition into a Muscovite Confederation ruling over all of Central Russia. Many sought to extinguish the light that emerged in the West, preferring to keep the masses in serfdom and ignorance. But our Republic knows better, it is the era of the masses and we hear the lamentations from our cousins in the North and South who look up to us to realize the ideals of Freedom and Equality in the lands of the Rus. The road ahead will be tough, but a new Nation shall arise, one that will not repeat the mistakes of the past and unify the Slavic people of the East under one flag and one rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.A;For Liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.T;A stable principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.D;The enlightened rule of the Prince of Smolensk and his advisors in the Duma has maintained balance between the ideals of the West and the traditions from Russia. Only Smolensk could modernize Russia without upsetting what made the Russian identity. Masses are now being enlightened by their betters as it should be and while the worst Boyars have been deprived of their powers, all recognize the necessary role of the aristocracy in guiding the Grand Principality. Now the armies of the Rus must march once again to forge a new Slavic Nation in the East, against the unruly Cossacks and the archaic Novgorodians !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.A;Modernity will not sweep all traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.T;The Tsarina looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.D;The Grand Principality of Rus has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod. The grand princess Anna Lyapunova now rules alone over Central Russia, having reconquered her home and beyond while reforming the lands she holds. Boyars are now curtailed by the ever-growing state apparatus while the masses celebrate the ?tsarina?, a title evocating the brief rule of Ivan III and Zoe Palaiologos with whom the Princess has cultivated various ties. With her position secured and the support of the Russian people, Anna looks east and south across the steppes to acquire the land necessary to forge a new nation that could rise to the occasion and become a leading power in the East. Soon the glory of the Tsarina will be discussed over all Europe and all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.A;Long live Anna 'The Mother of Russia'!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.T;The Bear on the march;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.D;The Union of Muscovy has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod, with the Generallisimo Talantsev at her helm. The general has won over the support of the masses of whole Central Russia despite his foreign origins and lowly rank. The old hierarchies have been swept away as the Talantsev squadrons began to apply the new order across the Union. It is time now to look further than the current borders : the Volga has been the blood of Nizhny Novgorod for all its existence and shall become along with the Don the source of the new Russian Nation, as the Tatars are pacified and the lands christianized under the helm of the greatest conqueror the Russians have ever known! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.A;Long live Talantsev! For a more glorious Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.T;The Autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.D;Konstantin IV of Iaroslav has vanquished his enemies and reclaimed the legacies of Ivan III, Dimitri I and Feodor II ! An autocrat now rules over the unified Grand Principality of Rus, and never has it been such needed ! The nobility and the clergy needed to be reminded of their subservience to their sovereign while the masses had grown desperate at the hands of unworthy masters. Now the Autocrat sees all and balances the needs of the states justly. But it is only the beginning : soon a new nation will rise from the ashes of the old Russia and it only needs to bend the old Republic of Novgorod to the command of Konstantin to truly rule all the Russias. Then the Russian Crown shall look further west and south to begin the new power of Europe and Asia under the benevolent rule of the only one legitimate sovereign !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.A;Long live Konstantin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
##################### THE GIGANTIC BLOB OF NOVOGROD LOCALIZATION. GOD HELP EVERYONE. ##############################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.T;Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.D;Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.A;For Novgorod the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.T;The Uralic petition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.D;The Vyatka Republic is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs but Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws. Vyatka is a peculiar case of political integration, as Udmurt, Mari and Komi people live within its borders and enjoy a certain degree of citizenship rights. However, They are still treated as second-class citizens, despite their almost complete conversion to Orthodoxy. The Uralic people of the republic have petitioned the local Veche to abolish some long standing norms like discriminatory legislation for land ownership and military conscription. The spokesman of this group is Yevgeny Blinov, a russified Udmurt noble and patron of the first Udmurt publishing house, his wealth has attracted many Vyatkan officials to his side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.A;Vyatka will recognize the rights of its loyal citizens;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.B;This is a Slavic Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.T;Fate of the Mari Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.D;The Mari Confederation is situated in the no-man's-land between Tatary, the Novgorodian Confederation and central Russia. The Mari have fiercely fought against both Russian and Tatars, resisting attempts at conquest, colonization and conversion. There is no clear centralized administration in the area, but numerous tribe leaders have already converted to Orthodoxy and have made trade relations with Vyatkan their main source of wealth and power. When news came that Vyatka expanded the rights of the Uralic people living within its borders, including some northern Mari tribes, many chieftains wondered if they would not be better off joining Vyatka, and Novgorod as a whole or keep their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.A;Join Vyatka!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.B;Independence has served us well!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

There is no clear centralized administration in the area, but numerous tribe leaders have already converted to Orthodoxy and have made trade relations with Vyatka and Novgorod their main source of wealth and power. They have asked to join our Confederation as a new free state, and we have accepted. A Novgorodian embassy will create a Veche in Yoshkar-Ola and ensure our power stretches even farther!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS4.A;Let them join!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.T;The conscription law;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.D;The news of the integration of Uralic peoples in the Vyatkan Republic has created a negative reaction in Novgorod. While Karelians and other Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows. The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax and challenge the colonial attitude some colonists harbor towards the Uralic people. The northern volosts have asked the Veche how to deal with this large minority who have heard of the new Vyatkan laws. A new conscription law is proposed as a replacement for the yasak, which would establish Komi and Nenets units as military reserves and assistants for frontier outposts and isolated garrisons. Tyko Verigin, a representative of Samoyedic origin from the volost of Arkhangelsk, also proposes to give Uralic chieftains and elders the right to join local administrative assemblies, giving them a voice in the administration of their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.A;Savages do not deserve rights;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.B;The Conscription law strikes a compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.C;Rights are granted to the Uralics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.T;News from Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.D;Our new laws of integration for the Uralic peoples have created quite a stir in Novgorod, for the Veche has reaffirmed the discriminatory laws that we abolished. While autonomous, we still bow to Lord Novgorod the Great and keeping our laws could be poorly seen in the capital. On the other hand, it would be easy enough to write a sham law that would appease the republic while keeping the rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.A;We bow to our Lord of course…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.B;Our rewriting means nothing, we assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.T;Udmurt unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.D; Our refusal to grant rights to the Uralic people have created unrest within our small republic. The Udmurts and Mari living in Vyatka have started to resent the increasing discrimination caused by the harsh rejection of Blinov's proposals and strange rumors come from their territories, talking of seditions and troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.A;They can revolt. We are stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.T;Blinov's insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.D;The Udmurts have declared independence under the guidance of Blinov! A Confederation similar to the Mari has been  formed, with a political structure based on the democratic institutions of Vyatka. At the same time, the Udmurts reject envoys from Vyatka and have started harassing Russian garrisons. Many Russians in the countryside are escaping north or west, although those living in urban centers have been granted full rights. Vyatka must rally the various garrisons and march East to avoid a complete collapse of their authority in the hinterlands. Envoys have also been sent to Novgorod to ensure we get reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.A;Pesky Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.T;News from Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.D;Worrying news has reached us from our subjects in Vyatka. The small republic is facing an insurrection launched by the Udmurt tribes, who have grown resentful of the discrimination they face in their lands. They ask us for our support in quelling the rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.A;We will march against the Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.B;It is too costly to commit troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.T;War in Udmurtia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.D;The War against the Udmurts has been raging for several weeks already, and many fear that the Vyatkans aren’t strong enough to take care of this threat on their own. Following a rowdy session in the Veche and Council of Lords, it has been decided to send several regiments to the East to end the troubles and secure our trade again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.A;The forests will burn if needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.T;Defeat in the Votyak War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.D;As the Udmurts have secured their territory and defeated the platoons sent to defeat them, the Novgorodian Republic has been forced to recognize their independence to avoid any more financial losses. The defeat in the Votyak War proves the disastrous condition of the Novgorodian army and the administrative chaos of the confederation, which couldn't resist the uprising of mere disgruntled peasants. Valuable territory has been lost and communication with the Ural territories has become more difficult, as Novgorodians envoys and merchants must circumvent Udmurt territory to avoid customs or harassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.A;What has happened to us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.T;Victory in the Votyak war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.D;The Udmurts have been vanquished and their territory has been reintegrated into the republic. The end of the Votyak War proved that Novgorod still has an army capable of ensuring control of the confederation's territory, although many still doubt the capability of its leaders in the case of an actual conflict. The exile of Yevgeny Blinov and the closure of his publishing house has radicalised the few Uralic intellectuals, which along with rogue chieftains continued to stir unrest in the region long after the end of the uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.A;Nonetheless, it’s a victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.T;Fate of Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.D;Novgorod must decide what to do with Vyatka. The Vyatkan Veche has been replaced by a military authority, people flee westward and the economy is in shambles. Routes towards Siberia move northwards outside the territory of the Republic, the Vyatka river is too dangerous to navigate and the ironworks facilities are either in Udmurt territory or are being dismantled to be rebuilt in the Urals, where now they are more profitable. Two options are proposed: Vyatka would be reorganised under a military government becoming a stronghold against the attacks coming from the Tatars and the Uralic tribes or the Vyatkan Veche would be restored as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS16.D;”I went silent as this nobleman praised the institution of serfdom and the lack of worries the serfs enjoy. ‘The serf is the happiest man in Russia’ he told me. But I thought, as they do not feel worries, they can not possess families, feel affection, happiness or grasp other moral sentiments. They possess nothing, not even their life, and thus any of the natural rights that were unearthed after centuries of despotism by our philosophers” /n /n The son of a Novgorodian merchant in the Russian quarter of Copenhagen, Leonid Vorontsov, has published in Copenhagen a fictionalised voyage diary of a trip from Nyenschantz to Vologda based on his own first visit to his motherland, describing the inhuman living conditions of the Russian serfs. His work widely translated has also started again the debate on serfdom in Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS16.A;At least this book is only sold abroad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.T;The Serfdom debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.D;Novgorod is a collection of different political entities that have different legislations, especially regarding serfdom. Some countries or regions don't have it, like Yugra or the Pomor lands. Some have normal serfdom, like Novgorod’s core territory, and some have a very conservative and harsh serfdom similar to the southern princedoms, like Galich and Beloozero. There has been no major evolution in serfdom legislation for at least fifty years, but the percentage of serfs has been steadily increasing, as is the number of escapees to free territories.The debate launched by Vorontsov’s book has led to the abolitionists clamoring for the Veche and Council of Lords to take a stance on the matter. The main problem comes from the stark opposition between the Council of the Lords that oppose any law proposal, and the leader of the Veche, the Posadnik, Konstantin Levashov who has decided to push for an harsher abolitionist stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.A;Let them debate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.T;The first draft;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.D;The Veche has debated for several days the idea of a unified Muzhikate Code that would make the laws of the city of Novgorod concerning serfdom effective throughout the entire Confederation. Widely seen as a compromise as it doesn’t abolish serfdom and even could restrict some freedoms enjoyed in the northern territories or volotsks, it has drawn the opposition of the Posadnik who wants the Muzhikate Code to be amended by restoring old laws, especially the tradition that allowed serfs to leave their masters on the day of Saint Yuri. Regardless of the amendment, the law will go to the Council of Lords, that will oppose any form of Muzhikate Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.A;The first draft it is;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.B;Draft the amendment into the Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.T;The Muzhikate Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.D;The Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche has been accepted by the Council of Lords despite its members relying on serfdom for their wealth and position. Many believe this outcome to result from popular discontent towards serfdom along with the realization by some noblemen that gradual reform is better if they hope to keep power in the long run. Nonetheless, this law, while quite minor, will better the lives of the serfs in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.A;A small step;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.T;The Levashov Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.D;To the surprise of many, the Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche and amended at the demand of the Posadnik has passed through the Council of Lords. No one really knows how the game was played, or the reasons behind it, but rumours talk about how the Posadnik would have bribed and threatened the members of the Council thanks to citizen bands loyal to him. While the law will improve the status of serfs in the confederation, this move has greatly angered the boyars and the princes of Beloozero and Galich who now begin to scheme together and fragment the Republic even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.A;A victory, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.T;Veto from the Nobles;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.D;While the Boyars of Novgorod do not possess a power as great as the Slazchta in the Commonwealth, the Council of Lords can veto proposals from the Veche. Unsurprisingly, the draft demanding better living conditions for the serfs has been refused. While crowds have gathered to voice their anger towards the boyars leaving the Yaroslavl palace, there isn’t much that can be done to revert their decision. Only one person can act: the prince, but many fear that his senility will lead to the same result or worse. The law can also be abandoned: abolitionism while an important political debate in Novgorod is not shared enough amongst the wealthy and educated to be worth basing a political career on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.A;Postpone any further debates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.B;Ask the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.T;The refusal of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.D;Simeon Yemin was already old when he was elected to be Prince of Novgorod. But as years go by, his role, already weak in the political circles of Novgorod, has become one of a symbolic figure that appears in front of crowds, presides over some ceremonies and signs the necessary papers from his seat in the Yaroslavl palace in the centre of the city. Many claim the old man is insane or senile, while the ones who are close to him say that it is a façade he has built over the years to be tranquil. No matter what the truth is, the Veche's representatives have regretted asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince refused to overrule the decision of the Lords and then shouted at the Posadnik that he had interrupted his afternoon rest. With this peculiar event, the hopes of the abolitionists have been crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.T;The Most Glorious Code!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veche’s representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince not only accepted to overrule the decision of the Lords. He promulgated the Code with the Amendment, and praised the text to be the Most Glorious Code of the Republic. The nobles heavily criticized the prince, as many saw it as another proof of his lunacy and his influenceable state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veche’s representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The prince agreed to overrule the decision of the Lords if the text said that the law was passed on his initiative. While discontent with this state, nobles hardly could express anger as this was seen as one of the strange acts the prince performed and made him quite popular by many in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS24.A;Glory to the Prince, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.T;A speech at the university;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.D;For the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Novgorodian University, the President of the Fur Traders Guild Artemy Trediakovsky was invited for a speech. The Fur Traders Guild has been a major philanthropic and political association involved in all kinds of cultural and economical affairs for decades. Fur trade is now only one of the many economic activities of the guild, whose main focus has become the promotion of modern industrial culture and the opening of the Republic to the West. He talked for an hour and proclaimed that the city of Novgorod was the door to the West for all of Russia and that the right path for the Republic was the "enlightening marvels along the Narva''. He condemned the "mirages of the ancient times", that only had to offer "another thousand years of toiling" for Russian peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.A;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.T;Meanwhile in the Ural...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.D;On the other side of the country, far away from the comforts of the city, the Yugrian Confederation administers the lands of the eastern frontier. A federation of Cossack hosts, monastic communes, fortified villages and barely loyal Uralic tribes. Its only role is to protect Novgorod and its trade concerns from the raids of the Siberians. What was once was a barely cultivable territory plundered by slave raids and migrating hordes has recently started to become one of the richest territories in the Union. The Ural Mountains have become a major center of extraction for metals and coal, giving every man the opportunity to become rich if he's willing enough to toil in the mines or haul the goods to the Russian river network along dangerous routes. Most of the trade, especially fur, comes from Siberian tributaries or trade routes across the Perm pass, which is administered by the Fur Guild. This has of course caused many problems for Yugran traders, who are forced to pay a large tariff despite having moved within their own territory and often rely on contraband.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.A;And the problem is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.T;The Guild concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.D;The Fur Trade Guild has formally petitioned the Veche to legislate on the transit of goods crossing the Urals, following a loss of income as Yugran traders use contraband to circumvent their monopoly. This demand has been met with surprisingly large opposition as hostile guilds, representatives of the Yugran territories and even members of the clergy have united against the backward proposal that would create further barriers within the union and concentrate even more power in the hands of a few merchants in the city of Novgorod. The Fur Guild which funds half the liberal associations of Novgorod find themselves having to rely on their political enemies to protect their lucrative monopoly. In the Veche three proposals emerge: the first law would confirm Guild privileges, expand the number of border patrols and enforce the tariff. The second law would create a competitive market for the Guilds and the Yugran traders. Finally, the "Laptev Amendment'', proposed by a representative from Arkhangelsk asks for the creation of a national Siberian Fur Trade Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.A;The Guild shall keep its privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.B;Let the free market decide!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.C;Nationalize the fur trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.T;Monopoly confirmed by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.D;The Fur Trade Guild’s proposal has reached the Council of Lords, and was passed into law. Now the Guild has received the authorization to monitor the passes of the East and keep a close eye on Siberian trade. While a great move for the urban bourgeoisie of Novgorod, the law would create resentment in the East, and would provoke years of unrest and smuggling in Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.A;Let the furs... flow?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.T;Monopoly rejected by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.D;Surprisingly the Council of Lords has rejected the Veche proposal of confirming their monopoly and privileges. Many thought that the aristocracy would support the urban bourgeois since it would benefit them in the end, but past grudges between the two groups were too strong to overcome. It has become clear to the Veche, that Guild privileges have gone too far and that the riches of the Novgorodian eastern lands are being left unsold due to useless ancient privileges. The creation of a modern trading company, as proposed by the Laptevs, which may kickstart Novgorodian economy, gains support in the assembly despite the risk of angering one of the most powerful political groups in the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.A;The status quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.B;Let us petition the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.T;The Prince does nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.D;Years have done their work on Simeon Yumin who seems hardly fit to rule anymore. When the Veche representatives reached him, the old man refused to receive them because it would interrupt his sleeping habits, and only after one aide convinced him to host them, he decided to welcome them in his quarters. His response was as harsh as his first words had been: the amendment would not receive any support from him as he respected the traditions of Novgorod. The status quo will leave a bitter stain in Novgorodian politics as the Yugrans often continue to fight against the Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.T;The Prince supports the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.D;Years have done their work on the Prince of Novgorod, but he is still involved in Novgorodian politics. Following the proposal of the Veche to create a national Siberian Fur Trade Company, the Prince would decide to pass the Laptev amendment into law. While a profitable endeavor for the Republic, this action would necessitate heavy compensation to the Fur Guild who was to be absorbed by the Company and anger the aristocracy who had been sidelined.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.A;Thank you, old man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.T;A surprising action;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.A;A great move, but was it deliberate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.T;Free trade of furs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, de facto creating a competitive market in Siberia. The move greatly angered the Fur Guild who was nonetheless compensated for the loss of privileges, and it did not change much in the Novgorodian economy as the Guild was the main entrepreneur and still dominated the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.A;A wasted opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.T;Refusal from the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, which would have created a competitive market in Siberia. The only person capable of ending this deadlock is the ailing Prince of Novgorod, but members of the Veche have expressed preference to letting the status quo endure rather than having to face his unpredictable temper. The Veche could also ask the Prince for approval of a modified and moderate version of the law which also contains parts of the original Laptev Amendment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.A;Leave the old man alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.B;Go to the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.T;The Prince follows the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.D;The prince’s involvement has resulted in the moderate version being promulgated into law. Nothing noteworthy changes in Novgorod following this legislation and the Guild and its supporters consider themselves very offended by the recent attacks. No one is happy about this arrangement, as the Guild still retains an important power in Yugra and the rest of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.A;A waste of time and money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.T;The Prince enforces status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.D;The Prince has enforced the status quo concerning the Ural passes and tariffs, angering the Yugrian traders. Moreover it has led to new expenses for border forts in the East. Nothing noteworthy changes as the independent merchants continue to struggle against the Guild which is itself angered by the attacks it suffered in the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.A;Unity in Novgorod is no simple task...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.T;The decision of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.A;A surprise, but a good one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.T;The Lords refuse the Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.D;The Veche has asked for the creation of a Siberian fur trade company, only to have the Council of Lords reject the proposal. Debates are still going though, as Aristemy Laptev gathers several witnesses and various supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.A;What will happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.T;The Semyonov testimony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.D;Aristemy Laptev has taken the opportunity brought by the ongoing debate to denounce the unlawful practices of the Fur Merchants Guild, exposing their unlawful treatment of Novgorodian citizens in the north and in Siberian lands and blaming them for the misery of these naturally rich territories. The testimony of Vasily Semyonov, a Yugrian fur trader who lost an eye following an attack by Guild agents shook the assembly to the core. In the chaos of the revelation, a group of radical representatives in the Veche has started an overall attack against Guild privileges of all kinds, asking for the abolition of many ancient rights that hamper Novgorod's ascent into modernity, or so they claim. The Veche representatives must now propose either the dissolution of all the guilds or just focus on ending the Fur Trade Guild and then pass the proposal for the Prince for approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.A;The Veche votes on the dissolution of all Guilds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.B;The Veche only targets the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.T;Dissolution of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.D;Given the guilds' sudden infamy and the discovery of serious cases of corruption, the Prince easily accepted the Veche’s proposal and the backlash was limited. Many guilds eventually resurfaced as enterprises or associations within a solidified free market. The Novgorodian system has changed for the better according to many, and has become more western-like.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.A;Guilds were an hindrance to prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.T;The Status Quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.D;The prince has refused to end the Guilds, claiming they were an important part of Novgorodian society that could not be liquidated. Intellectuals resent Novgorod's unwillingness to abandon what they consider its feudal roots and eastern trade remains the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.A;Well, nothing changed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.T;The end of the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.D;The Fur Traders Guild was dissolved by the Prince following the Semyonov testimony, but it soon resurfaced under a new guise. Trans-Uralic trade ended up still heavily regulated and Novgorod-based merchants were able to keep the largest slice of the cake, leaving the Yugrian and Pomors in relative poverty. The liquidation was thus a radical move (and expensive) but it neither changed the situation for Northerners nor shook up the traditional status quo of Novgorod's trade regulations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.A;Well, this backfired...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.T;The Prince refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.D;The Prince has refused the proposal to end the Fur Trade Guild, preserving the status quo in spite of the recent revelations. Following this action, it appeared to most people in the north and east that Novgorod had once again taken a step backward, preserving ancient institutions to keep its aristocrats happy instead of choosing the interest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.A;Is it that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.T;A new proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.D;The Prince has refused the liquidation of the Guild and chose to enforce a competition regime, starting by granting a chapter to the Laptevs to create a new Fur Trade Company with a timed monopoly on Siberian and Arctic Trade. With their practises exposed in Novgorod the Guild is forced to reform and change its stances towards the Yugrians, and even start working with the Laptves. The economy of Novgorod is booming, and eventually the fur trade system becomes the basis for new enterprises in the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.A;A happy ending!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.D;Novgorod maintained control of the lower Ob river valley (also known as Kantekia) with the support of various Khanty and Mansi tribes hostile to the Sibir Khanate. While the southern tribes were under the control of the Yugrian Confederation, tasked with the protection of the Urals from Siberian raids, the northern tribes recognised the authority of a Prince, who had direct contact with a Novgorodian military governor. The Prince of Kondia (from the name of an Ob tributary) collected the yasak from the local Khanty-Mansi tribes, including some from the Siberian wilderness. By taking advantage of a period of political distress, the Prince of Kondia has become even more politically relevant. Some tribes in the south and the east have also gathered under his protection, defying their old Tatar or Cossack masters. The Princedom of Kondia is now, de facto, a vassal state of the Novgorodian Confederation and not a mere tribal institution to collect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.A;A worrying development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.D;We are forced to give lands to the Prince of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.T;The Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.D;For a long time, the inhabitants of the Russian Far North have met and mixed with Uralic people, Southerners fleeing war and serfdom, Cossacks and Tatars searching for new homelands, sects and monks looking for isolation and many adventurers willing to risk their lives in the Arctic Sea. Thanks to this varied influx of cultures and the proximity to the sea, the "Pomors'' have distinctive traditions and customs that make them unlike any other Russian community. Most of them are Povolniks, people who are not bound by constant obligations with any guild, princedom, monastery or boyar. The main center of Pomor culture is the port of Arkhangelsk. A group of Pomor intellectuals and merchants, including representatives from communities in Scandinavian territory have recently created the Saint Michael Brotherhood to further Pomor culture, economical and political interests. The organisation creates problems in Finnmark, as its local chapters alarm Scandinavian officials who are concerned about a growing Russian presence and influence in the area, but they also generate wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.A;Restrict the movement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.B;Accept their benefits and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.T;Developments in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.D;Recent events in Novgorod have started to strain the relationship between the Volosts in the North and the capital. Unlike Vyatka or Yugra, the popular assemblies of these territories are supervised by a governor sent from the capital. The locals have created a ‘Seven Volost Assembly’ gathered in Veliky Ustyug, under the auspices of salt and iron magnate Maksim Rogovich-Strogonov. They have formed a new entity under the name ‘Permyak Federation’, taking inspiration from ancient Great Perm and acknowledging Komi-Russian intermingling. Rogovich-Strogonov's immense influence in Novgorodian politics forced the recognition of his autonomous fief, of which he was chosen as the first Posadnik. Meanwhile in the farthest north, the Volost of Pustozersk refused integration into the Permyak Federation. This region is dotted with isolated orthodox monasteries, acting as intermediaries between the Pomor merchants and the Nenets tribes. From the chapter of Pustozersk, Archimandrite Tikhon gained the prerogatives of the former governor in Zapolyarnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.A;Two new states in the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.T;The Pomor Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.D;The Pomors have reached a point of no return regarding their relationship with Veliky Novgorod. After centuries of obedience and service, the people of the Russian Far North have decided to organise into an autonomous political entity within the Novgorodian confederation. No longer shall governors and city boyars hinder the decisions of the free Pomor people. This has been a painful decision, but following the birth of numerous Pomor cultural associations and their meddling with the politics of Arkhangelsk it had become clear that Pomor separatism was gaining the upper hand in the region. Secession talks are still frowned upon, but this separation will leave an ugly scar regardless. The prince of Novgorod can decide to nominate a prince when he promulgates the Founding Charter of the new state or let the Pomors govern themselves with fully democratic institutions like Vyatka and Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.A;nominate a prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.B;Let them rule themselves;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.T;Scandinavian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.D;Our annexation of Pskov and our refusal to part with Ingria has attracted the ire of the Scandinavians. Copenhagen sees us as a possible threat to their Baltic hegemony and has declared war on us with the intent to humiliate us and retake the coastline. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.A;We learnt from Nevsky !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.T;Utter defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.D;Not a single shot was fired in the end. Scandinavian troops walked in Karelian villages with the approval of the locals as the instability of the Republic has grown too strong. Our leaders were weak and divided and we pay the price for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.A;How could that happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.T;Victory in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.D;To the surprise of many, Novgorodians managed to fight back the Scandinavians, surprising their regiments in the cold forests of the North. The Republic was divided, but now it appears stronger than before, with the leaders of the Republic joining together for the cause. The victory of Novgorod has been deemed the new David and Goliath fight in Russia, and many patriots rejoice throughout the land for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.A;A glorious event !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.T;Defeat in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.D;Karelia was soon taken by the Scandinavians as our Republic could not manage to muster its forces efficiently against this stronger enemy. The divisions between our leaders have hampered our war effort and many people have grown disillusioned at the state of the Republic, especially the Pomors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.A;It’s just snow and trees though;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.T;The War for what ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.D;Karelia didn’t just matter to much people in Novgorod. After the various crises of the previous years, the question of holding on or not onto Karelia didn’t matter for many. Ultimately the Kremlin did not really care much than the rest of the population about deserted Pomor territory and was not willing to make it a national affair after the rough experiences of the previous years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.A;Why die for Karelia indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.T;The Glorious victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.D;Karelia may be empty land without a lot of interest but the war was seen as many as the last piece towards the rebirth of the united Republic. Soldiers fought for the unity of the nation and leaders temporalily set aside their grudges for the good of Novgorod. This ensured a victory against the master of the Baltic sea and one of the great colonial empires of Europe. Now is the time for celebration and the continued reconstruction of our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.A;Long live our Lord Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.T;Revanchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.D;The war for Karelia had mobilized every soul and body in the nation but it was not enough in the end. But as Karelia was lost, our national consciousness still endures stronger than ever. People are already enlisting and preparing for the revenge and reconquest of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.A;We’ll get them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.T;The massacre of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.D;Scandinavian victory was the natural result in their war against Novgorod. The armies of the Republic could not stand and defend the lands they had stolen from Scandinavia. Eventually Scandinavians breached the city walls and secured the Kremlin. As they intended to place another puppet Prince a bomb exploded and killed several men of a Norwegian regiment. In retaliation, the troops set the city ablaze, looting and killing on sight. Novgorod ended on this day, as the various states east declared independence and refused to let Scandinavians into their country. Copenhagen settled on influencing the rump states of Novgorod and the Pomors, securing their hold in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.A;What an horrible fate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.T;The miracle on the Neva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.D;Many thought that Novgorod would be forced to submit to Scandinavia after having annexed the Republic of Pskov. But the forces of the fledging Republic managed to fight back the foreign troops and securing their hold on the Baltic. Now is a time of celebrations in the Republic, as Scandinavia has also been forced to pay heavy reparations and admit the independence of Lord Novgorod the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.A;The world turned upside down !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.T;The defeat of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.D;The attempt by Novgorodians to challenge the status quo and take back the Republic of Pskov ended in defeat as Scandinavians managed to get back their territories and occupied large swaths of land in Novgorod proper. The Novgorodian prince was forced to go to Copenhagen to sign an humiliating treaty. Pskov was to be taken back by Scandinavia and the Republic would pay an enormous war reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.A;A shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.T;Scandinavian defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.D;The Second Neva War has ended in victory for Novgorod which managed to take back its Baltic Coast and force Scandinavia to recognize its independence. In addition, heavy war reparations were paid in exchange for the numerous Scandinavian prisoners trapped during the winter campaign and the end of occupation of the Baltic and Finnish lands of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.A;A glorious future for Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.T;Victory for Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.D;Scandinavia fought an hard war in Novgorod as militias from the whole Confederation flocked to the Baltic coast to defend their land. Even after countless victories on the battlefields, the spirit of Novgorod was never broken. When they entered the city Kremlin, the officials had fled to the countryside and led a guerrilla war. Eventually peace was signed with heavy reparations, but Novgorod endures as a strong country in Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.A;Peace without victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.T;Victory of Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.D;The Second Neva War had triggered a national awakening in the Republic as the people came together to fight the oppressors. Militias from the whole Confederation held on the Baltic fortresses and forced the Scandinavian armies to flee from their country. Huge crowds have gathered in the capital to celebrate the victory and public enemies like the Posadnik Levashov and the Prince of Galich Matveyev were seen together with the Prince to announce a reorganization of the Republic with a new Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.A;Long live Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.T;The Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.D;The Millennial Charter has been signed by representatives from the whole Republic, giving Novgorod a new written constitution following the national cohesion created by the war. The confederate nature of the republic is formally preserved, but the reorganisation de facto creates a federal system with a strong central authority under the helm of the Veche. Powers of the Prince and Lords have been reduced, while serfdom is gradually abolished throughout the land, although compensation for former owners are very expensive. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.A;A new millennium for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.T;Treaty of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.D;Our aim was to take back the whole Republic of Pskov, but the war took such a huge toll on our forces that many think it would be best to just limit ourselves to the Baltic coast as to not trigger another war in the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.A;We will be merciful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.B;We won didn’t we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.D;After a long and disastrous reign, Simeon Yumin, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died. Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation.\n\nThe Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached Novgorod yet. Dimitriy Matveyev, the Prince of Galich, and one of the most reactionary figures in the feudal faction, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.A;These are troublesome times;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.T;The Siege of the Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.D;After weeks of deadlock, the Prince of Galich has decided with the support of the military to take power. While the plot was largely successful as the troops took control of most of the city, the liberals and progressives barricaded themselves in the city Kremlin. Among them, Konstantin Levashov, the Posadnik and leader of the progressive faction, awaits the arrival of the Northerners and Siberians while hiding in the city Kremlin. The siege begins, with the Kremlin completely cut off by the troops of the feudal faction. Eventually, the Prince of Galich offers a final deal to the besieged: exile or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.A;Exile is best for the city...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.B;The Posadnik holds on;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.T;Death of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.D;Following the ultimatum from the Prince of Galich, the Posadnik Levashov convened with his followers gathered in the Kremlin and decided to accept exile. A white flag was hoisted from the walls, as the defenders walked out and passed before the infamous Prince of Galich who still kept true to his word and let them go without molestation. With the siege of the Kremlin ending and the exile of his opponents, the Prince is free to reorganize Novgorod as he sees fit. All pseudo-democratic institutions were reduced to mere formalities while the title of Prince was formally given to the Metropolitan. But all effective power has been transferred to a Committee of Ministers led by the Prince of Galich. Meanwhile the authority of Novgorod has crumbled in the North and East, as the Pomors and Uralics refuse to accept the new state of affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.A;Novgorod lives…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.T;The shelling of the Novgorod Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.D;The besieged liberals have refused the ultimatum of their opponents, prompting the shelling and destruction of the city Kremlin. The last pockets of resistance in the ruins were then cleared by the bayonet, with the corpse of the leader of the Veche, Konstantin Levashov found in the ruins. The oldest city of Russia is forever scarred and the whole Slavic world looks at those responsible for this tragedy with shame. The title of Prince, which prompted the whole affair, remains vacant as one by one domestic and foreign candidates refuse the blood-stained crown, leaving the feudal faction in disarray. The Novgorod confederation ends, as everyone thinks for themselves. The Princes return to their fiefs, preparing to deal with the incoming rebellion while the military command establishes a provisional administrative assembly and de facto takes control of the Novgorod region. Garrisons around the country are emptied as many defect or are called to the central territories to safeguard what remains of the city and its neighbourhoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.A;A sad end for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.T;Fate of the peripheries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.D;The throne of Novgorod is vacant, after a millenium of greatness, the city of Rurik barely controls the surrounding countryside. Novgorod has become a military dictatorship and the confederation has been dissolved. The Siberian delegates reach the city as it resembles more of a military barracks than the old capital. Their assembly no longer exists, the periphery has been abandoned. The shockwave of the collapse makes local institutions unstable, opening the path for commanders and conspirators to take the reins of the states left unguarded. The local Novgorodian garrisons can take control instead of retreating to the capital, or local boyars and noble with the support of the military can dissolve the democratic institutions, or simply informs them of the trying future that awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.A;Commanders take control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.B;A Prince is proclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.C;We will endure as a Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.D;The Prince of Novgorod has died, leaving behind a country more divided than ever. The boyars in the Council of Lords and the representatives of the Veche are unable to compromise on a candidate. In the baroque halls of the grandiose Yaroslav's Palace, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, a fight erupts among the delegates. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev of Galich accuses Posadnik Konstantiv Levashov of seeking absolute power for himself through populism and the bending of all institutional rules. The Posadnik replies by attacking the backwardness of the princes, whose hatred for progress in all fields is bringing the great republic down to the levels of its southern neighbours. In a final gesture of goodwill, all factions agree to convene for the first time in more than two centuries a Bishop's Veche, near the Holy Wisdom Cathedral at the centre of the Kremlin. The Metropolitan asks for a week of solitude and prayer before making his decision, hoping to find spiritual guidance through the Znameniye icon that saved the city multiple times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.A;Let the Holy Wisdom enlighten him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.T;Choice of the Metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.D;In the old times, the Metropolitan of Novgorod had been a leading political figure in the Republic, especially when weak princes came and went. With the decline of Unitarianism and the rationalisation of traditional political institutions, the religious head lost most of its influence, while remaining a respected national unifying figure even for Orthodox citizens. The old Metropolitan Dmitry, confirmed by Rome and Tver merely three years prior, had little experience with the city's politics, preferring the ascetic lifestyle of the city's numerous monasteries, yet he had no choice but to bear on his shoulders the confederation's future. He ponders his options: Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, a prominent and devout nobleman has the support of the aristocracy. Meanwhile, he could say he found no figure and propose a vote of the unified Veche. Or he could propose a vacancy of the office, leaving four years for the oppositions to die down. As he emerges from the Cathedral before the Veche he finally proposes.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.A;The Metropolitan proposes Chemiakin-Belsky for the Prince office;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.B;Count the votes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.C;The Metropolitan proposes to elect no Prince for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.T;The Cathedral explosion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.D;The Metropolitan announced his support for the feudal faction's candidate, Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, an affluent landowner from a minor branch of the Yaroslavl's Belsky known for his zealous patronage of church-building projects and traditional values. This decision infuriated the anti-feudal faction and made the delegates from Siberia and the North particularly uneasy given the Prince's zealotry. Right before the enthronement ceremony, boycotted by the opponents, a powerful explosion devastates the entrance of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, killing 24 participants including the Metropolitan. Vyacheslav survives, miraculously unscathed, and immediately blames his opponents. The Veche is dissolved via ukase while the ‘plotters’ are sentenced to capital punishment in absentia. In Staraya Russa, on the other side of the Ilmen Lake, the surviving members of the Veche pledge their loyalty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", a metaphorical way to refer to the City, refusing to swear fealty to a Prince. The two sides gear up for war to restore the "Republic".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.A;We follow the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.B;We follow Lord Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS73.D;The division between the feudal and anti-feudal factions have grown too much to amend without bloodshed. Now is the time to reunify Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.A;For the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.D;Prince Vyacheslav Novgorodsky, as he has been renamed, has won over his opponents, unifying Novgorod under his strong hand. Novgorod has become a princedom not very much different from his southern neighbours, especially Yaroslavl, and it seems that the ambitions of the Northern State will not stop at just unifying Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.A;Long live Vyacheslav!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.T;Restoration of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.D;Prince Vyacheslav has been defeated along with his allies by the free forces of the North and the East. The old republic is restored, with a sympathetic nobleman proclaimed as the new prince by the restored Veche. The Council of Lords has been curtailed however and the old princedoms of the Confederation have been annexed directly in retaliation for their actions. Novgorod is far from being truly united as the control over the East and North is not assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.A;Long live the restored Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.T;Change of allegiance;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.D;We are now a puppet of Novgorod as before;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.A;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.T;The Peace of Cherepovets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.D;The war has ended without a true victor. Novgorod is now reduced to the original city and the old feudal princes, while its former subjects in the East and North have become independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.A;An end to the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.T;The Bakers Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.D;After the Metropolitan categorically refused to assume the title of Prince or a new ad hoc equivalent, voting resumed. But the conflict amidst factions grew so violent that the bishop's Veche had to be dissolved and the Kremlin vacated with military intervention. Street fighting ensued between the City's Guard and supporters of the opposed factions. After a week of attempted restoration of control, rumours of incoming military columns from Beloozero and the South started spreading. Supporters of the feudal faction had already escaped the city when an anti-boyar pogrom ravaged the city. Posadnik Konstantin Levashov organised a makeshift "Five Kontsy Council'' to replace the de facto defunct Council of Lords and Veche. The "Bakers’ Coup'', as it was contemptuously called in the princedoms, marked the end of the "Old Republic". The reactionary states of the Confederation joined forces with a large section of the military command to restore order in Novgorod at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.A;The Republic must put down the princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.B;The Prince of Beloozero will safeguard our traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.T;The Novgorodian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.D;After weeks of pointless negotiation and preparation on both sides, Levashov formally declared the Princedom of Beloozero and Galich enemies of the confederation and prepared to end their continued independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.A;For the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.T;Victory of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.D;Beloozero has fallen and the republic has been preserved. Levashov nonetheless refused to disband his puppet Five Kontsy Council and has proposed the creation of a "Chamber of the Pyatinas" as a parallel assembly. The Council would legislate on Novgorod's surroundings, while the Chamber would deal with matters regarding the periphery. The Posadnik would remain a leading figure in both institutions, as they are filled with his own yes-men, but the states' autonomy would be respected, at least formally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.A;Our Posadnik knows the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.T;Posadnik’s choice;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.D;We accepted Levashov’s power grab because of the threat the feudal lords have portrayed, but now that Beloozero and Galich are vanquished, it seems that he will not be content with the way the republic worked. He has sent a message to all the members of the confederation to join the ‘Chamber of Pyatinas’ and to be integrated more closely into the republic. But at the same time, the old institutions that guaranteed our rights and a form of democracy have been side-lined, so we could refuse this new arrangement and go our own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.A;We follow the Posadnik...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.B;We won’t accept tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.T;The "New Confederation Charter";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.D;With the old confederation integrated and under the power of Levashov, the Posadnik has promulgated the New Confederation Charter that acts as the new Constitution of the republic. The powers of the Posadnik are near absolute, as he rules for life and can appoint at will the members of the various assemblies. At least Novgorod knows order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.A;Long live the Posadnik-for-life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.T;Reorganization of Novogorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.D;The Five Kontsy Council that led the city since the riots that followed the Bishop’s Veche has been vanquished by the princes and members of the military. Novgorod is pacified as the would-be Dictator Levashov lies hanged like a peasant inside the Kremlin. The city suffered another scarring event with a terrible repression, but order is now reinforced. A puppet noble, Roman Medvedev, has been selected as the prince of Novgorod, and the old institutions have been reformed to concentrate all real power in the Council of Lords, the true political body of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.A;Long live the aristocrats!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.T;Annexation of Beloozero;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.D;Fulfilling its political goals, Beloozero is ready to rejoin Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.T;End of the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.D;As the war dragged on, the free states blamed Levashov for having destroyed the confederation and the loss of liberties and rights they suffered. The East and North thus left, while the southern princes were also unable to defeat the Posadnik. His powerbase in Novgorod has been consolidated and he tightened his grip on the city and its surroundings. The Novgorod Republic now only exists on paper and the new Novgorodian state forged by the "New Rurik" is a completely new entity where power rests only in the hands of the Posadnik who rules for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.A ;A sad end for Novgorod...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.T;The Metropolitan prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.D;The last vacancy of the Novgorodian throne dated back to two centuries earlier and it coincided with partial Scandinavian occupation, leading some to think that the confederation had effectively entered its final days. Postponing the election of the Prince requires a supermajority in the joint assembly of the Veche and the Council of Lords. The feudal faction demands to vote for a new prince, knowing well that a vacancy would mean greatly expanding the prerogatives of Posadnik Konstantin Levashov. As the assembly nearly ends up in riot, the Metropolitan decides to take a decisive step to avoid the dissolution of the confederation. Against his wishes, he accepts the nomination as Prince. The feudal faction reluctantly accepts the compromise, hoping to be advantaged by a conservative leader. But the Metropolitan is politically incompetent and his desire to stay neutral leads to absolute prominence of the Posadnik. Only a few weeks after the election, the Council of Lords is dissolved by decree of the Veche, prompting division in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.A;An unexpected development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.D;The dissolution of the Council of Lords by the Veche has alarmed the southern princes, who fear that the new regime will restrict their privileges. The Posadnik Levashov has thus decided to declare war to restore order in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.A;Destroy the Princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.T;Victory of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.D;The Republic of Novgorod has vanquished the reactionaries of the southern princedoms, securing the role of the Veche and other democratic institutions. The first act of the reunified Republic was the long-awaited abolition of serfdom. But even victorious, the Republic has already fallen again in various political disputes, and it seems there is no grand vision of its future and its role amongst the various eastern Slavic states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.A;A victory nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.T;Feudal victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.D;As the Prince of Beloozero and Galich managed to win against the new Novgorod Republic, the confederation has reverted back to its old state: Levashov has fled abroad as armies marched to the city and the Veche has been purged, while old institutions like the Council were reinstated. The Metropolitan abdicated as the prince and the winners of the war chose Roman Medvedev, a weak nobleman as the new prince. The confederation appears frozen in its old derelict state, and it will not have the strength to rescind the rights of its constituent states, should a threat appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.A;A new situation in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.T;Failure of the republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.D;The white peace between the princes and the republic was seen as a shameful stain on the republic. Convinced that the urban bourgeoisie could not lead the republic to a strong future the various members of the confederation chose to leave and take their fate into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.A;The end of a political legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.T;Death of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.D;The death of the Prince of Novgorod closed a troubled parenthesis in the history of the Novgorodian Confederation. Veliky Novgorod, the Russian gate to the west, represented the tensions between two seemingly irreconcilable societies: a city of world-travelling merchants, sublime poets and Croesus-like lords living and voting side by side with the wretched of the Russian lands, the faceless human machines in the new factories or the wandering souls of the rural estates and arctic villages. Many Panrussian intellectuals thus look at Novgorod as the most desirable candidate for the unification of the Slavs. During the joint meeting of the Council of Lords and the Veche to nominate the new prince, many wanted to seize the opportunity to settle old feuds, notably the Posadnik Levashov. But in the end, his candidate, the weak Roman Medvedev, was soundly defeated by the Livonian noble Pyotr Gustavovich Litke, the first non-boyar elected to the office. Originally from Dorpat, he had made himself known in Novgorod for his anti-Scandinavian rhetoric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.A;Long live Pyotr Gustavovich!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.T;The nomination of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.D;The first obstacle to the rule of Prince Pyotr Litke was the cohabitation with his insubordinate Posadnik Levashov. Gathering allies in the Veche, Pyotr Litke helped the Prince of Galich and Levashov's main opponent Ivan Anisimov strike him down. Konstantin Levashov thus lost his title of Posadnik a few days after the election, but retained his seat in the Veche. The Prince now has the power to influence the selection of the next Posadnik, but he knows well that he must play divide et impera. Having been elected for his strong will and his distance from any major boyar clan, his role was to remove Levashov and restart the political rotation of the office between the factions. Litke has ambitions of his own and he knows that his supposed allies have little esteem of him, but at the same time he knows that to build his rule he needs solid foundations. The prince can either come to terms with Levashov and allow the election of Anisimov as Posadnik or let the ex-Posadnik and the Cossack smear each other freely in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.A;The Prince brokers a deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.B;The Prince stays out of it;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.T;Anisimov elected Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.D;After a series of meetings between the candidates and the Prince, the Veche elects Ivan Anisimov as the new Posadnik. The session was surprisingly calm given how Levashov's supporters had insinuated until merely days prior that Anisimov was a co-conspirator of a "reactionary coup". Many saw this event as a sign of the Prince's effective mediation skills and Levashov's acceptance of his downfall. But two weeks after the election, Levashov's political stances had completely reversed, bringing him back in the spotlight. He claimed that Anisimov’s “extremist and incapable" government was bringing the country on the brink of collapse and that only the guidance of the prince could bring Novgorod back on the right track. Even if Anisimov had only ruled for a dozen days, he had already attracted resentment from nearly all Novgorodian society for he was ambitious and idealistic, but far from capable. Once again, Pyotr Litke moved behind the scenes to broker a deal between two former archenemies: Konstantin Levashov and the prince of Galich Dimitriy Matveyev.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.A;What does the prince choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.T;The curtailing of the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.D;In a surprising turn of events, Prince Pyotr Litke openly addressed the Veche about the government of Posadnik Anisimov, deeming it "divisive" and "misguided". With the compliance of the reactionaries brought by Matveyev, Levashov's cronies and the disillusioned former supporters of Anisimov, the prince has bent centuries old rules with a simple speech. Not only had he curtailed the Posadnik as the most influential figure in the state, he had also greatly reduced the prominence of the Veche. With the Veche under control and Anisimov removed from power, the new Triumvirate of Litke, Levashov and Matveyev affirmed the control over the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.A;Long live the new Princedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.T;The Novgorodian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.D;Following his speech in the Veche, the prince gathered his allies to work on a constitution. Levashov and Matveyev old distrust and enmity was soon soothed by the diplomatic attitude of the prince. The three men agreed that Novgorod’s institutions were to be renovated. The prince would gain accrued power establishing a Western cabinet for affairs of state and becoming an hereditary office. In exchange for these concessions, the old Veche and Council of Lords would still exert power. Levashov obtained the minister of finances while Matveyev was chosen as prime minister with the support of both chambers, unifying the confederation once and for all under the rule of the prince and his two trusted advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.A;Long live the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.T;Political deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.D;Despite his actions, Litke was not able to find a common ground between Levashov and Matveyev, leading to a political deadlock. But the prince knew that he hadn't yet moved all his pieces. With the paralysis of government activities due to the political crisis many were starting to fear an action of force to restore order. The Novgorod garrison stands on alert, the prince of Galich has retreated to his estate while Levashov preaches to the mutinous capital about the sacredness of the ancient laws of Novgorod. The choice of the prince is now pivotal: will he ask the garrison to enforce order in the capital or leave the Kremlin and address the people to reassure them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.A;Gun the rioters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.B;There is no problem here;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.T;The military steps in;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.D;The outrageous order of the prince shocked the garrison, which was preparing for attacks from outside the city, leading to a general mutiny. Levashov made a last attempt to save his face and distance himself from the prince, but his position was too compromised. Both the prince and the former Posadnik were brought under arrest by none other than Ivan Anisimov and his Cossack guards. The war hero and popular leader Anisimov, rivalled only by his defeated nemesis Levashov, had discarded the mask of democratic kindness, choosing his favourite recipe to restore order and peace: with military discipline and ruthless action. While the two "conspirators" were allowed to rot into the prisons of the Kremlin, Prince Matveyev was not so lucky as even before he could reach his estate and prepare to march on Novgorod, he was gunned down by one of Anisimov's best men. The whole Novgorodian Republic was now ruled the same way it controlled the northern wastes: living in fear in the shadow of the barracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.A;Novgorod will know order;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.T;The Novgorodian autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.D;The prince found the crowd already energised by Konstantin Levashov. After reassuring them that there was no incoming army, Prince Pyotr Litke started attacking the Posadnik and his government for letting the situation slip out of their hands. Seizing the moment, he announced the dissolution of the government by decree and the creation of a princely council to restore peace and the "normal functions of the Council of Lords and the Veche", which were meant to convene right after the speech. By having the consensus of the masses and the army, the Prince muted all opposition and had opponents quietly sent in prison or to the firing squad. The survivors, including Matveyev and Anisimov, bowed to the Prince a few days later in the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, where he proclaimed a new "Act for Perpetual Peace" which de facto gave him total control over all aspects of government. The Republic died, as Litke assumed autocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.A;The end of our traditions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.T;Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.D;After days of inconclusive debate, the Veche is unable to elect a new Posadnik, as no compromise can be found between the conservatives, Levashov's faction and Anisimov's supporters. Government activity is paralysed and fights erupt in the streets between the various factions. With a dike left unwatched because of the unrest, a major flood devastates the eastern part of the capital, including Yaroslavl's Palace and the offices of the Posadnik. The lower class neighbourhoods take this as a sign and rise in open rebellion. The allegiance of the military is not clear and there are rumours of a general mutiny or a coup. The Prince is forced to lock down in the Kremlin, cut off from the outside world due to the incessant guerilla warfare around the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.A;This is madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.T;Unrest continues;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.D;The Prince still hides in the Kremlin, as the riot continues to engulf the city. The Citizen Guard formed by Levashov and the Cossacks of Anisimov rallied all men of good conditions, and restored order to the city. Now the prince must either turn towards Levashov, or heed the advice of Matyevev who has sent him a letter about restoring ‘order at all costs’.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.A;Accept Levashov’s call;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.B;Order at all costs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.T;Rule of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.D;Thanks to the last minute collaboration between Levashov and Anisimov, the rebels were pushed towards the devastated riverside where they had no choice but to surrender or fight to the death among the rubble. Sadly Anisimov was shot during the street fighting, leaving only the former Posadnik at the top to once again prove to be a godsend for his people. For a few months, Levashov continued to govern with emergency decrees while the two chambers remained inactive and the Prince and the Metropolitan were safely secluded to avoid undue interference with the business of government. When the situation came back to normal, nothing had formally changed in the structure of government, but it had become obvious that the confederation was now ruled by one man only with his clique of cronies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.A;Levashov played everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.T;Matveyev’s intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.D;The general uprising comes to a sudden end as news of an incoming military column starts to spread. The provisional Council of the Five Kontsy, assembled by Posadnik Anisimov with the last minute support of Levashov (tragically deceased after an ambush), had almost completed the pacification of the city with the help of the garrison's loyalist faction, when from Ilmen Lake came the troops of the prince of Galich. From the ruins of Yaroslavl's Court, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, he ordered Anisimov to surrender the city claiming to have been summoned by the prince to restore order. The exhausted citizen's guard had retreated north, preparing for urban warfare, with no intention to surrender. The garrison remains neutral, awaiting orders from the prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.A;Litke supports Matveyev;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.B;Litke contacts Anisimov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.T;The tale of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.D;The prince of Novgorod emerged from the Kremlin, confirming his support for Matveyev's actions and ordered the immediate disarmament of the "rebel militias". Meeting on the New Bridge, which had miraculously withstood the flood, the two princes organised the next political and military moves to ensure the pacification of the city and the restoration of order throughout the confederation. Their demise, however, unfolded before their eyes as Matveyev's regiment fell into Anisimov's trap. The two princes then tried to retreat to the Kremlin, only to find that the garrison had defected to the Posadnik, after Matveyev army’s terror tactics. The Battle on the New Bridge between Anisimov's Cossacks, the citizen's guard, and the garrison and the remnants of Matveyev's expedition force ended with a bloodbath and the summary execution of the two Princes. Hailed as a hero and the savior of the Republic, Anisimov declared the princedoms dissolved and in the following months proceeded to call the elections for a new Constituent Assembly to write a constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.A;Long live the hero of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.T;One Prince leaves, the other hides;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.D;After coordinating in secret with Posadnik Anisimov, the prince emerged once again to address the city, asking for relentless resistance against the coup of the Prince of Galich. Matveyev, caught by surprise, attempted to retreat away from the city, going as far as abandoning his troops to escape dressed as a monk, but the horrible conditions of the terrain and the swift action of the garrison stopped them on their tracks. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev was brought back to Veliky Novgorod, where he was publicly executed on the grounds of the Kremlin. Prince Pyotr Litke declared the dissolution of the princedoms and proclaimed the forging of a "New Union" on the ashes of the old one. With Anisimov's trusted men enforcing the Prince's will across the confederation, the city starts recovering from the recent devastation while a new Yaroslavl Court is being built to host the reformed Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.A;Long live Litke and Anisimov!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.T;The death of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.D;The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod, a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod.It has become clear to all, from the richest boyar to the most austere pomor, that the difficult and often tragic events of the last few decades have radically changed the structure of Novgorodian society who needs a new strong constitution. During the first phases of the election process for the new prince, the Russo-Livonian magnate Peter Casimir von Lütke was shot dead after accepting the candidature proposed by the conservative caucus of the two chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS105.D;The assassin of the soon-to-be-prince had disappeared in the shroud of the night, but he was suspected to be a petty criminal hired from the slums. The crisis paralysed the works of the assembly, as the moderates accused Posadnik Levashov of having stirred unrest in lower class neighbourhoods to start a revolt and seize power. Despite his vehement counter-accusation, this was the final nail in the coffin of Levashov's declining political career, leading to his hasty discharge. His emergency replacement was Prince Dimitriy Matveyev, assuming executive power not as Posadnik but as leader of the Council of Lords. Under common accord with the vast majority of the Veche and the Council of Lords, with the exception of few reactionary elements and die-hard supporters of Levashov, it was decided to reconvene the joint assembly in two months to write a new constitution, while a Transitional Council assumed temporary control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.A;Unusual but necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.T;The National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.D;After weeks of political deliberation throughout the city, the new Constituent Assembly presided by the prince of Galich was convened with members from the Veche and the Council of Lords. Within a few weeks of complicated negotiations, reformulation of ancient practices and innovative codification, the new constitution was ready and can only be described as...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.A;Populist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.B;Monarchic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.T;The new Popular Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.D;Despite the strong opposition of the most conservatives, it had become clear that the traditional prerogatives of the prince were an undue interference in the management of the affairs of the representatives of the Novgorodian people (with different ways based on class and census, of course). The head of state would become a symbol of national unity, as well as a moral and spiritual guide, overseeing the respect of the constitution from above the political games. Following the categorical refusal of Matveyev, it was decided as a compromise that the Metropolitan of Novgorod would always have this role, despite the timid opposition of the current office holder who was nearly forced to accept his new role. Despite this peculiar position, Novgorod grows closer to become a democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.T;The new Kingdom of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.D;The centuries old traditions have been preserved by the Assembly without sacrificing the progress made in the last decades. The new constitution has however disgruntled many progressives, who see the compromise as a grungy attempt to preserve the old power relations without bringing any real improvement to Novgorod's politics, and leaving the people without a real voice. The election of the prince has been preserved, but the powers of the office have been greatly diminished, having become redundant after the rationalisation of the relationship between the two chambers by the Constitution. Roman Medvedev has been chosen as Prince thanks to his bipartisan popularity and as a sign of compromise with the former supporters of Levashov, which had been his main political sponsor. He then unveiled the new Constitution of the Kingdom of Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.A;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

voc_annex_java_desc;The Terres Princières (Princely Lands) were three native states on the island of Java in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indies that were nominally self-governing under the suzerainty of the VOC, two of the major states were the Sultanates of Yogyakarta and Bantam. Their political autonomy was however severely constrained by treaties and settlements. The princely territories were successor states to the Mataram Sultanate and originated in civil wars and wars of succession within the Javanese nobility.\n\nThe Terres Princières have long been under our protection. It would be in our best interests to convince them to come under our direct rule, so we might bring civilization to their people more effectively, and so that we might secure their lands from other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_short_declaration_title;Introduce the Courte Déclaration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration (Courte Déclaration) was short and brief because it contrasted with the "long" contracts that were earlier concluded between the Burgundian Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands.\n\nThe latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Burgundian Indies government were met. The long contracts defined the limits of the competency of both rulers and the Burgundian Indies government.\n\nBy issuing the Short Declaration, we will declare these contracts null and void and we will bring the remaining princes under our direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_balance;The Burgundian East India Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voc_balance_desc;The East India Company since it's founding in 1600, eventually came to rule large areas of the East Indies with its own private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions of these areas. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333296.T;The Burgundian East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333296.D;The Vereenigde Burgundische Oost Indsiche Compagnie (VOC) has been described as a cabal of merchants with a state. One of the wealthiest organizations in the world, it has turned its economic might into political and military clout, exerting administrative control and military might throughout the East Indies. While only a small population of Dutch and Burgundian traders form the core population, the obscene wealth of this merchant class allows them to maintain an iron grip on what is essentially a private colony. The VOC is an economic juggernaut, and its merchants hungrily seek any opportunity to further their own fortunes, no matter what it takes. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333296.A;Greed is good. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333270.T;Burgundian Civil War  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333270.D;The ongoing struggle between the Jeanists and Parlimentarians has reached a boiling point, with the two factions reaching a state of open war and throwing Burgundy into chaos. While this poses a threat to the Company's assets in Europe, the collapse of state power provides an unprecedented opportunity to break free of Burgundy and declare political and economic sovereignty. No longer will we have to bow to Anvers - the wealth of East Asia is ours for the taking, and ours alone. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333270.A;Our time is now. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333271.T;Lack of Support for Local Princes ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333271.D;With the outbreak of war in Burgundy, our assets in Europe are compromised, cutting us off from material support and funding. While our wealth is immense, without vital infrastructure and industry we cannot hope to maintain our rule in the Indies for long. Already the local princes we rely on for administration and support are dissenting, with some even speaking of open rebellion. Without aid from Europe, our regime may rapidly collapse.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333271.A;Disconcerting...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333272.T;Rebellion against the Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333272.D;With the VOC cut off from European supply, their position is more fragile than ever. Already local soldiers have mutinied, with native troops storming arsenals and seizing arms. This is the time for us to strike back against our would-be masters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333272.A;Down with the foreigners! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333273.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333273.D;With the outbreak of war in Burgundy, the merchant captains of the East Indies Company have decided to make an ambitious move for independence. The colony is in chaos, with the Company leaders struggling to maintain their grip on the Indies.\n\ This presents us with a unique opportunity to gain influence in the region. We can send money and supplies to the native princes, aiding them in their conflict against the company and drawing them further into our influence. This move will certainly prolong the conflict, and further destablize the colony. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333273.A;Support the princes, let us break the Company's rule! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333275.T;Liberation of Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333275.D;After a prolonged struggle, we have overthrown the Company and stormed their offices in Batavia. Burgundian garrisons across the archipelago are surrendering or deserting in droves. With the collapse of European rule, the various princes of the region have met in $CAPITAL$, and pledged their support for a united Nusantaran state, with our nation at the forefront. With our forces combined, bolstered by seized Company weapons and funding, we have planted the seeds of a new united and modernized state that the Great Powers of Europe will be forced to reckon with.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333275.A;Freedom at last! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.T;Joining Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.D;With the Company defeated, a new Nusantaran state has been declared, claiming the entire archipelago. Shall we swear our loyalty to this new native sovereign? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.A;We accept, for a united Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.B;Never! We will maintain our independence. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333278.C;Upstarts! We must enforce our authority immediately! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333279.T;Intervention in Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333279.D;With our support, the local princes of the East Indies have revolted from the Company and established a new united state claiming the entire region. Thanks to our intervention, the new state has fallen into our influence and is reliant on us for economic support. The imperialists in our government seek to use this opportunity to claim further concessions and directly increase our presence in the region. The fledgeling state is in a weak posistion, and is unlikely to stand up to us. How shall we proceed?   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333279.A;Let them maintain independence, we are satisfied with our new ally. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3332790.T;Intervention in the East Indies Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3332790.D;With our support, the East Indies Company has put down the native revolts and secured its independence from Burgundy. The new state owes its existence to our support, and we have secured generous financial terms and trade deals as a result. The imperialists in our government are not content with this outcome, however, and want to use this opportunity to push for further concessions and direct rule in the Indies. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3332790.A;Let the bankers keep their independence. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333282.T;Die Groot VOC;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333282.D;With the rebellion against us crushed, we remain the undisputed hegemony of Indonesia. The local princes have been forced to kneel or been deposed, and the rebellious population has been cowed into submission. Our rule is once again stable, and commerce can resume with unprecedented efficiency. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333282.A;Excellent ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.T;Stabilization of the Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.D;While tensions had risen among the native princes and our situation was chaotic in the months following independence, our vassal rulers have remained begrudgingly loyal, and our rule has stabilized. The status quo has been preserved for the time being. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.A;The storm has passed. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.T;Burgundy Demands Submission of Princes ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.D;With the situation in Burgundy stabilizing, our European rulers have decided to take a more direct hand in the affairs of the East Indies, and demanded that the local princes report to them directly rather than through us. We are unable to contest this without provoking escalation, and this serves as a warning that our rule may be under threat from home.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.A;Ominous. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.T;The Traitorous Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.D;With the civil war ravaging our nation over, our attention turns to our former crown jewel in the east, which has outrageously used our moment of weakness to play at being kings of their own little fiefdom. These upstart merchants cannot be allowed to break free, and must be reminded that they exist to serve the crown! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.A;Demand their immediate submission! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.T;Dealing with the VOC ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.D;With the domestic situation stable, the attention of the crown has turned again to the East Indies Company. While their financial influence and worldwide wealth is unparalleled, corruption permeates every layer of the administration, and commonplace bribery and embezzlement are open secrets. We have let the Company exist on too long a leash for too long, and it is time to reign in these upstart merchants.   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.A;Demand they return to the fold. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.T;The East Indies Nightmare ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.D;Our once prosperous administration in the East Indies has collapsed. A native uprising has spread like wildfire throughout the islands, and the VOC offices in Batavia have been stormed and ransacked. Colonial administrators and merchants have been imprisoned or even lynched for their brutality towards the natives, and the local princes have united under a common banner. While we have little love for the Company as an independent actor, this threat to our interests in the Far East cannot be left unanswered.    ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.A;Prepare a punitive expedition. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.D;With Burgundy stabilized, Anvers has decided to reassert its global influence. Citing obviously false examples of rampant corruption at every level of the Company, the Burgundian government has demanded immediate dissolution of our colonial administration, placing our Company lands under direct rule of the crown and relegating us to a purely financial role. Accepting would mean the immediate dissolution of our holdings in the East and reincorporation into the Crown. Refusing would surely mean escalation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.A;We have no choice but to submit. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.B;We will not surrender our wealth and power! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.T;The Company Folds ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.D;In a rare moment of considering the good of the crown above their own profit, the VOC has agreed to our demands to relinquish control of the East Indies. The region will be directly administered as a crown colony, and the majority of company assets have been seized by the state. While the Company remains a powerful financial entity, their status as a semi-independent corporate nation has come to an end. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.A;Let them know their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.T;The East Indies Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but if we do not act it is likely another actor will take advantage of the situation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.A;Declare our support and protection over the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.B;The risks are too dangerous, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.T;The Burgundian Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but it presents the opportunity to gain a strong ally in the region and place the Company in our debt. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.A;Declare our support and protection of the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.B;This is too dangerous a move, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.T;New Foreign Sponsor ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.D;Through our diplomatic manoeuvring, we have found a new Great Power to sponsor and protect our fledgeling state. While some of our directors see this as trading Burgundian overlordship for another, this pragmatic move will help us maintain stability while we cement our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.A;The most pragmatic option. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.T;We Stand Alone ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.D;Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find a new European sponsor to protect us. While some scoff at the need for foreign overlords, without support from abroad we are in a tenuous position against Burgundy. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.A;Troublesome... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.D;The treacherous merchants of the East Indies company have managed to coerce another European power to protect them in exchange for influence. Our plans to reconquer them are in jeopardy, as to move now risks sparking a greater European conflict. We may continue to press our demands, but this would easily spiral into a greater war than we are prepared for. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.A;No matter - the Indies will be ours again! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.B;We will bide our time... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.T;Burgundy Withdraws ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.D;Burgundy has renounced its claims over the East Indies and we have forced them to acknowledge the independence of the East Indies Company. No longer bound to Anvers, we have secured our independence and our control of the East Indies! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.A;The spice will flow. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.T;End of the East India Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.D;After a protracted struggle, the East India Company has been forced to submit to us, and relinquish their control over the East Indies. Their colonial administration has been dismantled, and the region will be now ruled directly by the Burgundian government. With their primary colonial holding seized, the VOC's power has been broken, and they will never again challenge our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.A;They have learned their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.T;Future of the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.D;With our independence secured and Burgundy withdrawing from the East Indies, the time has come to consider the future of the region and our administration. One faction of the company believes that in order to survive, the native princes must be invited to form a modern government alongside the Burgundian administration, forming a native republic with a modern European foundation. A more reactionary faction believes that any level of reform is unnecessary, and that the Company can continue to rule as a corporate autocracy, run by and for the merchant class. While the long term stability of this move is questionable, the profit margin is undeniable. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.A;We cannot rule over a disenfranchised population - declare the Republic of Indonesia! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.B;We are free of all oversight - our wealth is all that matters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
