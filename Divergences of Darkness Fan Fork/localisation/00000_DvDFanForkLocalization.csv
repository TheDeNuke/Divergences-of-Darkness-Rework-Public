#####lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century that had been utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership. As such, Liberalism has never been seen as important as it was in OTL and unless another revolution were to occur it may never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#####500000.T;Venice wants to buy Durrës;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#####500000.D;The city of Durrës has a history of Venetian control. Interspersed with Serbian, Epirote, Anjou and Albanian control, Venice controled the city. Gained after the Fourth Crusade, but lost soon after. In 1392 the city was recaptured and only being lost in 1501 when the expanding Ottomans conquered the city. With the Ottomans gone, Venice is now looking to regain the city. Whilst we do need the money, it is clear that the loss of our major port would mean the influence of Venice upon our country would become even more massive. Were we to accept, soon, we will loose our independence all together.;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_fugger_fund_title;Partner with the Fuggers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
the_fugger_fund_desc;The Fuggers are a Danubian banking clan of enormous power who built their fortune on copper monopolies and the Tyrolean gold mines. Later generations used these funds to enter the banking business, eclipsing the Medicis in the 16th century. Since then they have become the go-to lender in Germany. The Fuggers have long been involved in the slave trade, helping Scandinavian and German merchants break the Hansa's Baltic stranglehold. Eventually the Fuggers became princes of the Empire. In short, the Fuggers are wealth itself. We need capital to start up our heavy industries, and the Fuggers are eager to expand into such businesses. With the right incentives - including non-competitive contracts to establish arms factories - the Fuggers can put their money towards building a stronger Germany. Perhaps this style of private-public industrial partnerships will become institutionalized...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DUAF1.T;The Binioù;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DUAF1.D;It was shortly after noon today when the Royal Court Orchestra participated in the Viel-Castel Festival in Angoulême, the birth- and deathplace of the Anglois composer Baron Auguste de Viel-Castel. His twelve symphonies, various individual pieces of military marches, and an unfinished opera have been praised by laymen and professionals alike and are credited to have fully established the role of the Binioù Cantorbérien, a special bagpipe which stands at the end of a centuries-spanning evolution of this instrument within the Dual Monarchy, combining various pipe traditions from Brittany and Ireland. The festival has brought this instrument into public focus for its pleasant sound and versatile functionality. Indeed, Edouard Pichon, a contemporary composer from Londres, enthusiastically reacted: "Every generation gets a chance to change the world of music; he [Viel-Castel] realized it for us. For a nation without melody is a nation without soul, and our nation's soul is one of vitality, carried by the purity and humbleness of this instrument of ours, the Binioù...";;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHFL1.T;Account on civilization in the West : The Incans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL1.D;”Although among the most uncivilized and barbarous of all the nations that dotted the vast continent of Ameriga, there was a certain gleam to the port city of Uraycusta that stood unabated from the dirt and grime that otherwise covered its inhabitants. The city was still slowly growing, depicted and showcased as a ‘New Cusco’. The city despite its obvious underpopulation was obscenely detailed, with buildings constructed in a careful manner, rather than fighting against the natural landscape of their surroundings, the Incans have built a city more complex than any other Native design I have seen. Its districts are spread in a gridlike pattern, with each area designed specifically for a particular industry. My journey took an unexpected turn with the arrival of the local official governing the city, a bonafide prince of the ruling Incan dynasty. He was obviously quite delighted with my presence, as he gave me my very own servant to take with me after my leave from the port. The only thing he asked in return was that I share my discoveries on the Inca, and give him some of my old, outdated manuscripts[…] My companion, Waman Poma, spends much of his time every evening tying a rope into intricate knots, colored and of varied orientation. When I asked the purpose of this, he told me it was a traditional method of remembering his home. It seems, despite their great organization, the Inca possess a spiritual side as well.” \n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL2.D;”The Duke of Tupac has welcomed my helper Poma and I with much enthusiasm, after assuring him that Poma was nothing but my trusted aide. It seems all is not well in Quito. My time here was spent trying to sort through the mess that is Caladeran politics. There seems to be no end to the various factions, cliques, and groups that all have attempted to either go against the Duke or convince him to join a specific side. Although nominally still under the King of Spain, there seems to be no love for Spanish rule among the locals[…] My aide Poma has taken a particular interest in the forward defensive fortifications of the Caladerans dotting the border with their fierce foreign rival, the Inca. Assumedly he has never seen such intricate and defined structures like these, as he has taken to drawing them with particular detail..\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL3.T;Account on civilization in the West : Yokohama;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL3.D;”Finally arriving at more familiar territory, I was glad to spot Burgundian colonial troops stationed in the local garrison at Yokohama. I saw the noble flag of Burgundy flying bravely as we entered the port from our long journey across the vast Pacific. My helper Poma has continued his complaints of nausea from the sea, much to my amusement. The local Burgundians were amazed and delighted to hear of my expeditions and were eager to showcase the treaty port that was the city. Yokohama was but a small fishing village before the Burgundians arrived here, establishing a grain of civilization. The locals are confused and amazed at the influx of European culture into their nation. There even seems to be talk of creating European-like sports leagues here! It seems in Asia there is still a modicum of decency to see.\n-Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL4.D;”The Jewel of the Japanese awaited me in Osaka. My helper Poma and I were able to catch a tugboat from Yokohama that was delivering fish to Osaka’s markets. The city was truly the center of the arts for Japanese culture, its streets were dotted with markets selling both beautiful artisan crafts and paintings the likes of which I have never seen in quite that particular way. The bustling and busy nature of the city is more like London or Paris than any traditional sleepy Asian city. The people are boisterous and seem to have a somewhat rivalrous relationship with other nearby cities and the people within them[…] In other news, my companion has continued his knot tying, which has begun to grow more feverish with intent as well as a hint of nervousness, as we intend to return back across the Pacific.”\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL5.T;Account on civilization in the West : Sanbao;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL5.D;”Sanbao was neither quite Asian nor quite Native. It was layered in grime, yet the people who called themselves Qingqiuanese were rather dignified in their mannerisms. Markets, inns, and brothels seemed to outweigh and outnumber the buildings used for traditional work. Within the deep heart of Sanbao however there lay a hint of their true origins and inner beauty. There were a small number of intricately detailed, beautifully crafted buildings that stood apart from all other structures. They seem designed to commemorate and remember the old lands the original sailors came from all those years ago. Despite all of this, combining both Asian and Native cultures, the people seem destined to wane and wither on their laurels. Decadence runs rapid through the city and without my aide Poma I would have gone quite mad with the constant bombardment of advertisements for, unsultry activities.” \n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL6.T;Account on civilization in the West : Mexico City;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL6.D;”A terse bastardization of both European splendor and traditional native engineering, it lacked in both. Mexico City seemed constantly on the edge concerning both personal capacity along with the ability to control the people themselves. Overpopulation seems to be a pressing concern for the city's continued development, officials have assured me efforts to remedy this are underway, to my skepticism. Although the populations' ethnicities are highly mixed they remain highly devout and devoted to Catholicism and it’s teachings. The city itself was interwoven as if designed and created on top of the old existing Tenochtitlan. Its largest structures above all else were their churches, which had stood proudly since the aged days of New Spain. There is a fervor in the air as their ‘Colombian Alliance’ against the Spanish is still celebrated and honored by the urban peasantry.” \n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL7.T;Account on civilization in the West : Spanish Cartagena;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL7.D;”A gleaming gem on the Spanish crown, Cartagena was a tropical, luxurious land that was dotted with mulattos and other types. Its people are split, the upper class and most Spanish of the mixed support the continued rule and submission to the Spanish. The mulattos and other lower classes are for the most part apathetic towards any ruler  Libraries, printing presses, and vast estates made up a majority of Cartagena at its center. The city had for a time been depressed, suffering from both plagues of the mind and body. Wars and disease had both taken their toll in the early XVI century. However since then, the territory has expanded rapidly, healing from those times and even growing to displace nearby rival Bogotá. The alleyways are cramped and full of life flowing from each step of the citizenry.”\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL8.T;Account on civilization in the West : Plantagenians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CHFL8.D;”New-Orleans combines both the planned organization of the Incas and the awful smell I thought I had left behind in Beornia. The city itself is no less than a tribute to arrogance against God himself. During my time there I saw no less than three minor storms that wiped out and tore down some of the smaller structures away from the city’s center. The planned architecture of the capital was absolutely necessary, as without the wisdom of their builders the city long ago would have been swept away by a rogue wave or typhoon. Just last year the city experienced another disaster that caused a large amount of damage. The government seems committed to the city as its capital however, its strategic importance and historical significance are unmatched by any other settlement in the nation. The people although quaint are kept quite beleaguered with the responsibility of the nation’s numerous slave labor. I cannot abide by the choice to keep those in chains, but when it comes to the New World and its… less civilized components, it must be seen as a necessity to keep a degree of order and civility on the continent.”\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL9.T;Account on civilization in the West : Septimans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CHFL9.D;”The Septiman capital was one of opulent luxury, attempting to call back to more civilized times in Europe. The land itself seemed sculpted to develop a perfect dockyard for maritime commerce. The port and its various functions were constantly receiving and shipping goods, their capacity stretched to the breaking point. Money seemed to flow freely in my time at the various theaters and ‘entertainment’ venues. The streets were newly paved, with a certain street becoming famous for its relation to both wealth and power. My aide Poma came close to breaking his neck, spending hours with it craned upward towards the larger buildings in the capital’s center[…] The people, ‘Septimans’ as they called themselves, are Europeans in all but name. The sister republics within their Republic, recently united into a single confederacy, fight and bicker like any ancient Greek polis.”\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL10.T;Account on civilization in the West : Vinlandics and the Skræling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL10.D;”Eriskhavn, the last city of Arcadia where a European flag still hails bravely over, is a meager city compared to what we have seen in our travels. The spirit of the first Vinlandic settlers still shines through in their descendants, dim though it may be. Still mainly built in wood, the city lies miles away from where the river Frysja meets the sea. Its city center is quite underwhelming, looking as one would expect a frontier settlement to. However, people there are hardworking, despite the presence of many ‘Skræling’, as the Indians are called. The Vinlandic people are a rugged and vigorous people, deeply committed to the land and its development. There is a sense of agitation all over as the settlers have become less attached to Copenhagen than a few decades ago. One can feel that the European presence is seen as a relic, and that is a shame for the various government officials who spoke to me politely and very courteously during my stay. […] We had seen plenty of sights on our travels together but the sight of the river Frijya nearly all frozen has caught my helper Poma by surprise. To see snow and frozen seas are a rarity in the South and one that often foretold of ominous doom.”\n\n -Last entry of Hugues Chancy’s Account on Civilization in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL11.D;”Arriving back home was not quite as triumphant as anticipated. There were of course several celebrations. For a journalist to cross half of the world and survive was still a testament to modern civilization. However, I was also harassed by local Burgundian radicals, angered by my outspoken support for Her Majesty the Queen. Most of these ruffians were harmless – save one who decided to settle his grievances with me by force. As I am a graceful man, this might have undone me, but I was saved by my good fortunes and forethought. My trusted helper Poma stopped the knife-thrust of my attacker with but a single outstretched hand, much to the amazement of the crowd. The ruffians retreated at once, and I was in debt to Poma for his assistance. All he asked was that he be allowed to return home. I did so without delay, paying for his voyage. To my surprise, traveling with Poma has been one of my most exciting adventures to date. Without him, I fear my travels would have ended long ago.” -Hugues Chancy’s editorial in the Anvers Chronicle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CHFL12.T;The account of Waman Poma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CHFL12.D;Four years ago a local official in the port of Urayacasta, a member of the Incan family dynasty, entrusted to a Burgundian journalist a man by the name of Waman Poma. A Quechua localman who was renowned for his strength. In return, we had received manuscripts that had helped our efforts at rapid modernization and industrialization. Now Waman Poma has returned, as the Burgundian journalist had returned to Europe following the conclusion of his journey. Waman Poma was brought to give his account of the expedition both to satisfy the curiosity of those interested in the wider world and for the more pragmatic purpose of learning new advanced technologies. With his account now recorded and disseminated we have gained a treasure trove of valuable testimony for the use and development of more advanced fortifications, infrastructure, and cultural development.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The recent large-scale blight had bought a significant hunger in the Irish counties, as well as small-scale across the Crownlands.In an effort to control the inflating prices in Ireland for grain, the Royal Lieutenant, François de Lally, forced the closure of Irish ports, as well as issued with royal support an edict for the grain harvests to be sold in the counties at the equal price of France's own produce. The grumbling Irish lords, faced with imprisonment if they awaited the reopening, have begrudgingly and slowly started to sell their cash crops back to the populace at the standard rate.When de Lally was put to question in parliament, he cited the witness statements from the starving German states, and how he 'refused to let that happen here'. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While much of his life is unknown apart from some unreliable sagas, and the Vinlanders of old gone, the figure of Leif has been hailed as a national hero since the times of the first settlers. With no precise day for the discovery except that it was fall, the date of Leif's Day was settled by the Vinlandic Parliament to be celebrated on the day before the anniversary of the independence of Vinland on the 17th September. All years the 17th and 18th September are days of celebrations and pride for all people of Vinland.

SCAF9D;Hugo MacDonald has been a point of cultural pride recently for the Scottish people, as this rather, unknown writer has taken the Lowlands by storm with his book, 'The Scots Chronicle' on the changes of Scots vocabulary over the years, the heritage of Scandinavian phonetics, and his personal effort to 'correct' such heritage away to the original phonetic sounds.\nAlthough this should be simply a regional moment of pride, the book & Hugo MacDonald have been a cause that the Scottish Nationalists have been more than willing to wear, and as the days pass, the Scottish cause has only geared into a full revival....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRGF1D;Charles de Fourcroy, born in Luneville, Lorraine, has finally written his 'magnum opus' after decades of petitioning everyone from universities to dukes to sponsor his writings. Charles has always endorsed the belief that the conflict between Burgundy & England-France is a conflict 'between brothers & family', and has always supported a 'Union of Franks'.\n\n'Francolangian: An International Language for all Franks', is the work of said writer, detailing the history of both Burgundian & French languages, it then translates further on, into a detailed dictionary & sentence-creation in his personal, artificial hybridized language, Francolangia, in which he says will 'solve the conflict & history of all Frankish speakers for centuries', He's even started to call himself a Francolangian to support the 'Pan-Frankish' case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRGF2D;The Wassland System (or, Four-Crop System) has been a staple of our agricultural revolution since it's full enactment in the 1740's by an enthusiastic Royal Decree. Alongside the various exponential support programs of Dutch & Brabantian agricultural advancements being endorsed across the entirety of Burgundy. These systems gave way to increased food security, urban migration & the development of national markets within Burgundy.\n\nIt could be said, that these programs led to Burgundy's own, Industrial Revolution just soon after the Plantagenet's realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUSF1.T;History of Russia from the Earliest Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF1.D;Mikhail Godanin has eventually published the last of the 31 volumes of his History of Russia, considered by many its magnum opus. Son of a former serf, Godanin managed throughout his life to rise through his academic brilliance and his knowledge of the new Western historical methods. His History of Russia is notable for its disdain and refute of the so-called Normanist theory. Many Western historians who had worked on the history of Russia before had noticed the importance of the Northmen in the build of the Rus. But Godanin has demonstrated that this was but a Scandinavian fabrication: Riourik he affirms was a Slav or a Finn, but not a Northman. Moreover, the Russians were already building their own state, and the Rurikids only unified and accelerated the historical process despite the marauding Varangians. This book has become the new Bible of the intellectuals in Russia and has helped nourish the already existing bad blood between Copenhagen and the Eastern Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF1.A;Our past is glorious and Godanin allowed everyone to learn it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF2.T;New Jerusalem Monastery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The church has spent a great amount of money on its construction, and in addition to the grandiose architecture, it now houses many relics revered by Russian Christians. It is rumored that the supreme hierarchs of the Church even think of bringing the Holy Sepulchre here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While dictionaries and gramaries have been written by erudites from Novgorod or Muscovy, most are contradictory and it is time that a dialect be chosen as the national language, spoken by all Russians, be they from the Dyke Pole, the city of Novgorod or the numerous villages of Veliky Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF3.T;The Russian Beard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF3.D;A new fashion has emerged in the higher level of societies in the past few years. Whereas for nearly a century, the Russian boyars always were clean-shaven, many have chosen to grow the beard again. This social custom was never mandatory despite the rumours that some fools in Western Europe wrote that the Princes in Russia had their nobles forcefully shaven.  It was merely an attempt from the Russian elites to grow closer to Western aristocracy following their European tours in the late XVIIIth century, and allowed them to differentiate them quite easily from the common folk. Now the beard is seen as a Slavic symbol, showing that the elites have not abandoned their roots and understand the glory of the Russian people and its past. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

##### Avignon Crisis ( Coded by DeNuke and Localized by Zerzura )##############;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.T;Triumph in Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.D;Our invasion of Tuscany was a risky gamble, but luck seems to finally be returning to the House of Valois-Medici. The Tuscans have been reconquered, and for better or worse their elites have accepted our return. Of course, the first order of business was to reassure all of the local lords that they’d be able to keep their powers and privileges so long as they cooperated. The acquisition of Tuscany opens up the rest of Italy to our grand dynasty, and the methods of integration we have practiced here will go a long way towards helping us bring more of Italy under Valois rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.A;Italy shall belong to the Valois-Medicis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.T;An Argument in Marselha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.D;In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War that raged through Italy, Tuscan monarchists crowned a cousin of the King of Provence as Duke of Lucca in an attempt to offer up Lucca to our dynasty in exchange for surrendering our claim to Tuscany. However, our monarch refused to accept this deal and so Lucca has existed in an awkward situation for years. Now, we have attempted to persuade the Lucchesi Valois-Fourcalquiers to return to our fold, but they seem unwilling to listen. After inviting the Duchess of Lucca to Marselha to argue our case, she retorted that Lucca was “not an appendage of Provence.” The argument ended with the king declaring that he could take Lucca “at dawn and be sitting down for breakfast in the Palazzo Ducale with the sun barely risen into the sky.” Unsurprisingly, the duchess departed Marselha shortly afterward in poor spirits. A confrontation with Lucca – and whichever backers it manages to acquire – is now likely imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.A;As if Lucca could find anyone important enough to back them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.T;Provençal Threats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.D;A recent diplomatic incident involving the king of Provence and our own duchess has now escalated to frightful proportions. Lucca was given to the Valois-Fourcalquiers to placate the King in France’s desire for Tuscany. Now the House of Valois is now pressing its claim to our duchy, and if we cannot find anyone to defend us then our independence may be lost. The main hope now is to turn to the Pope for assistance. The Comtats of Avignon and Venaissin have for centuries been a sword of Damocles hanging over the Provençals – a form of Papal insurance against their adventurism. Now we have called upon the Holy Father to dismiss their claim to Lucca and hopefully mobilize political support across Italy against them. If the Papacy has lost their influence in Avignon, however, then we may be out of options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.A;Let us pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.T;Showdown in Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.D;For centuries, the House of Valois has claimed both France and vast swathes of Italy, even though they only controlled Provence. However, the recent Valois-Medici seizure of Tuscany – and the pugnacious nature of the “King in France” – has sparked a crisis between them and the Valois-Fourcalquiers-ruled Lucca. The Lucchesi ambassador explained that the Provençals, after a diplomatic row with the duchy, are now attempting to press their old claim to it. Obviously, Provençal expansion in Italy would be a disaster, but ability to prevent it hinges upon use of the Pope’s influence, especially our enclave in the Comtats of Avignon and Venaissin. If for some reason the Pope’s authority, in Roma or Avignon, has dissipated, then there is little we can realistically do to stop the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.A;We cannot allow a Valois Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.T;An Unfortunate Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.D;To the embarrassment of our ministers, it seems that our political situation makes it infeasible to protect Lucca from the Provençals. At this point all we can do is steel ourselves for the new tide of war which the foreigners shall surely bring to the rest of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.A;God have mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.T;The March on Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.D;The Lucchese attempted to call upon the Pope to organize a coalition of Italian states against us, but this foolish endeavor died on the vine. With Lucca defenseless, our sovereign made good on his threat and launched a rapid conquest of the duchy. Soon enough, the Lucchese royal family fled, our king was having his morning breakfast in the Palazzo Ducale, and the city-state was added to our domain. With our position in Italy consolidated, and all our regional rivals divided, the way is clear for the full restoration of the House of Valois-Medici in Italy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.A;Another step on the road to glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.T;The Lucchesi Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.D;The Valois-Medici conquest of Tuscany was bad enough, but their aggression towards Lucca threatens to draw the whole of Italy into war. If we do not take a stand against the foreigners, then the states of the north may soon pass into foreign dominion once more. The Holy Father and his advisors have put their minds together and developed a plan to contain them. We shall first demand that the Provençals stand down and concede to the illegitimacy of their claim to Lucca, effectively dooming any chance of the Valois-Medicis continuing their Italian expansion. If they refuse, then we shall excommunicate their king and set the restoration of an independent Tuscany as their penance. Meanwhile, we will organize a coalition of Italian states to prepare to oppose Provence on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.A;The Valois-Medicis must be expelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.B;On second thought, I never liked Lucca much, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.T;The Pope Dismisses Our Claim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.D;The Papacy has long opposed any effort by our great dynasty to expand its power within Italy, and they show no sign of changing any time soon. At the urging of the traitorous Fourcalquiers, the Pope has declared our claim to Lucca to be illegitimate! This announcement has already stirred popular agitation between Catholics and secularists. While it seems that His “Holiness” may be willing to tolerate our presence within Tuscany alone, accepting his intervention would amount to giving up all further aims in Italy. If we press on, however, then the Pope will likely escalate the situation. Excommunication and a military confrontation could both be on the table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.A;And how many divisions does he have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.B;Perhaps we were not meant to rule Italy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.T;The Unthinkable Reply;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.D;Provence has flatly rejected any attempt to annul their claims! This unprecedented defiance has sent all of Roma into an uproar. If the Provençals will not see reason, then we must resort to harsher measures. His Holiness has now proclaimed the excommunication of the “King in France,” placing Provence under interdict, and has demanded the immediate evacuation of all Provençal possessions in Italy. If they refuse once again, then we will have no choice but to make manifest the wrath of God upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.A;How dare they question the Lord’s representative on Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.T;The Papal Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.D;Our rejection of Papal intervention was not received well in Roma. The Pope has now placed the Kingdom of Provence under interdict. While the announcement was dressed up in flowery language, this is obviously an extortive measure to compel us to abandon Italy. If we do not wish to see Tuscany fall under Papal control, and our ambitions in Italy die an ignominious death, then we shall inflame the Catholic and Italian worlds with our defiance. It is likely that the Pope would muster a coalition of Italian states against us – none of their rulers seem to realize the benefits of enlightened Valois-Medici rule. As a precaution, we would also need to pressure the Public Council of Avignon to declare independence, in order to shore up our defenses against the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.A;Alea iacta est!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.B;This was all a misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.T;A Mistake, Corrected at Last;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.D;The Public Council has finally broken the Papal stranglehold on Avignon. As it would not do to have an independent state in the middle of our territory, we have taken the liberty of sending in a column of troops to restore order in the city. After hundreds of years, the blight within the center of Provence has been wiped clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.A;Not a day too soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.T;Rebels Storm Avignon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.D;The Protestant fervor sweeping our lands has greatly animated the southeasterners, who have long endured the onerous presence of the Papal enclave of the Duchy of Avignon. This unsightly product of feudal machinations has stood for centuries as a symbol of Papal interference amongst the Provençals. Now, at the encouragement of local agitators, multiple groups of Provençal rebels have descended upon Avignon. The ducal garrison hurriedly escorted the religious authorities out of the city through a series of old siege tunnels, spiriting them into Torino as Avignon fell into anarchy. It is expected that the duchy will soon request annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.A;We should have expected this. The Pope won’t take this well…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.T;Avignon Petitions for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.D;With the clerical authorities cast out of Avignon, the Public Council bowed to the pressure of the rebels. They first declared independence, before submitting an official request for annexation to our government. At this point it would cause more political chaos to refuse than to accept – the city is, after all, essentially under occupation by crowds of Protestant zealots. However, the reaction from the Papacy has been one of rage. Retribution from Roma will soon be forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.A;Let us enjoy reunification while we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.T;Trouble in Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.D;Our unsanctioned elimination of Valois-Medici Provence has greatly angered His Holiness the Pope. For centuries, Provence existed in a state of uneasy equilibrium with the Papacy and its Duchy of Avignon. The Pope and the Medicis may not have been on friendly terms, but Provence kept Avignon stable. Now the violent destruction of the Provençal nation has plunged Avignon into turmoil and the duchy is likely to collapse. Already, reports are coming in of Provençal agitators calling for the storming of Avignon, and many ecclesiastical personnel have already been evacuated to Roma or Turin. If Avignon falls, then the Pope may take extreme measures to protect his influence in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.A;This is ridiculous, it’s just one city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL21.T;Avignon Falls into Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL21.D;The Anglois annexation of Provence has left Avignon-Venaissin completely surrounded by them. This led to the people of the Comtat demanding the end of Church rule and the annexation of Avignon-Venaissin into the Anglois realm. With a mob of villagers surrounding the meeting house of the Public Council, they were left with no choice but to declare independence from Rome. But even this was not enough, as shortly after the measure was passed, the mob overpowered the guards and stormed inside! The Public Council has been seized as enemies of the people, and while a local noble has declared himself "Count of Avignon-Venaissin," at this moment there is no longer a true government here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL21.A;Freedom, whatever its form!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.T;The Fall of Avignon-Venaissin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.D;The Public Council of Avignon-Venaissin, faced with an angry mob threatening the realm, declared independence from the Papacy. Yet this was not enough to appease them, and our soldiers arrived to find the mob running wild through the comtat. We put down this chaos, but the complete collapse of the previous administration left us no legitimate authority to place back in control. Therefore, we have occupied Avignon-Venaissin, awaiting whatever retribution the Pope shall bring against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.A;What a mess…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.T;The Avignon Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.D;The Comtat of Avignon-Venaissin – a Papal possession since 1348 and one of the main defenses against Anglois or Provençal expansion into Italy – has fallen. All order in the comtat has collapsed, its clerical administration has fled, and the enclaving power has annexed it. His Holiness the Pope is beside himself with fury, as this is both a grave insult to the Church and a dangerous sign of French designs on Italy. To address the crisis, the Pope will invite Italian representatives to the town of Anzio to form a coalition against this intrusion and lead a military response. Avignon may have fallen, but Roma must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.A;Gather the banners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.T;Formation of the League of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.D;The fall of Avignon has enraged His Holiness the Pope, and has sent a wave of fear across Italy. The duchy was typically seen as a check on western aggression into Italy, and its loss augurs ill for us. To defend against this new threat, the Holy Father has summoned representatives from across the Italian region to the Papal town of Anzio, to form a political and military alliance. If we join then we will be expected to fight against the foreigners when the time comes, and our connections to the Papacy will deepen. Rejecting such a proposal will not only harm our relations with the Pope but may endanger our independence if the alliance goes to war without us and fails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.A;We shall send a representative to Anzio and join the League.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.B;Our soldiers are not Papal condotierri!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL25.T;Formation of the League of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL25.D;News has reached us of the Pope organizing a coalition of Italian states against us. Representatives from across Italy convened in the town of Anzio to form a military alliance aimed at removing our ability to “threaten” Italy. This is absurd slander – we are, of course, in no way a “threat” to Italy – but several nations throughout Italy have rallied to the Pope’s cause. A war for the fate of Italy is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL25.A;They shall not defeat us with mere numbers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL26.T;The Tuscan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL26.D; The Provençal invasion of Tuscany was a brutal assault upon the freedom of the whole peninsula, and their crimes against Avignon cannot go unanswered. Now, the time has come at last to confront the Valois and drive them out of Italy! The League of Anzio has been assembled, and we have all prepared our forces for the struggle against the Provençal menace. As armies from the Alpine foothills to the shores of Terracina march towards Firenze, they go with the knowledge that they are the only defense standing between their homelands and the Valois tyrants! We shall be the end of Provence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL26.A;Avanti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL27.T;The Tuscan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL29.T;The End of Valois-Medici Italian Ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL29.D;The greatest tragedy since the coming of the Plantagenets has befallen our once-proud dynasty. The League of Anzio has conquered Tuscany and forced us to render it up to them, spelling the end of all our claims in Italy. All Italian elites who had previously sworn fealty to the rightful King of France have now repudiated their vassalage and broken away, and Tuscany proper has been placed under Papal control, for the Holy Father and his advisors to determine its fate. With our tremendous weakness, and the continued Papal interdict against us, there is nothing to stop the hated House of Plantagenet from attacking us now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL30.D;The Valois-Medici have been cast out of Italy! The armies of the League of Anzio swept into Tuscany and liberated it, before driving all the Provencal forces back over the Alps. The King of Provence, fearful that the Dual Monarchy might take advantage of their weakness to strike, conceded to our demands to relinquish Tuscany and forfeit all Provençal claims in Italy. Tuscany is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will need to decide its fate. Unfortunately, Avignon seems to be permanently lost, but the end of Valois-Medici ambitions in Italy was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL31.D;The defeat of the Provençals by the League of Anzio has resulted in several punitive terms being imposed upon Provence.

Our forces entered Roma, Lucca, and the other cities of northern Italy in triumph. Sensing the prevailing political winds, many Italian elites have sworn fealty to the king in Marselha, while others find their realms descending into turmoil. More and more Italians are beginning to speak of the House of Valois as the best hope for Italian unification, and the new laws passed by the Estates General to protect local Italian codes and customs will go a long way to supporting that argument. Italy has never been closer to our grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Provence is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will soon need to decide its fate. Unfortunately, neither the residents of Avignon and Venaissin nor its old administrators seem disposed towards resurrecting the comtat, but the punishment of the Occitan heretics was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Facing overwhelming defeat, the leaders of the League were forced to back down and recognize Occitan independence. Furthermore, the Pope himself has declared the extinction of the Kingdom of Provence, rendering all Valois, Plantagenet, and Serna claims to it null and void. After centuries of persecution, the Occitan people are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Dual Monarchy’s destruction of Provence opens the way for further Anglois aggression into Italy, and their crimes in Avignon cannot go unanswered.

All our claims to the old bastion of the House of Valois have been annulled, and Provence has been placed under Papal control, for the Holy Father and his advisors to determine its fate. It will take a long time for our people to forget this profound humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL41.D;Avignon has been avenged! The armies of the League of Anzio swept into the Anglois domain and liberated all of Provence. The king of the Dual Monarchy, fearful that separatists might take advantage of their weakness to strike, conceded to our demands to relinquish Provence and all of their claims to it. Provence is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will soon need to decide its fate. Unfortunately, neither the new residents of Avignon nor its old administrators seem disposed towards resurrecting the duchy, but the punishment of the Anglois imperialists was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL42.T;Triumph over the League of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL42.D;La victoire est à nous! The machinations of the Pope came to nothing – his band of brigands was shattered by the might of the Royal Anglois military. Facing overwhelming defeat, the leaders of the League were forced to back down and recognize our annexation of Provence. Though certain Valois and Serna nobles abroad maintain claims to the kingdom, and the incident has struck the first sparks of a Provençal nationalist movement separate from the Occitans, the Italians shall not raise their hands to contest our rule of the southeast again. The Hundred Years’ War is finally over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL42.A;The ghost of the fourteenth century has been exorcised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.T;The Fate of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.D;With Provence now in our hands, there is the question of what to do with it. Occupation has been ruled out due to the exorbitant costs involved – even restoring Avignon-Venaissin would result in establishing a territory whose local population would be overwhelmingly hostile to its existence. Therefore, we have two options. The first option is to return Provence to the House of Valois, on the condition that they waive all claims to lands outside of Provence proper and accept a constitution curtailing royal power. The second option is to bestow Provence upon its Aragonese claimant of the House of Serna. Several advisors have objected to this idea, worrying that it would place Italy under the threat of a new tyrant, but it would certainly put Aragon into our good graces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.A;Restore an independent kingdom of Provence under the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL45.T;The Donation of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.D;A truly unexpected windfall has just graced the Kingdom of Aragon, courtesy of His Holiness the Pope! The House of Valois-Medici, former rulers of the Kingdom of Provence, were driven out, only for the new occupiers of Provence to earn the ire of the Papacy. The Pope then marshalled northern Italy under his banner in the League of Anzio and succeeded in seizing Provence proper. Unwilling to rule it himself, and distrusting the other claimants, he has bestowed the entire Kingdom upon our House of Serna! Provence stands ready for a suitable relative to be named its ruler under Aragonese overlordship. The entire court is jubilant at the news, though the king seemed utterly shocked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.A;He was overheard muttering about the need to start attending church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.T;Avignon Rumors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.D;The shifting political situation in western Europe has seen its ripples reach an unexpected place : the Comtat of Avignon-Venaissin. Formally a possession of His Holiness the Pope, the troublesome enclave has long been a refuge of commerce, minorities, and enemies of the Crown. However, word has reached Marselha that the situation in the comtat is reaching a crisis point. Increasing numbers of Provençal nationalists are pushing for the territory’s incorporation within our nation, but the Pope has made it clear that such an occurrence would be unacceptable. Nobody knows what will happen next but all signs point to Avignon’s days being numbered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.A;A tense situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.T;The Collapse of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.D;It was not surprising to hear that Avignon’s government had been overrun by Provençal nationalists. With unrest threatening to boil over within the city, the ecclesiastical and military authorities, along with the local aristocracy, fled the duchy in droves. As a result, Avignon was seized by Provençal loyalists who have now petitioned for annexation. The flight of the ruling class gave us little option but to accept, yet this incident has enraged the Pope. Rumors swirl that he may goad the Dual Monarchy to attack us in revenge…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.A;We shall stand ready to face the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.T;The Pope Denies Our Claim to France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.D;The Papacy has long opposed any effort by our great dynasty to expand its power, and they show no sign of changing any time soon. At the urging of the Plantagenets, the Pope has declared our claim to France illegitimate! This announcement has already stirred popular agitation between Catholics and secularists. We have now gone too far to turn back and must press forward for fear of popular revolt if we retreat. Preparations for war against both the Anglois and the Pope must be made, and part of that includes a preemptive strike upon Avignon-Venaissin. The road ahead will be rough and arduous, but if we prevail then we may be able to finally conclude the Hundred Years’ War in our favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.A;To Avignon we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.T;The March on Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.D;The Comtat of Avignon, while possessing some fortifications, has never been able to withstand a siege completely surrounded by hostile territory. Our forces were able to quickly surround and storm the territory with minimal loss of life. As of now, the Provençal flag flies over Avignon. Now, we must prepare for the inevitable Papal retaliation – one which shall likely include the Plantagenets as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.A;The calm before the storm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.T;The Ultimate Insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.D;The day long feared by Papal authorities has finally come to pass : Provence has launched a preemptive strike on Avignon, rapidly overrunning and occupying the comtat. The news of this unprovoked assault has enraged His Holiness, who immediately decreed the excommunication of the King of Provence and placed the kingdom under interdict. He went on to declare the title of “King in France” to be illegitimate and has instructed the Papal legate in Paris to solicit Anglois aid. In fact, the Holy Father has gone so far as to declare the Plantagenets to be the legitimate kings of Provence, and it is expected that the legate will urge the Anglois king to invade immediately. All of these maneuvers have upset liberal Catholics within the Papal States, who do not look fondly upon the Pope using his temporal and spiritual powers for overt political actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.A;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s : render unto God that which is God’s. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.T;The Drums of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.D;The response from Roma to our seizure of Avignon was immediate. First, the king was excommunicated and the entire nation placed under interdict : now, no Provençal citizen can receive communion or partake in any other Catholic rite. The Pope then declared the very title of “King in France” to be illegitimate and proclaimed the Plantagenets to be the sole rightful rulers of Provence! Catholics across Europe have now turned against us, reactionary politicians accuse us of heresy, and the Anglois armed forces are rumored to be mobilizing. Our influence across Italy has collapsed, and we should prepare for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.A;The Hundred Years’ War continues to haunt us all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL54.T;The Weakness of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL54.D;Recent events in the southeast have opened up an opportunity. Provence’s baseless claiming of the French throne, and their seizure of Avignon, have stirred His Holiness the Pope to take action. After placing the Kingdom of Provence under interdict, his papal legate in Paris has appealed to us to invade the Valois-Medici domain. Declaring the House of Plantagenet to be the sole legitimate claimants to Provence, the Pope has urged us to finish off our old rivals. This is an excellent opportunity, but if we are currently in a crisis of our own then there is no reason that we cannot postpone Provence’s destruction to a more suitable time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Declaring the House of Plantagenet to be the sole legitimate rulers of Occitania, the Pope has urged us to restore our control of the southern lands. §RThis is our best chance to bring order back to the Midi and vanquish the unruly Protestants.

VAL58.T;The Dissolution of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL58.D;The dramatic shift in Roman political conditions has resulted in the catastrophic destabilization of the Comtat of Avignon. With the Pope no longer in firm control and regular contact with the enclave, the territory is becoming a battleground for ethnic and sectarian conflict. Therefore, we have decided to dissolve the government of Avignon and impose direct rule, pending deliberation on the territory’s future. While our ministers are divided as to the best course of action to address the issue of Avignon in the long term, all of them agree that abandoning the duchy to anarchy is not in anybody’s interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL58.A;Better us than the mob, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL60.T;Assuming Control of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL60.D;Since its purchase from the Neapolitans in 1348 AD, the Comtat of Avignon has been the most distant possession of the Holy See. Now that we have acquired Roma, we have inherited the Pope’s rights and responsibilities towards the territory. However, we may not necessarily want to continue administering an enclave in the middle of Provence. We should therefore consider if it might be more advantageous to sell off Avignon to a suitably friendly and responsible buyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL60.A;We must consider this topic with care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.T;The Sale of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, the overlords of Avignon, have decided that keeping the duchy under their control is no longer in their interests. They have thus come forward with an offer to allow us to purchase the territory, since it was originally purchased (from the Neapolitans) in the fourteenth century. Considering how politically dangerous the territory has been over the years, the ability to easily obtain it should not be scoffed at. Nevertheless, several of our more bellicose ministers believe that we should simply seize it by laying claim to it and preparing a military campaign. However, these men are in the minority, and most urge our head of state to accept the offer. §B(This will cost roughly 100000)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.A;We should not pass up this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.B;BUY back our rightful land? Ridiculous, prepare the troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL62.T;The future of the League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL62.D;It is now time to decide the future of Tuscany, and with it the course of Italy. The League has served its purpose and can be disbanded, with Italy restored to how it was in 1836, however there is an opportunity here. The League has shown what a unified Italy is capable of and with everyone still celebrating, maybe we can propose the creation of an Italian Confederation. This Confederation will have His Holiness as the leader and each member state, while not independent, will have great autonomy within this Confederacy. Some opponents feel that this idea is doomed to fail, they say the Confederation will be too decentralized to push for Italian unification or even effectively defend itself. Regardless, if this idea is to succeed then we must have Milan agree to become a member state. Without Milan the other Italian states will most likely refuse and the Confederation will not be strong enough to fight off any other foreign powers, such as Aragon, who would be angered at the creation of a strong Italian state. Should we make the attempt and contact Milan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL62.A;Send the offer to Milan they are the lynchpin to this Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL62.B;This Confederacy idea is sure to go south. Restore Italy back to its 1836 borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL63.T;An offer of Confederation from the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL63.D;We have received an interesting proposal from the Pope following the defeat of Provence by the League of Anzio. His Holiness is proposing that we should join him under a new Italian Confederation. As a member of this Confederation we will be granted various rights to govern our country as we see fit, but it will mean the end of our independence. The ultimate goal of this Confederation will be the eventual unification of the Italian Peninsula under the Pope's rule, free from the influence of foreign powers except for that of God. However concerns have been raised whether or not the decentralized structure of the Confederation can allow this goal to be reached. Should we agree to this Confederacy plan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL63.A;His Holiness will cleanse Italy of foreign influence. §R(Game Over)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL63.B;We fought in the League to protect our independence and will not surrender it to the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL63.C;We will join and ask for a role in their government. §B(Switch to PAP)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL64.T;The Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL64.D;A new day shines over Italy - with Milan's agreement we have announced the creation of the Italian Confederation. Other members of the League of Anzio are already applying to join our new Confederacy. His Holiness, the Pope, has taken his rightful place as our head of state. We have taken the first step towards a united Italy but we must stand strong as various powers will surely try to stop us and keep the remaining Italian states under their control. If we play our cards right we can not only expel all foreign powers, but bring the love of God to all the peoples of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL64.A;Nitimur in vetitum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL65.T;Milan refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL65.D;Unfortunately Milan has refused our idea for an Italian Confederation. Without them we must abandon our plans and restore Italy back to its 1836 borders. As much as holding onto Tuscany would be appealing, there is no way the great powers of Europe would tolerate this course of action. Perhaps one day there will be a proper Italian nation, but we fear what that nation will do to the Pope's temporal rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL65.A;Requiescat In Pace, Confederatio.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL66.T;The Unfortunate Conquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
VAL66.D;The collapse of Provence to our forces has somehow resulted in us also taking over Tuscany. As we cannot directly control Tuscany proper without having the pope decide that it would be apt to start a holy war against us, we have restored the Grand Duchy to what it was prior to the creation of the Etrurian Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Now that we have restored our control of France, it is time that we give them a taste of their own medicine. Our sovereign shall be reanointed, and all the Medici loyalists driven out. The royal court, which was forced to relocate in a chaotic scramble to escape the advancing Medici army, shall return in grand triumph to Paris, the crown jewel of civilization and the capital of humanity. Let this be a humiliating lesson to all who would challenge the undeniable supremacy of the House of Plantagenet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

integrate_bretons_desc;For over a thousand years, the Bretons and the French have lived side by side, throughout the rise and fall of multiple dynasties. During this time their culture has become quite like our own, and they have grown connected to many French communities. Our dynasty’s failure to secure victory in the War of the Breton Succession in the fourteenth century, and thus keep the Dukes of Brittany loyal, could be considered our first major defeat during the Hundred Years’ War. Let us correct that mistake and ensure that the Bretons will remain a steadfast and valued component of our domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

clean_up_italy_pope_desc;One of the greatest errors in European history was Frankish king Pepin the Short legitimizing the Pope’s slow takeover of the region surrounding Roma. Ever since 756 A.D., the Pope’s temporal power as ruler of the Papal States has kept Italy fractured and weak for his own benefit. This can no longer be tolerated.

clean_up_italy_genoa_savoy_desc;The two main powers of northwestern Italy, Genoa and Savoy, both threaten our efforts to unify Italy for different reasons. Genoa’s maritime and economic power, while a sliver of its medieval might, is nevertheless a rival to our hegemony.

INC1.T;The Inca claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.D;Quiso Yupanqui was destined to rule the Inca empire as the first born of Huascar III. However his cowardice in the battle of Lima saw him discredited at court, many blaming him for the defeat. He was thus exiled and his uncle Huayna Capac IV was crowned in his stead. For 11 years we have hosted him in Camelot, granting him a small allowance but recently he has grown restless about taking back the throne of the Inca. Reports talk about unrest from the chieftains following the reforms of the Imperial court, and the ilness of the usurper. Quiso has demanded we help him arm his supporters so he could take back what is ours, and ensuring a more friendly, if not open to new ideas neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC3.D;The coup has succeeded. Quiso himself slaughtered the usurper and his son despite the formidable defense of the Chinu guard and its commander, the Ronin Oishi Chikara. All administrators were interrogated, with the Qingqiuan Yiang Jujiu minister and first preceptor of the Prince executed for betraying the Empire in favour of the foreigners. The country soon rallied around his true ruler who has promised to uphold the natural balance of the Andine society, reverting several modernization reforms of his predecessors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC4.T;The Great Andine Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.D;The Inca empire in the Andes is suffering from a great famine following an outbreak of potato blight. Potatoes have suffered in the past from diseases, but never on such a scale and the inefficient and closed governement of Quiso Capac has only worsened the situation. All around the empire the peasants turn to the God of the Sun to relieve them of their pains but so far no sign of amelioration has been seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC6.D;As the famine spreads to Antisuyu the port of Uraycusta, the "gate of the Empire" has seen the local Aimara inhabitants riot against the foreigners accused of harboring grain to make a profit. The Qingqiuans, the more numerous were the most hit with the Chinese quarter reduced to ashes with hundreds of its inhabitants. Japanese and Anglois traders were also targeted in the attack, the crowd nearly attacking the diplomatic quarter before the intervention of the local police and foreign guards opened fire on the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC6.A;Will the disasters never end ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.T;Opportunities in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.D;The disastrous administration of Quiso Qapac has led to a grave famine in the Andes. The empire of the Inca is weakened as bodies pile throughout the Andine villages and their soldiers are weakened by their hunger.

INC10.D;The conquest of New-Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that they had 'saved' the Aimara inhabitants of the Southern Andes from the famine. New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions as they hosted several foreign communities, and shipments of food flooded the port. However the campaigns outside never saw much of it as Beornian bureaucrats took lands by force from the inhabitants. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accaparate land for future colonization with countless tribes pushed to the North. When the Beornians did not act, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC12.A;Beornia has nothing to excuse for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.T;The first Imperial assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.D;One of the reforms pushed by Pachacuti II was the establishment of an Assembly to represent the people of the Empire in governance. It first convened in $YEAR$, with a Lower Chamber elected by the various Ayllus of the Empire and a Senate appointed by the Emperor. The campaigns voted by villages with no individual votes cast, while in the Imperial cities only those who payed the 'poll tax' could vote. The first Inca constitution while deeply influenced by the European and Japanese models, retained several of the particularities of the Empire and established the so-called era of the 'advised Sapa Incas'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.A;The voice of the people is the will of the Inka!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.T;The gate of the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.D;Following the loss of the Inka homeland to the Spanish, the Empire strenghtened its hold on the South. In the southern valley of the new Antisuyu the bay of Uraycusta was first developed by Dongese who had acquired trading privileges following the establishment of the Chinu guard. Following the crossing of Land's End and the treaty of Bordeaux that saw the Anglois gain access to Potosi silver, Uraycusta grew even further. Eventually by the XVIIIth century and the arrival of the Japanese traders in the region, it had been nicknamed the 'Gate of the Inca' by outsiders as this was the only port accessible to foreigners. The reforms of Pachacuti targeted the city the city plan was reorganized and the city was given self governance like the Imperial capital, free from the Southern Apu (governor) as to encourage foreign investments and settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.A;Let the world come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.T;Rice farming in Antisuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.D;Rice was brought to the knowledge of the Inca following the arrival of Dongese merchants and adventurers in the late XIVth century but cultivation was sporadic as few Ayllus and administrators wanted to cultivate this new plant. But in Antisuyu the climate has revealed itself as a good match for the plant and the Asiatic and Qingqiuan presence in the city meant that the cereal was in demand. In the 1840's Pachacuti II, who was a well known consumer of rice, developed great infrastructure projects to enlarge the production of rice in the South. This effort led to an increase of food that allowed the Empire to avoid disaster during the Potato blight of the late 1840's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.A;Rice for the people (and the Inka)!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.D;The only diplomatic tool that the Empire had following the conquest of Cuzco was the great silver mines of the Andes and especially Potosi. While payments to the Spanish were stopped as soon as the Colombian wars began, the Anglois fleet still continued to come every 4 years to take its due. Pachacuti II arranged following his coronation for a diplomat to be sent to Paris to end the treaty to show its regained independence. The Anglois accepted as their reliance on silver had been reduced thanks to Atlantian and Qingqiuan gold flooding the markets with only the payment for $YEAR$ to be done. Now the Silver fleet has left the port of Uraycusta for the last time, with a day of celebrations in the empire for the end of European colonialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.A;Tawantinsuyu will not be exploited anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.D;The Dual-Monarchy had gained access to the Potosi silver in the XVIIth century, securing payments of silver in exchange for guarantees of the Inca Empire continued independence. As silver became less of a necessity thanks to the various Gold rushes, the interest of the Silver fleets declined for Anglois elites. Following the accession of the new Incan emperor Pachacuti II, diplomats agreed to end the old treaty of Bordeaux in exchange for a last shipment and preferential relations with the new 'civilized state';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.A;It was good while it lasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.T;The Great Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.D;Before the arrival of the Conquistadors the Incan economy was not based on individual property and markets, but on the basis of reciprocity between individuals, but also inside the Empire as a whole. The corvée, or mit'ma, was in theory based on the fact that in bad times the emperor would help the communities who worked for him. This system was brutally changed by the Conquest and the spread of European thoughts as the chieftains acquired more lands from the community for themselves. Pachacuti invested several administrators to the creation of a modern cadaster and the end of nobility hegemony on land possession. The mit'ma was also formally abolished. The Ayllus were left with a choice : the lands were divided between the various families of the villages or instituted as common land possessed by the entire village. A mixed system of landowning prevailed after the reforms, granting far more power to the peasant communities than before and ensuring a greater food production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.A;Lands owned by communes, what a strange idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.T;Feeding the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.D;The various reforms of Pachacuti and the adoption of foreign and modern agricultural techniques allowed the Empire to grow far more food than before, accompanying the growth of population. The Empire while not controlling the food market as before still exerted great influence over the merchants, instituting maximum prices during times of hunger and ensuring redistribution of food for isolated communities in periods of drought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.A;Our people is fed and growing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.T;Ending the colonial system;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.D;The reconquest of old imperial lands up to Quito proved to be a major problem for the Empire of the Sun. The economy was controlled by the Granadan and catholic Quechua elites who abused the rural communities to gain more wealth. In the same time the Catholic faith proved to be hard to manage as bishops rallied the masses against the 'Heathen invaders' adoring idols and devils. To counterract both of these problems, the land reform that had been instituted in the Southern Andes was extended to Peru, with the resisting landowners being put to trial or even murdered in riots where the injustice was the worst. Meanwhile the Catholic masses grew less poor thanks to the Inka, securing the loyalty of the rural communities. The land reform disrupted the economy of the Central Andes for nearly two decades as production had to be reorganized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.A;Colonization has ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.T;Renew the Chinu alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.D;The relations between the Qingqiuese and the Empire of the Sun go back to the XVth century when a Dongese ship landed near Quito, bringing the lost Chinese colonists in contact with their first non-hostile state after the disaster of Acapulco. Soon after disgruntled mercenaries from Dong Guo arrived to settle in the empire bringing variolation, gunpowder and mettalurgy to the Empire and forming the 'Chinu Guard', critical to the continued independence of the Inca Empire. After his accession to the throne Pachacuti II sent several ambassies to San Bao to rekindle their long friendship and secure a renewed alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.A;The Alliance must be reforged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.B;We don't need the Qingqiuese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.T;Embassy from the Empire of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.D;The Inca empire was the first non-hostile state the Chinese colonists encountered in the New-World, with Dongese ships avoiding the coast of Mexico following the slaughter of several crewmen in the bay of Acapulco. The Inca Empire brought food and ressources to the lost colonists, and many settled there, with also plenty of sailors marrying with Quechua women during their trips. The new era of Pacific navigation in the XVIIth century allowed the Qingqiuese to transport the Inca silver to China, greatly securing their trade adventures and ensuring the development of Qingqiu as it exists today. The reasons for allying the Inca are numerous and their ambassadors are ready to sign it as soon as we want it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

humala_mission_desc;The Humala Mission or Humala Embassy was an Inca diplomatic journey to Japan, initiated in $YEAR$ by the Imperial court. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Inca and the establishment of lasting relations between the two Empires of the Sun. It was first proposed by the influential head of the Chinu Guard Oishi . The purposes of the mission were twofold: To negotiate commercial treaties to increase trade in the Pacific and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from Japan who was considered as a model of successful and independent modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC23.D;In $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ hosted the Humala mission, an embassy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that aimed to negotiate new trade treaties and gather knowledge to assist them in their modernization. The chief of the embassy, Huascar Humala received an imperial audience and attracted great attention during his stay. While not the first Quechua to set foot in the Home Islands, nor the first embassy sent by the Empire of the Sun to the Empire of the Rising Sun, it sponsored growing ties between the two powers and became a symbol of their modernity for the Japanese elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC24.D;By $YEAR$, the Inca state had transitioned into a dominated monetized economy. The economy minister implemented the creation of a paper-money backed by the huge silver and gold reserves gathered over the centuries.

INC24.A;Let the money flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.T;Religion in the new Inca state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.D;The cult of Inti, the sun god, has been the basis of the Inca religion since the foundation of the Empire. The emperors claim descent from Inti, with an old legacy of inbreeding to keep the blood of the god pure. Each ayllu worships huacas, mummified ancestors kept in the Imperial capital, and several other deities of the Andine pantheon. The relocation of the Empire to the South didn't change much as Christianity never truly took because of the tales of Spanish brutalities against the colonized populations of the western provinces. Pachacuti II guaranteed freedom of religion in the hopes of securing the loyalty of the Quechua in Granada and to please the European powers. This created some backlash from some of the religious elite but Pachacuti left all religious decisions to the Willaq Umu, the High Priest of Inti who spent the following years consolidate the Imperial religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.A;Is this still the empire of Inti ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.T;The Inti state religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.D;While the Sapa Inka officially left all religious affairs to the priests of Inti, only performating the rituals required by the tradition following the decision of Pachacuti II, this only strenghtened the cult in the long term. The various Willaq Umu, chosen by the Sapa Inka and reserved by tradition to members of the Imperial family, formalized the relationship between the gods and the Sapa Inka who became even more in the Imperial ideology a divine being who was separate from the rest of his subjects. The various cults of the Andes were left untouched by these changes, as the official religion only took care of the Imperial cults and especially the shrines of Inti. The Inti faith was reenforced by this new movement as the people took part in Inti ceremonies to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire while honoring their huacas and offering sacrifices to their local divinities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC28.T;The Koricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.D;Back in the days of the old empire, the Willaq Umu performed their rituals in the golden temple, close to the Imperial palaces and in the true centre of the Empire. The Spanish demolished the temple, only leaving the foundations to build a church on it. While freedom of religion had been proclaimed and the Catholic cult was not persecuted anymore, the Imperial governement demolished the Church of Santo Francesco and planned a new Koricancha to be built. This act while heavily justified to the eyes of the Inti followers was met with rage by the Catholic faithful. The temple took nearly 15 years to be rebuilt, shining with gold and silver and being acclaimed as the herald of the new imperial architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC30.D;For decades the conquest of New-Mercia had been heralded as a great humanitarian project that had allowed civilization to flourish into the uncivilized Andes. But a recent report from a Burgundian missionary, Jean Casemer, who has spent 5 years in Native communities from the Andes has torn this facade apart. Collecting the tales of the great famine and the atrocities done by the Beornian army, he has personally scouted several abandoned villages 'meeting only death' for miles. His report was a blow to Beornian prestige although it did not amount to much as the Beornians never apologized or changed their stance about their Western provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now has come a formidable man, Lars Heyerdhal, a great explorer and commander who has heard of our plights and propose to wage war to recover our lost lands. A council of the main tribes of our country has declared him ‘toqi’, our leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC61.A;Long hail our savior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.T;Reports from the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.D;Troubled reports come from the Mapuche tribes. A man called Lars Heyerdhal coming from Scandinavia has seemingly been able to rally the tribes against our rule. Our contacts in the European embassies know nothing of this man who apparently was just a disillusioned immigrant in Camelot a few months ago. The Scandinavian attaché in Uraycusta pledges that he will get an official statement from his country, but he seems as lost as us on the situation. Our Foreign department is not so pleased by Scandinavian intervention. From their base of Tapt O, they have over the years sent several expeditions in the Southern Cone, and while there has been no official attempt to settle the place, the revolt of the Mapuche could very well be a pretext for Copenhagen to intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.A;What does this settler intends to do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.T;The Kingdom of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.D;Strange news come from Southern Ameriga. In two days we have received a demand from clarification from our representative in the Incan Empire and a letter of friendship from the so-called ‘King of Araucania and Patagonia’, Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal. Reports seem to indicate that Lars Heyerdhal was months ago just a worthless subject of the Crown, but he has apparently taken over the Mapuche tribes as their king and want to expel the Incas from their lands. While he seems like a madman, he could serve our interests. Numerous tribes inhabit the Southern Cone : let them unite under a King of our obedience while we settle the Magellan strait. Or we could let the Southerners deal with this delusional King. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.A;Recognize his kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.B;Assure the Incas we have nothing to do with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.T;Scandinavian recognition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.D;The letter from the King Karl-Lars has been received warmly by the Foreign department of Copenhagen who has recognized our state as sovereign and rightful. This has been a great honor for the King, who still apparently doesn’t know that a toqi is not the same thing as a King, but translation problems will have to wait for the end of the Inka claims on their territories. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC65.A;For the Mapuche!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.T;Scandinavian intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.D;What we thought was just a farce has now become a matter of state. The so-called kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia, instituted by the mad Lars Heyerdhal, has been recognized by the Scandinavians who now ask us to retire our troops from the Araucanian territory. Either we recognize the Mapuche claims to independence and risk to see a Scandinavian colony on our southern border in a few years or fight but that will surely means that we will have to face the Scandinavian armies and also navy, along with the resistant Mapuche.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.A;We will end the Mapuche threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC66.B;We must abandon this Southern endeavor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC67.T;The Araucanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC67.D;The Incans have decided to fight for their Southern territories. We must swiftly intervene : it will be hard to justify to the public a long war on the other side of the world if we don’t score a few victories and protect our allies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC67.A;To the far side of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC68.T;The Treaty of Uraycusta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC68.D;With no victory in sight, it is hard for us to get more credits for the war from home. We must accept that the Mapuche are subjects of the Incans and abandon any claims we could have on the Amerigan cone. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC68.A;Farewell my Amerigan dreams !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC69.T;Victory in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC69.D;With the Scandinavians letting us deal with the Mapuche at last, we can formally annex the Southern provinces into our state. Lars Heyerdhal has been sent back to Scandinavia and forbidden to set a foot into our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC72.T;Halting Beornian advances;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC72.D;We have been in a conflict with the Beornians for years over the archipelago of Tapt ø, which they claim we took from them. Besides this conflict, the Beornians have claimed over the years lands in Patagonia despite their old treaties with the Mapuche tribes. With the victory of the Kingdom of Araucania in the West, numerous tribes have proclaimed Karl-Lars their toqi as well in Patagonia. He now asks of us to help him free these tribes from Beornian influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC72.A;Send a squadron to Camelot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC73.T;A Scandinavian envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC73.D;We have received a message from the Scandinavian ambassador in Camelot that asks us to accept the claims of the Kingdom of Araucaunia over Patagonia by giving back any lands belonging to the Mapuche tribes we may have annexed in the previous years and settle our border at the Graham river. While crushing the Araucanians seems easy enough for our state, Scandinavia is another beast and it might be better if we accepted this treaty…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC73.A;What is valuable in the South anyway ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beornia has been forced to cede any landssouth of the Graham river and their settlers have been evacuated from Mapuche lands. Now the rule of the adventurer Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal extends over all the Mapuche lands, while Scandinavia has moved to occupy the Magellan strait to ‘safeguard it for international trade’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC77.T;The treaty of Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC77.D;The Scandinavians have vanquished us, shelling our ports and navies while imposing a dire blockade upon us. With their armies controlling some of our lands, we were forced to sign an humiliating treaty that cedes any lands we held across the River Graham to the so called Kingdom of Araucania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC82.T;Deposition of the Toqi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
INC82.T;Deposition of the Toqi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC82.D;The rule of Karl-Lars was always more important in his mind than in reality. Never learning the language of his subjects, he lived in his court proclaiming decisions that never were materialized. Eventually, his behaviour clashed with the Mapuche elders that organized a great gathering in the capital and deposed him as toqi, and sent him back to his homeland. Now they have decided to end the Kingdom of Araucania to proclaim a Republic of the Mapuche people. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC82.A;Farewell Karl-Lars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC83.T;The establishment of the Araucanian protectorate ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC83.D;Eventually Karl-Lars ideas clashed with his subjects habits. Our ‘good ally’ was ferried back to Copenhagen where he has spent the last days in an apathic state. We could easily convince him to give his royal rights to the King, settle him in a Norwegian fjord and move to annex the Mapuche into our colonial empire. After all, we control their military with their officers trained by our men and supplying them with weapons and ammunition. Or we could recognize the new Republic they have created so that it could serve us as a buffer in Ameriga : after all, the land down there is not that important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC83.A;Annex the tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC83.B;We prefer a buffer Mapuche council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC84.T;Establishment of the Araucanian protectorate ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC84.D;After the deposition of the adventurer King Karl-Lars by the Mapuche tribes that had elected him, the former sovereign settled in his natal Norway, abdicating his rights to Scandinavia who swiftly decided to impose a protectorate on the Mapuche. Resistance was easily crushed : Scandinavians had explored the territory for years, and knew whose elders could help them in controlling the territory. This brought an end to the shortlived attempt at Mapuche independence as Scandinavia extended its Ildmark colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

##### Aragon and the Latin Empire (Coded by DeNuke, Localized by Various) ##############;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA02.T;The “Third Rome” Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA02.D;”Your Majesty, that all the Christian kingdoms came to an end, coalesced into your realm, two Romes have fallen, the third stands, and there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Kingdom as according to Revelation 17:10”\n\nAn speech has just been delivered in the Iberian Cortes by a noble claiming to have apparitions of John the Apostle - stating that Aragon is the sole and legal heir to Rome, owing to its likeness to the Roman Empire of old. He proceeded that as Rome’s heirs, Aragon must expand and unite all Latins under one realm. To say this speech is divisive would be an understatement. While the idea of this newfangled “Panlatin” movement piqued many commoners, intellectuals and the Royal Court, the rich and the powerful nobility scoff at the idea, especially the part where they would submit under one crown. This is becoming an issue we cannot ignore any longer. How shall our King respond to this idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA02.A;”Panlatinism shall be a role model we shall aspire to...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA02.B;”I like the idea but we can’t commit to this…yet.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA02.C;”This is a preposterous idea that shall only tear us apart!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA03.T; Italian nationalist activities intensify;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ARA03.D;With their recent acquisition of both Genoa and Corsica, Savoy has announced the creation of their new Grand-Duchy of Piedmont. While we wouldn’t usually care about the affairs of Turino the effect on our Italian lands has been noticeable. Italian nationalist activities have recently increased as they see Piedmont as a potential unifier for the Italian people in contrast to the revolutionaries in Etruria. Work is being done to stamp down on these groups but it seems that our problems are only increasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA03.A;If they move against us we will crush these upstarts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA4.T;Conservatives succeed in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA4.D;Etruria, the home of the revolution in Italy, has now finally snuffed the revolurary flame. A new consertaive government has taken hold in Florence and the revolutionaries that once called Etruria home have either been purged or renounced their old ideals. In fact the government does not even seem to hold the idea of a republic dear as there have been talks in having Duchess Margherita of Lucca return as the Duchess of Tuscany. However, this idea faces resistance in Florence and it is uncertain whether Margherita will be able to reclaim her duchy yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA4.A;Good to hear that the Etruscans can see sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA5.T;Liberals succeed in Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA5.D; We had hoped that the flame of revolution in Etruria had burnt out, if not, only glowed dimly. However, after recent events in their country it appears that the fire of revolution burns brightly in Etruria. This news has reached many Italian republicans and nationalists and already groups are starting to organize even in our own Italian lands. It’s very clear that Etruria will not stop toward their goals of Italian unification and we must be prepared to stop them should they move against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA5.A;The Revolutionary Hydra roars again, we need to prepare for war and revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA6.T; Etruria falls to dictatorship;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA6.D;After the failure of their agents in spreading their revolution the libeal government of Etruria has fallen. In its place is a dictatorship, supported by the moderates in their military. Already the revolutionary organizations that Etruria once patronized are being purged and it seems that nationlist activities in our Italian lands are also starting to calm down. It looks like we will no longer have to fear Etruria destabilizing Italy anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA6.A;The Revolutionary Hydra lies defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA7.T;Nobles demand action against the Santamarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA7.D;Back during the start of the XIXth century in response to Revolutionary Etruria’s invasion of Naples, the Santamarians, peasant bandits, rose to fight against the revolution as well as liberal and anticlerical forces both real and perceived. While they aren’t as powerful as they once were, the Santamarians still cause trouble from time to time. In the time since they also started seeing themselves as the protectors of the Catholic Church. To this end when some liberals were protesting the powers and privileges of the church, a band of Santamarians suddenly appeared and a riot broke out. Debate is being held if we should move against the Santamarians, as while we don’t like the liberals at least they currently aren’t destroying things. However, It is believed that the Santamarians are in contact with the Pope who may be giving them tact support. Not only that but local nobles seem indifferent if not supportive of the Santamarians. If we move against the Santamarians chances are it will put us against the Pope, and hurt our standing with the nobility. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA7.A;Demand the arrest of the Santamarians involved;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA7.B;Look the other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA8.T;The Santamarians petition us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA8.D;We have received a surprising petition from an agent claiming to be working with the Santamarians. He said that the Santamarians are appreciative of us not moving against them and have come with a proposal. They want official support to move against anyone who threatens or goes against the Catholic Church, liberal or noble alike, as well as granting the church some privileges that would infringe on that of the nobility. Naturally, this proposal is sure to anger the nobility and there is no telling what the ramifications could be in giving the church more power than they already have. The Santamarian agent is waiting for a response, should we accept the proposal?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA8.A;Yes we find this arrangement acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA8.B;No this is too far, reject their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA9.T;Santamarians escape into Benevento;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA9.D;It appears we underestimated the support the Santamarians have. When we sent police to arrest the Santamarians involved in that riot it appears that they were tipped off by someone. After some investigating it appears that they were assisted by some Borgist legitimists and have sought asylum in the Papal enclave of Benevento. Our demands to extradite the accused men have been rebuffed by the Papal Legate who seem intent on protecting the Santamarians. We have come so far. Should we drop the case and let the Santamarians go free or should we cross over onto Papal land and take them in by force? Doring this will surely anger the nobility as well as the Pope who is sure to respond harshly to our trespassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA9.A;Respect the Papal asylum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA9.B;Move in, brigands should not be welcomed by the Papal authorities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA90.T;The Excommunication of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA90.D;We knew that going after the Santamarians in Benevento would anger the Pope but in a shocking declaration the Pope has excommunicated King Josep. The Pope has stated that his reason for the excommunication is not only Josep’s trespass on Benevento but also his attack on the faithful sons of the Santamarians. This news has predictably spread unrest not only to the nobility but also the common folk throughout the Crowns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA90.A;Father, forgive us for our tresspasses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA10.T;The Nobility wishes us to dismiss Panlatinist ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA10.D;Our actions handling the Santamarians have helped to endear us to the nobility. However, the nobility has decided to petition us on refuting any support of the Panlatin movement.The nobles in Naples are the most powerful force in the realm, using the local Parliament to enshrine their privileges into laws. The Panlatinist theorists and their supporters throughout the Crowns support a complete reform that would centralize and overhaul the political structure into a modern state rather than the archaic confederal Kingdom we rule. The nobles have thus made it clear that they will not tolerate any change to the old contract between the Monarchy and each Crown, and demand an official repudiation of Panlatinism.Even if we dismiss our support of Panlatinism this doesn’t mean the end of our attempt to centralize the kingdom, just the end of this approach. How should we respond to the nobles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA10.A;Their time has passed ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA10.B;For the sake of stability they are right ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA11.T;The Representative from Zaragoza ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA11.D;Another day another representative from the nobility, this time from the Cortes of Aragon in Zaragoza. They have a fairly typical petition, the nobility wants reassurances that their old privileges will stay. While we would usually use honey words to try and soothe them over this time is different. This petition is also signed by the King of Navarre, who has been frequenting the Cortes in Zaragoza, which means we will actually have to make a decision. The King of Navarre has become concerned especially after the talk of Panlatinism and the rising tensions over Italian unification. If we wish to commit to the centralization of the Crowns we will have to dismantle their old privileges. While the King of Navarre is technically a vassal of Aragon they run their own affairs and may not wish to remain a part of our realm if we threaten his power. This isn’t even accounting for the potential reaction amongst the various political factions such as the liberals. It is time to make a decision that will affect the future of our kingdom are we going to keep the old privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA11.A;Aragon cannot survive like it is currently, the old privileges will be phased out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA11.B;Our Kingdom is too fragile. A decentralized realm is best for everyone. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA12.T;Liberals support Centralization ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA12.D;Unsurprisingly, our plan to centralize our kingdom is hated by the nobility, However, to our surprise liberals in Valencia have announced their support towards our centralization plans. Apparently they are hopeful that this centralization will standardize the legal system throughout the kingdom as well as ensure that the same political freedoms apply to our subjects regardless of where they live. This support has soothed our usual stressed tensions with the liberals, for now at least. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA12.B;A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA13.T;Liberals demand we support centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA13.D;To our surprise liberals in Valencia have come forward to announce their dislike of our current decentralization policies. Apparently, they want a centralized kingdom as it will unify both our legal and political system throughout our realm. This presents us with an opportunity. With the support of the liberals we should have enough political capital to maneuver around the nobles, however this will of course anger the nobles as we will be going back on our word. Should we agree with the liberals demands or should we stay the course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA13.A;I can’t believe we agree with the liberals on something ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA13.B;Like we said our kingdom is too fragile we need this stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA14.T;Revolutionaries in Sassari? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA14.D;We have recently received reports of possible revolutionary activity in the town of Sassari on the island of Sardinia. We've had trouble with Sardina before, as a popular revolt years ago spiraled out of control and resulted in the creation of the so-called Republic of Arborea. By the time the Aragonese army arrived to defeat the Republic all except for the towns of Sassari, Alghero, and Cagliari were under Arborean control. It also didn’t help that the Arboreans forced out whatever Catalan settlers they could find in the interior of the country, forcing them into the major towns. We cannot let history repeat itself. We have already drawn up plans for a massive crackdown on suspected revolutionaries and it should nip and rebellion in the bud. However, such a brutal display will most likely offend our other Italian holdings in Sicily and Naples and threaten the stability of the kingdom as a whole. Instead we could just ignore the revolutionaries as they are currently suspected to be few in number, and just station some troops on the island in case anything should break out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA14.A;Take no chances, begin the crackdown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA14.B;A few revolutionaries cannot take an island ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA15.T;The Second Republic of Arborea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA15.D;A revolt has broken out in the town of Sassari. Led by Luciano Buonaparte, cousin of Gastone Buonaparte of Corsica, they have proclaimed the Second Republic of Arborea in the northern half of the island of Sardinia. We must move fast and destroy this rebellion before they can fully seize control of the island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA15.A;ugh, not again, well at least it’s just one town this time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA16.T;The Treaty of Cagliari;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA16.D;We have failed to defeat the Republic of Arborea and not only that but we have lost all of Sardinia to their revolt. Figures are being pointed everywhere as to how we could have lost but regardless of why it happened it bodes poorly for the future of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA16.A;This is a black eye for our reputation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA17.T;A futile revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA17.D;The second Republic of Arborea has been defeated and its leaders captured. While we have won this time it is clear we need to do something to prevent a possible third Arborea from happening. To accomplish this we have expanded the rights and protections of the Sardinian people in order to placate them, while at the same time removing any troublemakers who might act against us. These two measures should firmly put the island under our control and ensure no further revolutionary revolts happen here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA17.A;This time we will learn from our mistakes ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA18.T;The Consequences of a united Italy ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA18.D;The formation of a united Italian government poses a significant threat to the stability of our realm. Already liberal and separatist sentiments have been growing in our Italian possession and most likely continue to grow so long as this Italian government remains ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA18.A;It’s just one headache after another ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA19.T;The Italian Confederation ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA19.D;One of the worst fears the government of Aragon had was the formation of a united Italian government. While the creation of the Italian Confederation should spark panic it has actually produced the opposite. This government is only united in name and is otherwise fractured and weak. This dysfunctional government has only helped to reduce support of a united Italy in our lands. While the Confederation could become a threat later on, it is currently a useful tool in keeping our Italian holdings in their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA19.A;We have nothing to fear from this weak government. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA20.T;People doubt our legitimacy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA20.D;With our fall from great power status, and other nations superseding us, our people are starting to doubt whether or not Aragon can survive to the end of the century. Already Italian nationalists have returned with a newfound energy and are causing trouble in our Italian lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA20.A;Everybody’s a critic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA21.T;Order restored in the Southern Italians crowns ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA21.D;The Southern Italian revolt that threatened to throw us out of Italy has been defeated. The revolutionaries and their allies have either fled or have been arrested. Our victory has reassured many in our country and brought more support to the government of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA21.A;We are here to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA22.T;The Borgist revolt defeated ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA22.D;The revolt by Borgist legtimatists to try and hand our Italian lands to the former queen, Maria, has been defeated. Once again the rightful rule of King Josep has been reasserted and not only that but the threat of Italian nationalists seems to have been weakened as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA22.A;How many times do we have to tell you that Josep is the King? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA23.T;The opening of the Valencian Conference ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA23.D;”My subjects, our long national nightmare is over. We must now begin a sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent stability and happiness for all of Aragon” King Josep I \n\n An extraordinary session of the Valencian Cortes was called today by the King. The King, in his speech, announced that over the next seven days the future of the Aragon political system will be decided here. There are many factions at play here from all over the crowns, the Panlatinists, the liberals, the conservatives, and even some closet separatists will be partaking in the debate. Our recent actions, as well as the various outside political factors, have all been leading to this moment and now it is out of our hands. Soon we will know if Aragon will endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA23.A;The suspense is killing me ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA24.T;Status quo, Aragon will endure ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA24.D;After a week of debate it has been decided that Aragon will continue under its current system with a few minor reforms. The main reason for this conclusion comes from how well we have handled each crisis that has come our way proving that this system is strong enough to survive internal strife. While this outcome has disappointed many who hoped for the creation of a new political-scape, Aragon for now will continue to survive as it has been for the last couple of generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA24.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA25.T;Panlantinism wins out at the conference ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA25.D;After a week of heated debate it has been decided that Aragon will embrace the ideas of the Panlatinist movement. The reason for this decision comes from how while the Aragon Crown has withstood the crises thrown at it, it has become apparent that it will most likely not survive more crises under its current system. The prevalence of the Panlatinist movement quickly found support in the conference as the best alternative to the current political landscape. While this is a triumph for the Panlatinists, the unenviable task of applying it must be carried out by us. Aragon may have avoid collapse for now, but can we guarantee Panlatinism will save it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA25.A;Audentes fortuna iuvat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA26.T;The conference collapses ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA26.D;The Valencian Conference has failed to come to a conclusion on how to save Aragon. The members of the conference clearly see that Aragon has not done well handling the crises thrown at it, but they are split on what should be done to remedy this instability. The nobles still want to continue the old system with some minor reforms, the Panlatinists want a more centralized government, and the liberals want more freedoms to go along with it. Unfortunately, what's done is done and the future of Aragon looks bleak. Already reports are coming in from all over the Crowns about secessionist movements which at this point seem all but a certainty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA26.A;Comença el malson ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA27.T;The Kingdom of Naples secedes ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA27.D;To our shock the Parliament of Naples has decided to secede from the Crown of Aragon and elect another king in place of Josep.The new king is none other than Josep’s brother, Alfons who, while not being a legitimate bastard of Joan IV, has endeared himself to the Neapolitan nobles. While we would like to restore our rule through military force, it would just just throw the Crown into complete chaos. All we can do is let Naples go and do our best to try and keep our realm together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA27.A;How can we recover from this ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA28.T;La Divisione ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA28.D;The secession of Naples was only the beginning of our problems. People in our Italian holdings have named the loss of Naples as “La Divisione”, the division. Many in our territories now seem interested in carrying out their own division in their lands. Our government is paralyzed trying to fight these sentiments and an emergency draft has been called to try and restore order. Naturally such chaos is encouraging many people to flee the country and is only serving to weaken us further. There is no telling how this will end, but it is clear that it is only going to get worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA28.A;Dark days are upon us. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA29.T;Sicily and Sardinia leave Aragon ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA29.D;Inspired by the Cortes of Naples, the Cortes of both Sicily and Sardinia announced that they would be seceding from the Aragonese Crown and electing their own kings just as Naples did. The on-going crisis, which is now formally called La Divisió—the Catalan form of La Divisione-–prevents us from committing resources to bring them back into the fold. If we survive this we can work on trying to bring them back, but for now let us just focus on our African and Iberian holdings. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA29.A;Et tu, el meu amic? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA30.T;Africa revolts! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA30.D;Sensing blood in the water the Berber tribes of Africa have once again risen up in revolt against our rule. While we are barely staying afloat, we must respond to this revolt and, just like all the other Berber revolts, we must put it down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA30.A;How many times do we have to keep teaching you this lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA31.T;Catalonian nationalists organize ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA31.D;Out of all our holdings our lands in Iberia have always been the most loyal and stable. However, La Divisió has changed all of that and now Catalonian nationalists have gathered in Barcelona to organize their own revolt against the Crown. They see the idea of Aragon and the monarchy as a whole as a failure and instead want to establish a wholly Catalonian nation Republic after a brief dictatorship. Time is slowly ticking down and it appears that complete civil war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA31.A;When it rains it pours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA32.T;La Divisió últim ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA32.D;It seems La Divisió has finally reached a crescendo. The Catalonian nationalists have risen up in the east and they seek to overthrow us. They seek to end Aragon and replace it with their Catalonian nation. The only way Aragon can survive is by completely defeating Catalonia, a white peace would only secure their independence. To make matters worse Navarra has revoked their oath of loyalty to the Crown and are now completely independent. And to top it all off the Cortes of Zaragoza in the province of Aragon, our namesake, are offering the title of King of Aragon to the King of Navarra. With what limited diplomatic capability we have left we have been able to convince Navarra’s potential friends to try and dissuade Navarra from taking that title. However, should Navarra take the province of Aragon we will have to fight them as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA32.A;When will it ever end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA33.T;Zaragoza proclaims us their king. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA33.D;After we declared our independence from Aragon we thought that we would only longer have to deal with them. However, the Cortes of Zaragoza have proclaimed the Bourbons of Navarra as king of Aragon, that is the province of Aragon not of the Crown of Aragon. This represents a great opportunity for us as adding the province of Aragon will more than double the size of our kingdom. However, the other great powers of Europe have come together to inform us that while they won’t stop us from taking the title they will also not support us. The Aragonese Crown has made it clear that taking the province of Aragon will start a war between us, and the Aragonese Crown promises that they will not stop until all of Navarra is under Aragonese control. How should we respond to the Cortes of Zaragoza’s offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA33.A;We will take the title. Aragon cannot fight both us and Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA33.B;We only wanted independence. We will refuse the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA34.T;The Crown triumphant ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA34.D;The Civil War is over, the Catalonian nationalists have been defeated, and our rule in Iberia is secure. Order has finally been restored and it looks like La Divisió is finally past us. Now we must work on rebuilding our kingdom, while we may not reach the heights we once aspired to, we must show that we are not powerless either. We will soon turn our eyes to the Kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily and begin plotting for our inevitable return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA34.A;Aragon is not yet lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA35.T;Aragon Defeated ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA35.D;Our revolution against the Aragonese Crown is over and we are victorious. With our victory our president has formally announced that he is stepping down and free elections will begin immediately. A new dawn begins for Catalonia, whether that will be as an independent nation or possibly as a member of a greater Iberian state, only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA35.A;La persevança tot ho alcança;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA36.T;The Catalonian Compromise ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA36.D;We have been unable to defeat the Catalonian nationalists, but likewise the nationalists could not defeat us. For the sake of the people a compromise has been reached. The King of Aragon will accept the title of King of Catalonia but will henceforth renounce the title of King of Aragon. The King of Catalonia will only serve in a ceremonial role as true power will be invested in the people of the country who will vote for their representatives who will form the ruling government. The dream of Aragon on the world’s stage is truly dead now but hopefully this arrangement will allow Catalonia to prosper in Aragon’s place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA36.A;It was either this or losing everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA37.T;The Aragonese Antilles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA37.D;Like most of European monarchies, Aragon tried to get colonies into the profitable Caribbean when the region was engulfed in chaos and lands were in perpetual change of ownerships. The Aragonese King Ferran V, acquired Sant Jordi and Monsterrat in the early XVIIIth century but the promised paradise never came. Nowadays these islands are pretty much relics of past adventures and the wealth extracted from the plantations barely suffice to cover their needs. For years the Crown has wondered what to do with both, and some have proposed we sell them to a power of our choice. Spain and the Dual-Monarchy both hold islands in the Antilles but our rivalry with them would make it hard to sell this proposal to the Cortes. On the other hand Scandinavia and Burgundy would likely appreciate these islands and be ready to pay for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA37.A;They are valuable enough to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA37.B;Burgundy it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA37.C;Scandinavia would be a better choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA38.T;An Aragonese proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA38.D;Aragon holds two islands in the Antilles, Sant Jordi and Montserrat. Their ambassador has approached us to sell them, arguing Aragon has no need of these territories anymore. While largely unimportant compared to other islands, having these islands would boost our influence in the New World and would deny more ports to the Spanish and Anglo-French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA38.A;We can pay for these islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA38.B;Our funds are too tight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA39.T;$FROM_COUNTRY$ has accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA39.D;We have successfully sold Sant Jordi and Montserrat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA39.A;Farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA40.T;$FROM_COUNTRY$ has refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA40.D;We have to keep Sant Jordi and Montserrat apparently?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA40.A;They are integral parts of the crown I guess?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA41.T;Reports from our spies in Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA41.D;The most bewildering news has arrived from Tuscany. The heathen revolutionaries, not content to spoil the Tuscan lands, have attracted convicts, exiles and brigands from the whole Italian peninsula to form ?the first Italian National Assembly?. While not more than an assembly of criminals and demagogues, both the Crowns of Naples and Sicily are represented in this meeting by students leaders and populist exiles who claim that the Revolution of 1829 was only the beginning and that with the help of Firenze they?ll be able to defeat the clerical hordes of the Santamarians and bring progress to the lands of the South. While their powerbase must not be overrated, we must warn that Etruria does not smuggle dangerous elements that may ?Rtry to rise in Naples and perhaps even Sicily if we go to war with Etruria?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA41.A;We will keep watch over the Two Sicilies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN1.T;The Prisoner’s Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN1.D;The Panlatinist ideal, despite the anger of puny Aragonese nobility, the threat of Italian nationalism, and the ramblings of the Church, has triumphed against all odds. Popular support for the monarchy has reached all-new heights and a new wave of optimism seems to have taken over the populace. Despite the entirety of King-turned Emperor Josep’s Latin subjects embracing such an idea, a lingering “threat” is still an eyesore to our ambitions: the “Prisoner” of the Vatican. His Holiness has been deprived of any role in the upcoming Panlatin project, owing to our often dismissive policies of the Papacy and the Church, by extension, that has lessened their in state affairs. While this state of affairs might be a boon for liberals and intellectuals in our realm, the faithful have recently asked our monarch to reconsider our approach with the Holy See.The “prisoner”, the Pope himself, along with his numerous & foolhardy followers will not take matters to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN1.A;We can expect a word from the Prisoner very soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN2.T;The Roma Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN2.D;The nobility and subjects of the newly proclaimed Latin Emperor all over Italy and the various crowns of Aragon are gathered at Rome for a conference on the new nature of the Empire. All of them are gathered, not to commemorate this historic moment, but for an answer to the ever threatening “Latinist Question”. Will it be of the Roman Emperors of old, an entirely new “Roman” ideal, past glories worthy of being resuscitated once more? Or will it be of Carolus Magnus, an emperor crowned by the Pope and built a vast empire whose legacies are still being sung to this day? While such matters being nonetheless of no importance , it will define the conduit of the state especially as relations with The Holy See are less than cordial, and the condemnation of the Panlatinists result in a lack of actual ideology for the Empire. Josep Serna takes on the podium, delivering his inaugural speech to the Imperial Grand Cortes, uttering in a raspy, stern voice:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN2.A;”My dear subjects, the might of the Latin ideal shall be stressed.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN2.B;”My dear subjects, we shall make our efforts to reconcile with his Holiness.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN3.T;An Audience from His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN3.D;Your highness, it seems that our present approach with His Holiness has been quite “ambivalent”, as usual. The “once-crazy” ideas of Panlatinism are well and alive in the empire despite all odds. Despite festivities being held welcoming the Empire’s foundation and the Great Powers of the world being wary of our next moves that shall surely threaten their own ambitions, the papal nuncio in Roma along with his entourage arrived recently with news to discuss “their role” in this incoming plan of ours. The question remains: shall we comply with His Holiness’ wishes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN3.A;We shall proceed without the Vatican’s consent;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN3.B;It wouldn’t be wise that we ignore His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN4.T;An Audience from His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN4.D;Your highness, it seems that our present approach with His Holiness has been quite “ambivalent”, as usual. The Empire has remained steadfast to its traditional, Aragonese roots owing to its open rejection of the absurd Pan-Latin idea. Despite festivities being held welcoming the Empire’s foundation and  the Great Powers of the world  being wary of our next moves that shall surely threaten their own ambitions, the papal nuncio in Roma along with his entourage arrived recently with news to discuss “their role” in this incoming plan of ours.

LATIN4.B;It wouldn’t be wise that we ignore His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN5.T;A Demand from the Santamarian Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN5.D;The Empire’s foundation was of a very unique nature. Even with our affirmation of Pan-Latinist values which withstood all trials and obstacles alike, we have been at times seemingly subordinate to the Papacy’s whims and have given immense economic and political concessions to the Santamarians. Today, in an audience with the King-turned-Emperor, the Santamarian Society expressed their open “disgust” of the Pan-Latinist ideal, citing its utter contrarian nature to the Catholic faith and its destructive reformist elements. Agreeing with their “request” may carry potential massive repercussions, but must we even backtrack and cave in to these preposterous demands after all the sacrifices we have made for the Panlatinist cause?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN5.A;I agree. Such ideals aren’t welcome in this land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN5.B;...And throw away everything we have toiled for?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN6.T;A Demand from His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN6.D;The Empire’s foundation was of a very unique nature. We have been at times seemingly subordinate to the Papacy’s whims and have given immense economic and political concessions to the Santamarians. Retaining our traditional confederalist policies of old and championing the long-dated ideals of divine right, the Papacy has dictated that we comply with “His wishes lest we go astray with God’s will on most high.” Given our current situation with the Church, it seems that the Imperial Court has no chance to resist such a,  let’s say, irresistible request from the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN6.A;We have no choice. We shall be given their most humble “blessing”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN7.T;Imperator Latinorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN7.D;The year is $YEAR$. The Aragonese Crown’s subjects and nobles are gathered at Rome, the capital of the new Latin Empire. Years of tumultuous struggle and politicking all over the thrones of Italy has led to Rome firmly within their grasp - confirming their rule all over the peninsula. What Ferrando or any European monarch have envied and failed to achieve, Josep Serna has been given the prestigious title of the Emperor of the Latins, becoming the sole leader of all Latindom.\n\nThe Great Powers were aghast by this news, as their plans will be set alight due to any potential meddling from this upstart. Despite this, the Empire’s subjects are ecstatic, welcoming the news with open arms as a new era unfolds once more that hopefully, would last long and prosper for a thousand years. A new, perhaps reborn Latin Empire is once again poised to declare its hegemony in the Mediterranean, and perhaps even taking the mantle of Europe’s most foremost power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN7.A;Evviva!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN8.T;Imperator Romaniae;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN8.D;The year is $YEAR$. With birthright dating back to the 13th-century Constantinopolitan Empire of old, the monarchs of Aragon often envied the title of Latin Emperor. At the festivities’ apex, the emperor-to-be abruptly snatched the Imperial Crown from the Pope’s hands, firmly placing it on his head for the entire audience to see. This act effectively made him Imperator Romaniae, “Emperor of the lands of the Romans”. Such a gesture both stunned many and has gathered an assortment of reactions from commoners and upperclassmen alike.\n\nThe Great Powers were aghast by this news, as their plans will be set alight due to any potential meddling from this upstart. The Papacy has released a statement that shunned this “childish and reckless” act, but refused to comment any further. A new, perhaps, reborn “Roman” Empire is poised to declare its hegemony in the Mediterranean, and perhaps even all of European civilization - inheriting the legacy of Romulus as we know it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN8.A;Carpe diem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN9.T;Imperator Romaniae;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN9.D;The year is $YEAR$. The newfound Empire has taken a more Catholic character, emphasizing the Catholic faith and religion in the inner workings of the state to the disdain of reformists and even nobility and commoners alike. After a dignified celebration held at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, Josep Serna was crowned Catholic Emperor by His Holiness the Pope, with rumors of an “internal” agreement backed by the Holy See and the Santamarian Society behind this occasion. Despite the gossip and questionable nature of his coronation, the Emperor’s Catholic subjects have welcomed the news, although sparking debate amongst other Catholics in Europe and the world.\n\nThe Great Powers were aghast by this news, as their plans will be set alight due to any potential meddling from this upstart. A new, perhaps reborn Catholic Empire is once again poised to declare its hegemony in the Mediterranean,  and perhaps even taking the mantle of Europe’s most foremost power? And elevating the jurisdiction of God's authority on Earth in the process? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN9.A;Evviva?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN10.T;Nationalist protests in Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN10.D;The streets of Milan, historically a hotspot of Italian nationalism, has been experiencing its own severe bouts of unrest and disorder on the streets. Following the news of Emperor Josep’s coronation, crowds of cityfolk have gathered in the tightly packed piazza-  begun destroying handmade effigies and have clamored for the Emperor’s “unfortunate passing” as such an emperor is neither “Italian nor Roman'' at all. Protestors have often clashed with city police with some accounts of violent encounters with the local army garrison in the city’s outskirts, presumably with Gonzagan loyalist agitators. It is no denying that these actions will escalate into outright secession of the Lombard Crowns or a full-blown rebellion in the near future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN10.A;We send our thoughts and prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN11.T;The Matter of the Lombard Holdings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN11.D;”...The Duchies of Savoy, Milan, Genoa, so on and so on, along with the countless principalities, counties and holdings scattered across Northern Italy and its surrounding territories therein have been a severe bottleneck in solidifying our control in that region. Given the recent tragedy at Milan perpetrated by a resurrected Italian nationalist cell as we know it, it seems that we have no choice but to choice but to *expletive* to bring the rebellious North to the fold! - in the name of our Emperor. Our esteemed statesmen have put forth *coughs* several proposals to deal with this affair at once :...”\n\nStoltano Cuolano MP, his speech to the Grand Latin Cortes with Regards to the Matter of Northern Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN12.T;The Burgundian Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN12.D;The lost lands of Savoy and Bresse have been coveted by the Dukes and Kings of Burgundy since their loss during the fracturing of the Burgundian progenitor state in the 11th-12th century, and the Burgundian Crown’s failure to wrest control over these lands in the decades to follow. However with a potentially isolated and recupering Latin Empire, it is most wise that we must intervene at once before they grow ever stronger by the coming day;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN12.A;Send them an ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN12.B;A preposterous idea. Are these mountain dwellers of any strategic importance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN13.T;The Burgundian Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN13.D;Our envoy in Anvers has received dire news: The Burgundian King has passed a joint decree that effectively declares the lands of Savoy and Bresse an integral part of their realm. Concurrent with the reports, Imperial Alpini scouts along the Savoyard borders between Burgundy have spotted numerous Burgundian Army on the cold foothills of the Alps conducting maneuvers: an imminent sign of a potential invasion from the North. What shall be our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN13.A;Savoy and Bresse are an integral part of our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN13.B;We wish no open conflict with the Burgundians. We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN14.T;The Latins Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN14.D;It seems like the stubborn runts have refused to renounce their territorial control over the Savoy-Bresse area, despite our sabre-rattling with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$. It seems that open conflict with these upstarts is the only solution, somehow…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN14.A;Nous reviendrons, Latins;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN15.T;The Latins Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN15.D;Great news indeed. The Latin diplomatic envoys have accepted their demands and have announced their intention to withdraw all their government and military personnel from the Savoy-Bresse area within the coming week with the observance of the International Concert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN15.A;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN16.T;The Milano Treaty of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN16.D;With accordance to the said treaty, we have been created as an autonomous dependency by the Latin Empire, following the agreement with the Latin Cortes to reinstate autonomy to the Empire’s Northern Italian lands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN16.A;We shall swear fealty to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN17.T;The Revocation of Savoy and Bresse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN17.D;As per agreement with the Burgundians and the Latin Empire, the Areas of Savoy and Bresse are effectively given back to Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN17.A;A loss, but it couldn’t be helped..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN18.T;The Matter of Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN18.D;Tuscany, infamously known as the rebel state of Etruria, has been the leading force of Italian unification and a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment ever since the Revolutions of 1808. The Etrurians, despite setbacks in 1814, Etruria still remained steadfast to its liberal and revolutionary roots, even with our subjugation. The Tuscans, nevertheless, are still nostalgic for the return of the Republic’s old glories. Margherita, The Grand Duchess of Toscana has approached us, and wants our support for her continued Restauration while we could co-opt former Republicans in our new empire, that would surely placate the rebellious crown, for now at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN20.T;The Mezzogiorno Debacle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN20.D; Bands of Santamarians have grown larger, with the tacit support of the local priests and the Cortes of Naples and Palermo are dominated by the nobility that does not  want to compromise with their privileges. Our state must decide who is our foremost enemy in Sicily : the nobility or the brigands. One of our politicians propose giving complete land reforms as an effort to stem the tide, or outright hope that the Santamarian unrest would die down by declaring Martial law in Napoli and Sicilia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN21.T;Dissent among the Nobility;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN21.D;Despite the efforts made to instill land reform to the impoverished lands of Southern Italy, countless Sicilian and Neapolitan nobles are enraged at the sight of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administrators and bureaucrats trying to enter their vast holdings and estates. Our policies seems to be gaining the ire of the landholders at most and some have stepped up to suggest a “less harsh” approach to land reform be made, preferably one that still guarantees a variety of rights and bureaucratic loopholes to the landholders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN21.A;§RContinue with the land reform - as planned.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN21.B;§GI hope these concessions won’t bring trouble any further§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN22.T;The Southern Backlash;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN22.D;The landed nobility and landholders have become excessively ostracized by the crown due to the continuous practices of land reform in the south. While there were a few unfortunate instances of violent reprisals against administrators and bureaucrats “trespassing” in private property, with reports of landholders taking up arms and brimming with anti-Imperial sentiment. However with the Imperial Army being sent in to escort government personnel and subdue any troublemakers the situation in the Mezzogiorno in the eyes of the average commoner seems to be improving for the better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN22.A;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN23.T;Il Grande Esodo;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LATIN23.D;The Mezzogiorno still looks to the unaware eye as a place where modernity has not yet arrived, where the landed nobility still benefits from the works of their tenants who live poor and simple lives. But for many, this is not acceptable anymore. After seeing our failure to legislate on the land reform, many young men and women have departed to the New World and many will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN24.T;Navarre and the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN24.D;Navarre has had a long and complicated history with the Crown of Aragon. The Aragonese kings have long sought to integrate Navarre but constant wars from various claimants to the Navarrese throne frustrated their attempts. A solution to this long conflict was reached in 1545 where Charles de Bourbon negotiated the Capitulations of Tudela. The Bourbons were to be made the Monarchs of Navarre but they were to be subject to the Cortes of Zaragoza and functionally be an extension of the Realm of Aragon. However, as we work towards centralizing the empire the King of Navarre, Henri IV, appears to be using his position in the Cortes to work against us. The nobles seemed to be swayed by his claim that our focus on Italy is hurting the western part of the empire. If the nobles are convinced we could soon see Henri IV leading an enlarged Navarro-Aragonese state against us. It might be wise to detach Navarre from the Cortes of Zaragoza and give them their own Cortes in Pamplona. This would hurt our centralization efforts but it would also stop any of Henri’s plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN25.D;Navarre has had a long and complicated history with the Crown of Aragon.

LATIN26.T;Henri IV, Champion of the Aragonese ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN26.D;Our King, Henri IV, has taken advantage of our overlord’s recent problems and has begun stirring up an independence movement around himself. He has used his connections to the Cortes of Zaragoza to convince the nobles that the empire doesn't care about the prosperity of their western lands and that it may best to secede from the empire. This message has even found good support among the common people within the Realm of Aragon who already felt out of place in the empire due to their Navarro-Aragonese heritage. Henri IV is already being seen as a hero in the eastern part of the empire and is being called the Champion of the Aragonese. Henri IV has begun touring the Realm of Aragon trying to build up support from his powerbase in the newfound Navarro-Aragonese movement. We can only hope for the King’s safety as he brings his plans to fruition and frustrates the whole of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN26.A;Is this the start of something grand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN27.T; Henri IV, Champion of the Aragonese ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN27.D;It seems our fears were warranted as Henri IV, the King of Navarre, has stirred up a whole movement around the Navarro-Aragonese against us. It appears that the dissatisfaction was not only limited to the nobles but the people as well who already felt out of place in our empire, and our work in Italy has only exacerbated this problem. Despite Henri’s support being only limited to the Basques and the Navarro-Aragonese, people have started calling him the Champion of the Aragonese, the eastern part of our empire. Henry IV is already going on tour throughout the Realm of Aragon building support for himself. There is nothing we can do to stop Henri IV as arresting him will only cause a revolt to break out that will threaten the stability of our empire. Not only that, but Henri IV has no heir currently, and if the worst were to happen a succession crisis would break out in Navarre which our neighbors in the north could use to try and remove Navarre from our holdings. All we can do now is wait and hope that Henri IV fails in his plans against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN27.A;Maybe if we ignore the problem it will go away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN28.T;Henri IV has been killed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN28.D;Our King has been killed while touring the small town of Castiello de Jaca by a Catalan nationalist, preciving Henri’s Navarro-Aragonese movement as a threat to a Greater Catalan State. This tragic event is further compounded by the fact that our King left no heir to the throne. With the throne vacant we will have to take an extraordinary measure and call for a meeting of the Navarrese Estates. This meeting will exclude the Cortes of Zaragoza and will decide who should lead our country from here on out. It will take some time but The Navarrese Estates should start in about a week from now, hopefully our next monarch meets a better fate than Henri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN28.A;An entire country weeps in his passing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN29.T;Henri IV is dead without heirs ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN29.D;The worst has come to pass as while Henri IV was touring eastern Aragon a Catalan nationalist shot him, preciving Henri’s Navarro-Aragonese movement as a threat to a Greater Catalan State. Now our hold over Navarre is threatened as Henri IV was the last true Bourbon and there is no heir to the throne. The current claimants that could take the throne are either his sister the Countess of St-Sebastian or his illegitimate daughter the Infanta of Bilba. The Countess of St-Sebastian is our preferred candidate as she is married into our royal family, but the issue is to be resolved by the nobles of Navarre. If there were to choose the Infanta of Bilba we could see the loss of Navarre as the Infanta is married to the wife of the dauphin of the Dual Monarchy. We will exert all the influence we have to try and have the Navarrese nobles choose our candidate but there is no certainty that our efforts will succeed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN30.D;The Kingdom of Africa was resurrected from Sicilian titular titles when the Aragonese managed to take a few cities on the coast to break Barbary piracy in the Mediterranean. The conquest of Tunis only cemented the use of the title. Settlement into the African lands followed shortly, and eventually the descendants of those settlers for whatever reasons started calling themselves the Peu-Vermells, or Red Feet. Despite living under one of the Crown for centuries they don’t have a local Cortes to govern them. This has caused tensions between us and the Peu-Vermells. We could create one and naturally fill it with Peu-Vermells and some settlers. However, these Peu-Vermells are often reckless and their arrogance has created grievances with the Berber and Arab populations. We might want a neutral arbiter, say the military, to keep them in check in the Cortes. Finally we could just ignore the Cortes issue and instead rule them directly from the capital. It is sure to anger everyone in Africa but it will help with our centralization. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN30.A;§GThe Cortes shall meet in Cartago and filled with the Peu-Vermells§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN30.B;§WThe Cortes shall meet in Cartago but be supervised by the military§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN30.C;§RYou had me at direct rule.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN31.T;The Sardinia-Corsica Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN31.D;Sardinia and Corsica share much in terms of customs and history and were briefly united under the Kingdom of Sardinia-Corsica in the late Middle Ages. With Corsica a part of the empire, many wonder if the unification of the two islands under one crown could be practical. Their historic ties and geographic closeness makes uniting seem like a reasonable idea. However, of course there is some opposition to this move. On one side the Catalan settlers in Sardinia fear they will lose their political power if more Italians are admitted to their Cortes and on the other the Corsicans, who don’t want to lose the autonomy they enjoyed for centuries. How should we handle these islands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN31.A;Create a united Kingdom of Sardinia-Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN31.B;Create a separate Crown of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN32.T;The Barcelona Cortes Protests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN32.D;When we settled the Sardinia-Corsica issue we did not think the Barcelona Cortes would come into play. Corsica has integrated itself very well into its new role and has even supplanted Sardinia in many ways. This has come at the expense of the Catalan settlers, who mainly live in the cities, as they proclaim they are being discriminated against by both the Sardinians and the Corsicans. The Barcelona Cortes has decided to take up the plight of the Catalans in Sardinia and they demand guarantees for Catalan speakers to ensure them a privileged role in the Kingdom of Sardinia-Corsica. Going forward with such a demand will anger the non-Catalans of Sardinia-Corsica and hurt our ability to govern Sardinia-Corsica, however not taking action will only anger Catalans throughout our empire. What action should we take on this issue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN32.A;§RCatalans in Sardinia have nothing to do with Barcelona!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN32.B;§GIssue an imperial decree to prohibit any discrimination by Corsicans§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN33.T;The New Crown of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN33.D;Corsica retains a deeply clan-based and by some accounts possessing a backwater, pseudo-feudal society and many of our advisors at the Imperial Court advise that the status quo remains in our interests. However, given the current situation the new Kingdom of Corsica is in need of a new ruler. General Marion Tiroligero seems like the most competent out of them all, a capable general in subduing the Brigandagios - Corsican bandits and highwaymen, and combating Italian nationalist sentiment in the island. Despite being accused of being involved in violent reprisals against the locals, he is nevertheless a supporter of change and urgent reform in the island. On the other hand, we might appoint a local from the House of Portoviejo, but that entails that the present Corsican laws and customs be protected from Imperial interference and thus remain unchanged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN33.A;§RAppoint the reformist General.§;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LATIN33.B;§GA low noble from the House of Portoviejo shall take over.§;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LATIN34.T;Les Guerres tarifàries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN34.D;The Principality of Catalonia and its capital, Barcelona was considered as one of the important holdings of the Aragonese Kingdom, but it was often at odds and was gradually outshone by its rival, the Kingdom of Valencia having beaten by kickstarting the industrial revolution in the Crown of Aragon. The formation of the Latin Empire gradually brought on more negatively drastic effects to the longstanding “tariff problem”. Past mercantilist laws dating back as early as the 17th century regarding matters such as internal trade and “cross-border” entrepreneurship have remained an eyesore to the average Catalonian trader - eventually, both industrialist and entrepreneur. This situation may actually hamper our abilities to efficiently collect state taxes and tariffs from both Catalonian-owned traders and companies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN34.A;God, what is happening to this realm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN35.T;The Catalan-Valencian Trade War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN35.D;Numerous Catalonian companies, after several weeks of losses and deficits have panicked over the next course of action, with a couple of entrepreneurs from a famous tobacco company appealing to the Barcelona Tribunal Superior for answers to this conflict. The judges are quick to accuse that the Valencian Cortes was the sole perpetrator of this so-called simmering “trade war”, given their past policies towards Catalonian “hagglers'' and “opportunistic bastards'' allegedly “colluding” with Valencian businesses. The Valencian Cortes responded in kind by threatening an eviction of Catalonian businesses in the country. They have blamed that the Valencian corset industry made by “honest and industrious” Valencian corset-makers were always rivaled by the unfair “preference” of Catalonian-made ones. It seems that this ridiculous issue won’t die for long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN35.A;Really. Women’s undergarments sparked this ‘war’?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN36.T;The Imperial Intervention in The Trade War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN36.D;The Imperial Grand Cortes has convened an emergency discussion on the matter of the Catalan-Valencian trade war. The conservatives and landed nobility alike of course, have decried that the state of the two crowns existing has always been a detriment to the Empire and have suggested the “unification” of the holdings of Catalonia and Valencia to further simplify the country’s near-Byzantine bureaucracy and governance. Erstwhile, Pan-Latin liberals, bureaucrats, autonomist legislators suggest that the best solution would be to keep the two constituent crowns separate. Fearing that outright intervening in the situation would make things much worse they have insisted that the matter of identity shall not be confused with the economy or mere internal matters. At the end of the day, the agenda agreed upon and to be written in law should be:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN36.A;§RMaintain the Status Quo - The crowns are kept separate.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN36.B;§GMerge both Cortes into one crown.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN37.T;The Price of Inaction;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN37.D;The lack of action and the preservation of the status quo by the Imperial Grand Cortes on the division of Catalan speaking Crowns has led to a surge of Llemosi nationalists. They claim that Catalan speakers from both Valencia and Barcelona are one people, oppressed by the “Italian” Empire of Rome that has betrayed its own Catalan roots and foundations, intensified with the proclamation of the Latin Empire as a whole. The conservatives and reactionaries in the Cortes have been proposing that a plebiscite is in order to decide what would be the fate of the Catalans - as a gesture of “kindness” to the unity of the Catalan peoples. The Panlatin liberals however, have shunned this, emphasizing that the Catalan language is a unique character of our plurinational state and must be preserved at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN37.A;§RCatalan is just a language, not a people!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN37.B;§WWe will hold a plebiscite to appease them§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN38.T;The Iberian Malaise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN38.D;It was at dawn when Martí, a hardy man, set off to his place of work in the slum packed streets of Barcelona. Upon arriving, he was startled by the blood-curdling screams of his boss at the furniture workshop of C.A. Montajo, complaining to his contractor on the recent rise in prices of quality pine wood from Savoie & the difficulty of acquiring machinery from Paris due to the unfavorable tariff laws and the trade war taking a toll on Catalan businesses. Martí and his company were soon surprised to hear the unfortunate announcement of lay-offs from his Neapolitan foreman due to “bad news”. Going home, he is both unsure whether or not to tell her beloved Andrea with his five offspring about this and consider a new place of work. It appears that the Iberian Malaise has begun..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN38.A;Will it be that “tragic” though?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN39.T;The Catalan Renaixença;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN39.D;It was at dawn when Martí, a hardy man, set off to his place of work in the slum packed streets of Barcelona. Upon arriving, he was startled to the joyous screams of his boss at the furniture workshop of C.A. Montajo, welcoming the news of all-high profit margins and sales in his company. Surprisingly, the Neapolitan foreman announced a salary increase. Going home with a smile on his face, he is both grateful and perhaps even lucky that he would continue to provide as much to his dear Andrea and their five children. Martí’s eldest son has gained a deep interest in Catalan literature in his language class, becoming deeply invested in Garcia’s and Fontanella’s works and anecdotes at school. At their household, Andrea warmly waits for Martí’s arrival to bug him in sparing at least a couple of denario to get the newest novel by that “amateurish fool” from Guinardó taken out of state censors. It appears that the Catalan Renaixença has begun, due to efforts in deregulating Catalan industry and promoting the arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN39.A;What a touching story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN40.T;The Catalan Miracle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN40.D;Martí is pleased at his job. His boss just keeps showering him with praise and generosity thanks to his hard working character, and his prospects of beating that pesky Neapolitan foreman at his game seems near due to a possibility of a promotion anytime soon. After all, he’s not pleased with the money nor the wealth his job brings. To him - his kids, and his dear Andrea, at the kitchen joyfully whipping up a full three course meal in years, are the only ones that make him glad, as he believes that sooner or later things are going to get better, for the best. The Catalan Miracle has begun, providing immense economic growth and prosperity to all of Catalonia, perhaps even the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN40.A;The taxman will bring Martí to tears anytime soon…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN41.T;A Sudden Twist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN41.D;Approximately a month after the dreary trade war took place, both the Catalonian and Valencian Cortes are always at their throats - arguing every minutiae of law or piece of legislation they could throw at to leverage their aims or even goals to get the other side to fold. Despite this childish game of tit-for-tat among the lawmakers, the fighting seems to have subsided and things are slowly going back as they were before. It seems that they have understood the monarch’s providence over State affairs despite childish meddling… ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN41.A;They should know their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN42.T;Approaching the Papal Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN42.D;We have decided to try and reach out to the Pope with the hopes of beginning a series of negotiations that will put an end to the Papal Question peacefully. We believe that there are three main issues that the Church could bring up during negotiations. The issue of Papal independence, the repayment of confiscated Church property, and the quality of education in our empire. We hope that the Pope will also be interested in solving these issues and agree to negotiate in whatever way he feels would facilitate a lasting peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN42.A;”Holy father, we’ve come to bargain.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN43.T;The Pope agrees to negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN43.D;We have reached out to the Pope and after some back and forth we have settled on how the negotiations are to proceed. Negotiations will take place in the Lateran Palace, the former residence of the Pope and while the Pope will not be there in person, a delegation will be present to present his demands and to negotiate with us. The Pope has made it clear that these negotiations are not a formality and we will have to make concessions if we expect him to sign the final agreement. Regardless we will begin setting up everything in the Lateran Palace and hope that we can resolve the Papal Question in a manner that is satisfactory to everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN43.A;Let’s begin the Lateran Negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN44.T;The Problem of the Papal Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN44.D;Our adherence to Panlatinist ideals have brought us into constant conflict with the Pope. As a result the Pope likes to pretend that we don’t exist and Church officials constantly seem to be working against us. We need to end this state of affairs one way or the other and since we are good Christains we will reach out and try to negotiate with Papal officials. We have found a sympathetic legate and will ask him to present the Pope with our offer of starting negotiations between him and us. We believe that there are three main issues that the Church could bring up during negotiations. The issue of Papal independence, the repayment of confiscated Church property, and the quality of education in our empire. There is no guarantee that these negotiations will take place and if they should fail we will have to resort to other ways to curtail the power of the Church which may only cause more problems for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN44.A;Reach out to the legate and present our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN45.T;Meeting the Legate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN45.D;We have reached out to the Papal legate and after some back and forth we have settled on how the negotiations are to proceed. Negotiations will take place in the Lateran Palace, the former residence of the Pope and while the Pope will not be there in person, a delegation will be present to present his demands and to negotiate with us. The final treaty will then be presented to the Pope and if he finds it adequate we will sign it. While the legate has found these conditions to be satisfactory he admitted that there is no guarantee that the Pope himself will agree to start negotiations. Regardless we will begin setting up everything in the Lateran Palace and hope that we can resolve the Papal Question in a manner that is acceptable to everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN45.A;We will await in the Lateran Palace, we hope the Pope sees reason;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN46.T;The Issue of Papal Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN46.D;The Lateran Negotiations have begun and the first and most pressing issue is the matter of Papal Autonomy. The Papal delegate recognizes that the Papal States will not be returned in full and has instead asked that the Vatican Hill in Rome and the Palais dei Papas in Avignon be given fully under control of the Pope. While the Papacy being in Rome makes sense, the Papal claim in Avignon is more tenuous as Papal influence has been in steep decline in that region and it is commonly accepted that there is no reason for the Pope to be there. Not only that but accommodating these demands will most likely reduce the productivity of these cities by half. We could accept the Papal delegates' demand, or we could push for a compromise and only give them the Vatican while granting them some control over some of the historic churches in Rome along with some more concessions down the line. We could also flat out reject the demand that the Pope should have any independence, however this will most likely doom these negotiations, but it is still an option we could pursue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN46.A;The Pope will get Avignon and Vatican ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN46.B;The Pope will have Vatican and some privileges like the Lateran cathedral;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN46.C;The Pope must abandon ideas of sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN47.T;Restitution to the Church?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN47.D;The Church has brought forth another demand during the negotiations at Lateran. They demand restitution for the seizure of Papal land that occurred during the creation of our Empire. The cost they demand is frankly insane and there is no way we can be expected to pay it. However, in order to try and satiate the Papal delegate a compromise plan has been formed. The Catholic Church will receive an annual stipend of money from the Empire. This stipend will come from a special tax on the people at a rate of 0.8 percent of their annual income. While this tax will negatively affect our own income and the living standards of our people it is the best worst idea we have to try and meet the Church halfway. Should we propose our compromise to the delegates?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN47.A;Eight per thousand tax is best we can propose;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN47.B;The Church is rich enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN48.T;The Matter of Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN48.D;With the Lateran Negotiations wrapping up the Papal delegates have finally brought forth the final expected issue. The Church feels that the education system of our empire is promoting heretical beliefs and is turning people away from God’s light. To this end the delegates have demanded that we reform our education system and mandate Catholic lessons into our curriculum. This includes bringing priests into schools to teach classes, mandatory Bible reading, and the suppression of any topics the Church finds disagreeable. Effectively, this would turn all our schools into Catholic schools. Some members of our government feel that this is a ploy to indoctrinate our youth and, while it will most likely help with literacy in our lands, it is very possible that it will damage our research capabilities. Unfortunately, we don’t have time to debate on this topic and the success of the negotiations may rest on this decision. We must either accept this demand in full or reject it outright. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN48.A;Accept, at least our people will be able to read better;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN48.B;The Church has no business controlling our school system;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN49.T;The Lateran Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN49.D;After many hours of debates and compromises we have finally reached an agreement with the Pope. The Catholic Church will recognize the legitimacy of our government, in return we will follow the stipulations decided during our negoatations. The Lateran treaty has already been signed by both parties and with this the Papal Question has finally been put to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN49.A;A great day for Catholics everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN50.T;The Negotiations Fail ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN50.D;Negotiations between us and the Papal delegates have been tense for a while as the Papal side has made it clear that they feel like we have not been willing to compromise with them. This finally came to a climax today as the Papal delegates walked out of the Lateran Palace declaring the negotiations a farce that only sought the submission of the Church. It appears that any chance of resolving the Papal question peacefully has been dashed and now our only option is to try and break the power of the Church by whatever means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN50.A;I guess peace was never an option;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN51.T;The Fight Against the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN51.D;Our attempt to reach a negotiated settlement with the Pope has failed and it seems apparent that there is no way to reconcile the Church with the State. Our only option now is to try and destroy the influence the Church holds over our people. This is going to be a long fight, but first we must consider what we can utilize with our war against the Church before we begin our campaign in full force. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN51.A;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN52.T;Pardon the Republicans of Etruria?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN52.D;One of the defining aspects of the Etruria Revolution was its aggressive secularization policies against the Catholic Church. Now that we find ourselves against the Church it makes sense to try and copy the Etrurscean model of secularization to remove the influence of the Church on our people. We could go a step further and pardon the republicans of Etruria, who were the first to advocate secularization and bring them into our campaign. While this would greatly help our campaign the republicans have also made it clear that they do not support the Empire as it stands and may only create more problems if we were to release them. Should we gamble and give the republicans amnesty or go with our secularization policy alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN52.A;Pardon the republicans we share a common enemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN52.B;No, the enemy of my enemy here is still our enemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN53.T;Should we Secularize the Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN53.D;Catholicism is the dominant religion in our empire which makes fighting the Catholic Church a herculean effort. Since Catholicism is effectively one and the same as the Church one proposal for removing the power of the Church is the secularization of the empire. This would remove all aspects of religion from our government and devastate the Church’s hold over us and our people. However, going against the Church like this will greatly anger the people, especially as we have constantly built ourselves as God’s chosen ruler of the Empire. We could just focus on limiting the power of the Church but that would take a longer time than the secularization plan. No matter what we do it will anger the Church so should we secularize the empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN53.A;The Church and State must be separate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN53.B;The Church and the State are all but one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN54.T;The Death of Giuseppe I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN54.D;Josep I as he was known in Iberia, Giuseppe I in Italia has peacefully passed on the evening following $DATE_LONG_1$. His death was both melancholic and impactful on the daily lives of Imperial citizens, especially as he had worked on his last days to resolve the issue of the nature of his Empire. The Grand Cortes and the Consell-General at the wake of his death had immediately passed a resolution granting him the unspoken title of “The Magnanimous”, in light of his unwavering love of the Latins and his “unmatched” contributions to the betterment of the Empire. Despite continuing to be the ruler of a new, vast family of Latins, he eventually knew that his time would come. A state funeral shall be held, and his son Balduin Cesare, shall succeed the throne of the Mediterranean’s most feared hegemon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN54.A;The Emperor is dead, Long Live the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN55.T;The Edicts of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN55.D;The Latin Empire has become a solid “community” of states and entities with interweaving laws and customs guaranteeing Imperial stability. Many archaic laws have been revised, in part or whole, to better fit the Empire’s current character and outlook that guarantees the rights of the Crowns and its citizens. The Edicts of Milan, coinciding with the Emperor’s coronation at Rome, were rigorously codified and signed by reformists and liberal-minded statesmen alike, despite severe backlash from traditionalists and the old nobility.\n\nMay the year of our Lord, $YEAR$, mark the dawn of boundless prosperity of the Emperor’s most noble subjects for the forthcoming years and decades to come, someday leading the march to the beat of progress with the world. May we serve true to our purpose of becoming Europa’s guardians. Long Live Emperor Cesare I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN55.A;A Federal Empire of Crowns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN56.T;The Edicts of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN56.D;The Latin Empire has morphed into a patchwork of assorted political entities of all sizes and kinds along with their own customs and traditions. In spite of the obvious bureaucratic quagmire the Realm has become, has also guaranteed the numerous traditions and respect of its constituent entities to the Imperial Seat of Rome, passing these in turn to the promotion of industry and commerce - a new form of “mercantilism”. The edicts of Milan, coinciding with the Emperor’s coronation at Rome, is a “pact” signed by the numerous nobles, princes, bishops, statesmen, etc. swearing oaths of “eternal” fealty to the Latin Emperor..\n\nMay the year of our Lord, $YEAR$, be a testament to our Sovereign’s divine right and guidance over the countless resplendent crowns and lands of his Serene Highness. May his subjects exercise his wise and just rule to the fullest extent for the benefit of Mankind, for God’s Providence is with us. Long Live Emperor Balduin I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN56.A;As expected of an Empire with 400 types of spaghetti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN57.T;The Indomitable Power of Faith and Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN57.D;The Latin Empire has taken on a uniquely “religious” character. With the clergy always having the final say in the affairs and matters of state, it has become remarkable for its bleeding edge bureaucracy and the rigid centralization of the empire’s provinces. In all accounts, the Empire has become one and whole with the Church. The Emperor’s Coronation by the Pope has guaranteed that this current state of affairs shall last for years, with the “unity” of the Faith and Crown being a hallmark of the Latinist ideal.\n\nMay the year of our Lord, $YEAR$, be a testament to our Sovereign’s most serene rule. Along with the Church and the Vicar Of Christ’s guidance, the Empire shall guarantee the safekeeping of the Roman and Catholic faith as its most sacred mission. May God’s grace give our wisest Sovereign the courage he needs to defend and uphold the Catholic faith with his Temporal power and the Pope’s Spiritual might. Long Live Emperor Balduin I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN57.A;Nobody expected that either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN58.T;Renovatio Imperii Romanorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN58.D;The Fates are in our favor. After two millennia of disgrace and dishonor, we have successfully woven once again what could've been ripped apart forever in the vast thread of time. After decades of strife and jostling with states that dotted the entire periphery of Italia, after struggles with the puny Aragonese nobility, we have prevailed. In the year of our Lord, $YEAR$, his Serene Highness Cesare Baldui Serna, at the behest of the Latin Empire’s many princes and fiefdoms, was bestowed upon the title of Imperator of not just Romania, but Romanorum - an Emperor of All Romans.n\nMay the world tremble and gaze at the resurgent and ever-glorious Roman Empire that made Civilization as we know it. And may this glorious day be one of the greatest of all mankind has ever experienced! Aeternitas shall sing our praises until the end of time, and historians will look back in awe of what seemed impossible having been brought back to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN58.A;Salve Romana! Salve Cesare I!;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN59.T;$YEAR$, The Year of Disgrace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN59.D;A shame. Our attempts at formulating edicts upon edicts, laws upon laws and countless concessions given to our vassalages and subjects, a couple misguided and blind fools even had the gall to outright condemn, reject and even scorn our ways. Despite all our struggles and sacrifices to uphold the spirit of a revived and civilized Roman ideal - championing the ever-formidable value of auctoritas, some just fail to see the light and at worst openly mock our attempt to restore Rome. Our spies have received reports of various insurgent cells arming volunteers and fomenting dissent among the populace - all with the aim of undermining Roman rule.\n\nWe must be prepared for the worst, for this year - and the years to come be might be the death knell for all Romans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN59.A;It can not be helped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN60.T;The Crisis of the 19th Century;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN60.D;Instances of massive uprisings have been reported by magistrates and informants in our empire. Imperial garrison forces have been overwhelmed by local insurgents, all wishing to be freed from the “cruel”, “deluded” and “unjust” fool  - that is, allegedly, our own Emperor. Mass reprisals, deportations and even reports of massacres of Latin citizenry and nobility are rampant. Nationalist sentiments have reached a boiling point, without any chance of fizzling out.\nThe Crisis of the 19th Century, a sign of turbulent times to come, has commenced. Despite these grueling reports, many loyalists have rallied across our empire, proclaiming their allegiances to the new Roman ideal. Fools may run and cower - to live another day, but the valiant never taste of death but once. Like in the annals of history we shall be victorious once more, like it has always been..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN60.A;Ita Est.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LATIN61.T;Piano “Vittoria”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN61.D;The unthinkable has happened. During the early morning of this day, rouge army battalions led by traditionalist anti-Latinist officers and nobles stormed key Imperial government sites in Rome: the Palatium Quirinalis, the Imperial Grand Cortes Building, and the War Ministry headquarters. Despite the fierce resistance of pro-Imperial forces it was all for naught, given the ample preparation and effectiveness of the rebels thanks to a vast network of informants that were present months prior. The Emperor presumptive Caesare Baldui was held under house arrest, with the arrest or death of other key state officials. Moments later, the coup leaders gathered at the podium of the Imperial Cortes proclaiming the death of the Latin Empire and with it the Panlatin ideal. Plan “Vittoria” was a success, irregardless of all odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN61.A;Dark times are ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN62.T;The Proclamation of the Roman Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN62.D;The sudden development in Rome seems to have caught the attention of foreign observers and the citizens of the former Empire. One of the coup leaders, Lt. Giulio de Caserta, belonging to the “moderate” faction, has made a quite daring move. With the support of battle-hardened veterans, defectors, and local liberal Roman volunteers, they swiftly crushed the anti-Latinists. Rome was once again saved, taking on a new face: The Roman Republic. Giulio Caserta was proclaimed Consul of Rome also taking on the title of Dictator during the duration of “civil distress” to instill order and civility in the turmoil-filled Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN62.A;Salve Vittoria! Salve Caserta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN63.T;The Latin Turmoil;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN63.D;The issues and efforts concerning our governance of the Empire’s countless crowns and holdings appear to have borne fruit. Our internal policies and governance prior to this date may have been successful to some degree in wresting effective control over our countless Latin holdings and crowns, but as the threat of unrest is unavoidable, we must be ready at the immediate sight of dissent in our lands, come what may. By the passing day and the succession of unfortunate events, Roman flame dims ever further…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN63.A;Post tenebras spero lucem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN64.T;The Lombard Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN64.D;Enraged at the actions unfolding in Rome and coupled with the unpopular sentiment surrounding Roman role, The Lombard territories have unanimously seceded from the Latin crown following a resounding 260-0 vote by the Cortes of Lombardy. Roman forces in the area have either defected to the Lombards or reported to have fled to friendly Imperial territory. Accounts of barbarism against Roman sympathizers are not uncommon despite “official” orders from Milan not to harm Roman citizens. With anti-Imperial sentiment in our Italian holdings running ever intensely high, it is of certain possibility that the sons of the Messiogiorno and Corsica are soon to follow their Lombard brethren-in-arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN64.A;We must deal with this swiftly and at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN65.T;The Neapolitan Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN65.D;Napoli's relationships with the Aragonese Crown and recently, Rome have ebbed and flowed over the centuries. In spite of often amicable relationships, conflicts involving Napoli have impeded their overlord’s capabilities to manage their crowns well. Currently, our relationship with Napoli has ebbed: rippling effects of land reform have taken a toll on the nobility, adversely affecting their relationship with the once-Latin Emperor. The majority reactionary Napolitan Cortes has unilaterally seceded from Rome with their accursed Italian brethren in Lombardy. Rumor has it that due to an “compromise” between the Lombard rebels and the Neapolitan scum, a royal of Gonzagist lineage was selected as the new titular ruler of the Lombard and “Italian” kingdom. War with the Neapolitans seems inevitable, and a highly motivated Neapolitan army on the gates of Rome seems eager to have a taste of its spoils in the coming conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN65.A;Still banding together eh? Maybe they’re the real cowards!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN66.T;The “Cuor di Leone” of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN66.D;In a shocking turn of events, General Tiroligero the “Cuor di Leone”of Corsega has brought us the saddest of news: Despite all his efforts in subduing the Brigandagios and revolutionary sentiment in the island, the Year of Disgrace seems to have rendered this task nigh impossible due to a renewed and relentless rebel offensive that led to the capture of Ajaccio just recently. Instead of planting his feet firmly on the ground, fighting to the last man like a real Roman, he turned tail and fled on an Army sloop bound for Roma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN66.A;A shameful display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN67.T;The Neapolitan Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN67.D;Napoli's relationships with the Aragonese Crown and recently, Rome have ebbed and flowed over the centuries. In spite of often amicable relationships, conflicts involving Napoli have impeded their overlord’s capabilities in managing their lands and fulfilling their ambitions. Currently, our relationship with Napoli has ebbed: rippling effects of land reform have taken a toll on the nobility, adversely affecting their relationship with the once-Latin Emperor. The majority reactionary Napolitan Cortes has unilaterally seceded from Rome, with a temporary Regent in place to allow an open discussion to whom shall take the title of King. War with the Neapolitans seems inevitable, and a highly motivated Neapolitan army on the gates of Rome seems eager to have a taste of its spoils in the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN67.A;Hopefully we shall make amends… on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN68.T;The Corsican Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN68.D;The landed clans of Corsica have broken off from Rome. Their steadfast adherence to tradition, despite being a huge slump to island’s continuous development and progress, has actually proven beneficial as a whole, managing to stem the tide of Italian nationalism due to the often “effective” relief programs brought by the landed nobility that promoted the idea of “work for bread” to the locals. Despite these good news the nobility, wishing not the bear the economic impact of the Crisis the Corsicans have seceded from our authority for the meantime whilst maintaining its neutrality in the unraveling conflict .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN68.A;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN69.T;The Hydra Resurfaces Once More;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN69.D;For the third time, the Etrurian revolutionary old guard have gathered at the city Florence to discuss their plans to seize the opportunity of reigniting the old flame of 1808 and the Revolutions of the 40s.Their plans have apparently been sped up due to the immediate and unfortunate succession of events at Rome and the Roman government being virtually incapacitated to swiftly purge any dissent on its soil.\n\nThe Revolutionary Hydra has re-emerged from the abyss, poising to bring the intoxicating idea of Italian revolutionary nationalism to our lands once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN69.A;Perhaps the third time shall be their last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN70.T;The Secession of the African Holdings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN70.D;Our African holdings on the Mediterranean coast have been affected tremendously by the abrupt disruption of Roman rule. With the Peu-Vermells worrying over the potential loss of their fledgling enterprises and the gradual entrenchment of the Peu-Vermell identity, the local government has seceded from Rome to “save face” while keeping themselves within Rome’s graces by refusing to take a side in any potential internal conflict within the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN70.A;We shall expect their loyalty once we emerge from this mess;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN71.T;La Despedida;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN71.D;When the cat is gone, the rats dance. - Catalan proverb\n\nThe most troubling news has reached the shores of the Eternal City. The Catalan Cortes at Barcelona, with the support of a certain ambitious and popular army corporal named Rodier Ascaso, has gained a large gathering of disgruntled city and country folk which were badly hit by the side effects of the Tariff Wars. The economic situation in our Catalan holdings, compounded with Rome’s various troubles in restoring order to its lands ennobled the reemergence of a Catalonian identity  if not dealt with with haste can lead to our immediate loss of our Iberian holdings that we held so dearly from our descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN71.A;What of them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN72.T;The Bello Civili of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN72.D;The air of vengeance draws nigh. Civilizations have fallen not to massive invasions nor conquest, but from the internal meddling of its subjects. As such, Ancient Rome’s pluricultural character, while having its merits, was one of its major faults. Combined with severe economic and internal repercussions, said dilemma is a recipe for rebellions and other conflicts in the once mighty ancient power. Mirroring the tragedies of old, it appears that the same fate has befallen upon the revived Roman state, much very less subject to a magnitude of these calamitous events.\n\nShall the reborn Rome stand united against the bands of traitors upon traitors and barbaric “nationalists''- emerging as the heralds welcoming the dawn of a new Roman era? Or shall history prove as our best teacher once again - a result of our reckless ambitions coming historians will scrutinize and lament in their texts? The battle lines are drawn. the Legions march again, ranks formed, unfurling their standards and firmly gripping their rifles with Elysium’s oath: the Bello Civili has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN72.A;Alea iacta est;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN73.T;The Roman Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN73.D;The time of action is upon us. Our deluded enemies have drawn their swords and await us in the fields of battle. There is no “Roman” civilization - a fallen and dead idea incompatible with the current times. With other nations finally free from the “Roman” yoke, open conflict is inevitable. Foolishingly enough, may this be a lesson to those who play a deranged game of make-pretend without taking reality and rationality to account.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN73.A;We shall feast upon Roma’s corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN74.T;Damnatio Romanum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN74.D;The Fates have abandoned us. Rome’s sons have struggled against all odds, fighting tooth and nail, filled with tales and feats of heroism that will be sung by generations to come. In spite of all these valiant efforts, it was all for naught. The Eternal City was now a former husk of itself: a lifeless and decrepit corpse. Rome’s maidens wail in the loss of their sweethearts, spouse and offspring alike, forgotten in the fields of Latium for eternity. Violent and bloody reprisals against Roman citizenry en masse have spared no one in spite of pleas of mercy from the International Concert.\n\nCybele wept and wailed endlessly for the carnage her children have been subjected to, while the departed long for Venus’ embrace. With the Roman government virtually shattered by the continuous onslaught and rendered nonexistent, the Roman idea is effectively dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN74.A;Mors Vincit Omnia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN75.T;The Roman Triumph;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN75.D;An atmosphere of awe dominates the mood of the vast crowds gathered at Rome. The victorious outcome of the Civil War has defied even the expectations of foreign observers. Foreign officials all over the world and commoners have gathered at Rome for this momentous occasion. The Triumphalis Romani is one of the most elaborate and extravagant processions held in the history of mankind. A three hour military parade followed by an elaborate procession showcasing the beauty of the Latin Peoples and achievements, ending with the conferral of titles of Augustus and “Restitutor Orbis” to our beloved ruler.\n\nThe magnanimous Romans have reclaimed their place as the rightful heirs of Romulus’ legacy. May this victory be a testament to the tenacity of all Romans, unflinching at the sight of adversity ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN75.A;Gloria Romae!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN76.T;The Revival of the Lega Lombarda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN76.D;The Liga Lombarda, or the Lombard League was an historical pact of Northern Italian states formed in 1167, opposing the encroachment of the Holy Roman Empire into the Italian peninsula. Ever rising tensions with the Lombards, combined with the wave of nationalist Romanticism among the Lombards stirred the feelings of animosity of Latin expansionism and clerical hatred made an old idea anew. One by one the Lombard territories have seceded from Rome’s grasp culminating in a joint declaration by Lombard secessionists in Milan establishing a confederal “Lega” of Lombard states. With reports of mass expulsions and violent clashes between Latin citizens, it seems that our hold on the North has slipped away. The faithful must be ready, as Satan’s spawn has come down on the lands beyond the Po.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN76.A;There shall be gnawing and gnashing of teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN77.T;Damnatio Romanum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN77.D;The faithful soldiers of God, filled with never-ending courage and vigor in their struggle for the Roman ideal and the Catholic faith, lie vanquished despite their efforts. Rome lies in ruins: a husk of its former self, with the ever-sacred grounds of the Holy See left not unspared. The faithful are united in sorrow and outrage over the news of “anticlerical terror” perpetrated by radicals and anticlericals alike, resulting in the death of countless innocent faithful and Catholic clergy, along with the plunder and desecration of many Christian artifacts. .\n\nThe Pope has called upon the intercession of the Virgin Mary for the fallen, while the departed long for prayers to spare them from purgatory and the horrors of hell. On the bright side, The Holy See has been given immunity thanks to foreign intercession, but the Pope nonetheless is in chains once more, reduced to a mere prisoner of his vanquishers. With the Latin government virtually shattered by the continuous onslaught and rendered nonexistent, an idea of a Catholic Latin state is effectively dead. It appears God has abandoned us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN77.A;Blessed are the mournful, for they shall be comforted;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN78.T;The Catholic Triumph;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN78.D;Here ye, all you faithful, for our dear Sovereign has preserved our Lord’s sovereignty over the Earth’s nations. The choirs of angels on high exalt their praises for our victory over Satan itself - the wretched Lombard horde sent by Lucifer to ravage His lands and evict the children of God from whom have toiled endlessly these lands as stewards of his Creation. Our warriors have proven their mettle, going stronger day by day against all adversity - until the enemy is crushed, and to this we shall bask in glory for centuries to come.\n\nWe extol praises to you, O Lord, for this day we have restored civilization to the world. As King of all Nations we are eternally grateful for this most blessed day that marked the dawn of a new Catholic Empire thanks to the efforts of the Vicar of Rome's spiritual guidance and the Emperor's formidable temporal power exercising Your will. We stand triumphant and ready to serve you until the ends of the Earth, for God has willed it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN78.A;Gloria Excelsis Deo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN79.T;The Estranged Cousin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN79.D;Occitania has always had deep ethnolingustic and cultural ties with the peoples of our Empire, yet centuries of foreign rulers, bloodshed and hersey has drove the Occitanan’s apart from the faithful.\n\nWith the lands of southern France now within the Empire’s control, maybe it is time to crusade against the injustice which has drove our people’s apart. We could ‘convince’ the Protestant majority to revert back to the true faith by clamping down on the heretical churches and their preaching ceremonies; which will strangle the main form of political power these heretical priest’s have. This may ruffle a few feather’s amongst the masses but if implemented, they shall know where the true faith resides: under Rome and under our protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN79.A;Occitania has already known a Crusade, why not another?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN79.B;A crusade? What’s this, the 1000s?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN790.T;A Plea from the Archbishop of Aix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN790.D;We have received a telegram from the Archbishop of Aix earlier today, a catholic and a mediator in the Occitan community; he has sent a warning to the local Imperial government that any further provocation of the Protestants will lead to violence. The Archbishop has further called for that the local Occitan Protestants be allowed to practice their Christain faith in peace, as cited in the bible to love thy neighbor or there will be violence.\n\nWe have the chance to grant these heretics a special status in the Empire, which will be seen as a victory for heretics across the Empire in favour for peace or to carry on with the rightful Catholicization of the Occitans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN790.A;Clamp down on these heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN790.B;Grant them autonomy to exercise their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN80.T;Occitan Protestant Agitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN80.D; Cities in the Midi have broken out into riots and general disorder. Cities such as Toulouse (and many others) broke into protest and strike action against our crusade against the Protestant church within Occitan. Although troops and local police have been able to contain these strikes and general Occitan backlashes, the agitation seems to have spread amongst the whole populace.\n\nWine bars in Occitan have seen the removal and burning  of the portrait of the Emperor. Graffiti now lines the walls across Occitan, calling for revolution; inspired by the great German revolutions to liberate Occitan and even strike against Rome, the Emperor and the Papacy itself. Such agitation has been countered with arrests against ringleaders, additional catholic sermons and parades celebrating the unity of the Empire. However, no amount of imperial propaganda and catholic preaching will hide the cracks beginning to form in Occitan . ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN80.A;Give it time… They’ll learn eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN81.T; The Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN81.D;Despite our clamp down on the heretic clergy and even the banishment of the openly critical pastors, the Occitan show no sign of abandoning their faith in mass. In secret, they gather in the open countryside, in “Desert assemblies” for they have begun to compare their persecution to the Exodus and the travel of Moses throughout the Desert. There, prophets speak to the assembly of the need for resistance. A certain Daniel Mazel has thus said to have received a vision from God to cast away “the fat black bulls who feed upon the cabbages of the holy garden”, and a day later, a Jesuit priest from a neighboring village was nearly lynched to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN81.A;”Nearer my God to thee, Nearer to thee…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN82.T;The Liga de la Jove Republica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN82.D;Reports from the chiefs of the Imperial police in Occitan have highlighted a new political and revolutionary party in Occitan. This new Protestant socialist party has become a rallying point for the agitator’s, revolutionaries and Protestants within Occitan who oppose our rule. The name of this party is the ‘Liga de la jove Republica’- the league of the Young Republic.\n\nThe League has called for the removal of Imperial rule from Occitan; the abolishment of Catholic supremacy over Occitania and most frighteningly of all, a secular socialist republic to be formed within Occitan. Already flocks of socialist’s have seeped from abroad,  into Occitan to help the league fight against the ‘Catholic Jackboot’. The local authorities have also highlighted that no matter the amount of arrests and crackdowns, the League seems to bounce back ever stronger thanks to local populist donations and support from the middle class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN82.A;Formation of the Liga de la jove Republica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN83.T;The Occitan Federation of Communes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN83.D;The Occitanian ‘League of the Young Republic’ has declared earlier today, that the shackles of Imperial rule shall be cast off and a new socialist republic based on a federation of local Communes shall be the sole legal and federal authority in Occitan. The declaration was made in front of a Young Republic mob, which stormed the Cathedral in Marseille and lynched the govenor of Marseille within its holy walls. Luckily the Archbishop was able to flee, but scenes of violence against imperial governance alongside desecration of Catholic grounds have happened across the whole of Occitania.\n\nIn Tolon, local garrisons of Occitan descent have turned against Imperial troops, helping mobs to storm arsenals and stockpiles designated for our troops. These mobs have thus created the first units of a ‘revolutionary guard’ which during the day have multiplied across Occitan, fighting the ragtag units of local police and garrisons still loyal to the Emperor and the faith. A full scale revolutionary war has emerged, one which can shake the foundations of the Empire apart..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN83.A;Holdfast in the name of God and Order! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN84.T;His Holiness’ Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN84.D;We have received a telegram from Vatican City demanding we prevent the ascension of a socialist government. The pope fears that this new government will encourage atheist and anti-christian organizations around the country, which he considers a betrayal of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN84.A;A relief for the messenger of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN85.T;Rerum Novarum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN85.D;The Pope has recently issued a new Papal Bull called Rerum Novarum or The Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor. While it rejects Socialism and encourages workers to refrain from violence and disobedience the Bull still advocates for the formation of trade unions and for the introduction of collective bargaining. Not only that but the Bull goes further and says employers should ensure their workers health, safety, and the right to a living wage. The Bull does speak out against collective ownership saying that it is the natural right of man. In the end this Papal Bull has rewakened the need for moralism within capitalism within our people, however for others they see this Bull as a call for further Socialist action and already they have begun organizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN85.A;I’m getting some mixed signals here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN86.T;The Latin Spring;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN86.D;Our attempts to create a united empire of the Aragonese and Italian peoples have failed, the instability caused by the many revolutions and our overly ambitious attempts to centralize the country has led to a disastrous revolution, one too big to put out, leaving us nothing else to do but sit and watch as our dreams of an empire vanish before our eyes, like ashes upon the wind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN89.T;The Counterpapal Decree;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN89.D;With the success of the Republic we have decided to sideline the Pope and remove the undo Catholic influence over the our politics.

LATIN89.A;Finally we are free.;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN90.T;Revocation of the Lateran Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN90.D;With the success of the Socialist Revolution we have decided to revoke the Latern Treaty that was created between the old Royalist government and the Papal authorities. We have made it clear to the Pope that we are no longer beholden to the terms of the treaty and will henceforth conduct our business independent of the church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN90.A;And may His Holiness not haunt us forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN91.T;Restore the Lateran Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN91.D;The Revolution has been defeated, and we should seek rapprochement with the Cathloic Church. We have announced that we shall restore the Lateran Treaty and abide by the terms within it. While it won’t make up for the suffering the church as endured we hope that they will see we are working in good faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATIN91.A;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATIN95.T;The Jerusalem Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LATIN95.D;Jerusalem is mostly a tranquil place, with the Jews, Western Christians, Armenians and Muslims living at peace with each other. But yesterday, an incident between an Italian pilgrim, a priest called Giulio and a Muslim mufti escalated into a full blown massacre after a Muslim was killed by a pilgrim wielding a gun. The killer escaped to a nearby Church, claiming he only drew his weapon for protection and after the refusal of the priest to give him to the authorities, a week of troubles erupted throughout the city that spared no communities, with even the local Jews caught in the middle of the riots. The local authorities have counted for at least 75 dead but it has created resentment abroad, notably among the Christian powers of Europe..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LATIN96.T;The Jerusalem Massacres;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LATIN96.D;”'The Christian inhabitants were put to the sword under circumstances of unparalleled barbarity, the assailants being Muslims under the command of the local commander Ismail-al-Atrash.

The only worthy course for the government of $COUNTRY$ should be an intervention to cause the rights of justice and humanity to triumph.” - The Valencian Herald\n\nViolence in Jerusalem has erupted last month, although reports are contradictory about who was the cause of the riot that led to nearly a week of troubles in the Holy City. This gives us the perfect excuse to demand for a special province to be created in Palestine, with special rights for our agents to avoid such a thing to happen again..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LATIN97.D;Following the troubles in Jerusalem, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded we establish a special Mutasarrifate in Palestine. While the province will still formally remain under our ownership, $FROMCOUNTRY$ also demands that a special representative from their country be put into a position of power in order to protect the Christian people in those lands. This would give $FROMCOUNTRY$ great influence in the running of the Mutasarrifate and it could even lead to them completely detaching Palestine from us. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made it clear that if we do not agree to these demands then military intervention will most likely follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Upon reaching the city he entered by foot and followed a route traveled by many pilgrims. He then visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where after our $MONARCHTITLE$ kissed the cross offered by the auxiliary-bishop of Jerusalem he was subsequently crowned the King of Jerusalem. The $MONARCHTITLE$ spent the rest of this time in the city visiting the churches of various Christain denominations, synagogues, and even Al-Aqsa Mosque. Our $MONARCHTITLE$ did this to try and reassure everyone that Jerusalem will remain open to all brothers of the abrahamic faith and their rights to practice will not be infringed. However, many are unconvinced by this, due to reports of mistreatment of jews in our European lands, and mistreatment of muslims in our African lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LATIN106.D;Now that the Coronation is over, there is much work ahead for the Imperial government. The decentralized nature of the Aragonese Monarchy, sometimes called 'the pactist monarchy' by scholars was a hindrance for the Royal Power alongside strenghtening the nobility from each Crown. With the Emperor now crowned and the basis of our state established, it is time for the government to handle the creation of this new Realm by handling the issues plaguing each Crown. The Emperor is eager to §Rcentralize the Realm§ by reducing the autonomy of each Crown but many ask to keep the §Ykeep the decentralization§ so that it is enshrined within the Empire. Too much centralization will easily provoke revolts and issues but the decentralization may not allow the Empire to truly wield its power in this new age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

invade_kingdom_of_merica_larp_desc;The unclear status of the territories of the once Kingdom of Mercia were a source of tensions between Spain and Aragon for centuries.

ARI_secure_adriatic_desc;For centuries, the Crown of Aragon has been hellbent on obtaining supreme naval dominance over the Mediterranean. Despite having made inroads controlling key naval ports and attempts at acquiring maritime holdings through diplomacy their efforts amounted to little.

NAV1.T;Basque Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him. What will possibly happen??;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now their representative has reminded us of the old Plantagent claim to the Kingdom of Navarre...a claim they may pursue if we continue our defiance. Some members of the cabinet wish to reaffirm our defiance, but others see an opportunity to use the Anglois' threats as an excuse to dissolve our ties to Aragon - even if we may only end up replacing them with the Dual Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV2.D;The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his dreams of independence. He reasoned that Aragon is decaying and through our historic and cultural ties with the Pamplonan Crown, it is our duty to intervene on his behalf. Yet, our advisors are alarmed: Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead and might retaliate. Nonetheless, Henry IV awaits an answer. Our strength might be enough to scare off Barcelona, but they nonetheless might escalate it into a war. If we don't help Henry IV, Spain might use this chance alone to finally free the Basque from the Aragonese yoke. But we could use this opportunity to gain a client state in Euskadia, although this would anger our long-time friend and ally Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They stormed the Supreme Court in Bilbao, they stormed the forts in the Pyrenees and at our borders to our Iberian brethren and they stormed the royal palace of Pamplona.

NAV15.T;The Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV15.D;Navarra has proclaimed its allegiance to Spain! They have expelled our representatives with the support of Spain and the Dual Monarchy of England-France. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries. But if we do so, we will have to face Spain and the Anglois Monarchy, a task which is surely beyond our capabilities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

987415.B;It can't end this way! Declare war!;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV16.T;Aragon accepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV16.D;The Aragonese delegates seemed tired when approaching our government. "We regret the decision of the people of Euskadia, but the current political tensions between the Crown of Aragon and its neighbours do not allow for hotheaded actions against such minor losses. Be assured that your choice was the wrong one, but the king is wishing you good luck for your new journey in this brave, new world." Aragon formally accepted our plea, meaning that we have narrowly avoided a war for our cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
987416.A;Good riddance, Barcelona!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
NAV17.T;Basque Independence Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV17.D;Our efforts were done in vain. All of our neighbors refused to help us. We have done everything we could, but it was not enough. Truly, a sad day for Navarra. Not to mention the anger of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV18.D;Bad luck has struck Spain today. Our centuries-old former friends in Paris, the Anglo-French Dual Monarchy, have ignored our claims on the Kingdom of Navarra and influenced the ruling traitor Henry IV to such a degree that the Basque from now on are puppet of the Plantagenets.

NAV20.D;The death of three high-ranking Spanish military officials prompted a quick and aggressive reaction from Spain. They accused the government in Pamplona and Paris to conspire against the Iberian people due to our new beginning in Euskadia and are starting to invade Navarra to "reclaim their rogue lost territory".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
987420.A;They will regret that.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
NAV21.T;Death of Henry IV of Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;; #Should now only happen if NAV9 isn't triggered
NAV21.D;The Bourbon dynasty has seen fewer and fewer male members born these last years. The last true Bourbon, descendant of Hugh Capet has died in Pampeluna yesterday. He leaves two possible heirs : his sister, the countess of St-Sebastian married into the Aragonese royal family, and the infante of Bilbao, his illegimate daughter married to the Dauphin of England-France. The Navarran Estates have gathered to choose who will succeed to Henry and thus in which country Navarra will be closer tied with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV22.T;England-France and Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV22.D;The Navarran Estates decided to choose the unlikely candidate, wive of our dauphin, the Infante of Bilbao, as their new queen. This may very well result in a personal union between the two kingdoms, in the case that our current king passes away. Aragon is not very fond of that outcome and already issued their diplomats back to Barcelona to discuss further proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A lot has changed and while Finland may now seem at peace, new ideologies and agitations stir the crestfallen and disaffected inhabitants of the region.

SCAFIN1.T;The Finnish National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN1.D;The Finnish National Awakening is a long period of political and cultural ferment in Finland and Karelia roughly starting with the publication in 1835 of the Kalevala, a compendium of Finnic oral poetry and legends. Finnic nationalism has spread among the finnish-speaking educated middle class, starting from the foundation in 1838 of the Sampo Society in Borgå as a direct response to the Three Crowns Act. Inner Finland and Karelia have lagged behind due to their rural conformation, but the growing discontent with Scandinavian rule and fears of Russian expansionism have given rise to a distinct Karelian national sentiment of lower class origin. Despite their differences, Finnish and Karelian nationalism share the same ambitions of Finnic unity -for now- and self-rule, unlike the heavily Scandinavianized Ostrobothnian and Helsingforsian nobility, who are loyal to the idea of integral union with the mainland, despite their patronage of Finnish culture. The Finns will soon challenge Copenhagen's indifference and ask to reconsider the status of Finland within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN2.T;The Finns request a National Diet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN2.D;Three weeks ago in Helsingfors, a public debate organized by the nationalist Sampo Society about the proposal to make Finnish a co-official language of Österland has derailed into a full fledged popular consultation regarding Scandinavian rule in the region. Despite the swift dissolution of the assembly by the police, a group of seven intellectuals has written a four page manifesto based on the proposals and the complaints gathered during the consultation. The document has been summarized in a public letter addressed to our sovereign asking to convene a National Finnish Diet to redefine Finland's status within the realm. The letter has been signed by many famous and influential intellectuals and politicians, like Count Jakob Stiernhielm, with the hope of raising awareness among Scandinavian mainlanders about Finland's problems. The Finnic nationalist front is still developing and lacks cohesion, but it's not at all certain that we could get rid of them in one go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN3.T;The National Diet of Helsingfors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.D;170 delegates from all lands belonging to the the Gulf of Bothnia have been convened in the New City Hall of Helsingfors to define Finland's new constitutional order. Thus far, nationalist delegates from Karelia and Southern Finland have formed a "Autonomist" party with the support of some Ostrobothnians deputies who had signed the Petition for a National Diet. All other Ostrobothnians are staunchly opposing every attempt to remove Copenhagen's political control over the activities of the future Senate. As deputies frequently change their official stance from autonomist to conservative and viceversa there's no way to predict who will gain the upper hand. However, the next daily session will be open by our Prime Minister, who will subtly warn Karelian delegates that those who claim to be their ally against the Scandinavian "tyrant" may prove to be far harsher masters. If this manages to put a flea in their ears we might create a rift between the two nationalities. We await future developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191918.A;It will be the pivotal moment of this Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.D;Despite the Prime Minister's barefaced attempt to break the Autonomist front, Finnish and Karelian deputies preserved their political unity for several days, until the reckless suggestion of making Finnish the sole official language of the new nation shifted a sizeable group of moderate Scandinavian-speaking and Karelian deputies towards anti-independence positions. The breakaway group allowed the Ostrobothnian faction to win by a narrow margin a series of crucial votes. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland has been solemnly sent to our monarch by the Diet's President. The Finns will benefit from a less centralised local administration and some economical privileges, but the new Senate will have no effective scrutiny ability over the Copenhagen appointed plenipotentiary, Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson. As the title "Grand-Duchy" suggests, there's no equal political status with the other Nordic kingdoms and foreign affairs are entirely under Scandinavian control. This will not quell the Finns' rumbling for long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191919.A;I dare them to come back asking for more after this unprecedented concession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.D;The Prime Minister's effrontery has had the opposite effect than that expected, strengthening nationalist positions and unity, thus exacerbating the clash between Scandinavian-speaking Ostrobothnians and radicalised independentists. After a fight between two deputies had interrupted a session of the Diet, the Ostrobothnian delegation decide to abandon the Chamber and return home, declaring that they will have nothing more to do with the Finns. The Rump Diet has nonetheless written a surprisingly moderate Constitution for the Kingdom of Finland. Copenhagen will retain substantial control over the Senate and the new National Diet, but the Finnish Army will be completely independent from Scandinavia's. The Helsingforsian nobility mourns the birth of a nation that publicly denounced them as traitors and awaits the time it will return under direct mainlander protection as Ostrobothnia. The Finns got what they wanted, but they won't be able to escape Scandinavian control any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191920.A;With an absolute king this would never have happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.T;The Karelian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.D;After a brilliant speech by our Prime Minister, fight has erupted between Finnish and Karelian nationalists. Divisive questions like the recognition of Karelian language have been brought to the surface, putting at risk the solidarity between Finnic nationalities. Recent votes have shown a steady growth of the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction, but victory can not be claimed yet. The most prominent Finnish delegates are trying to mend this fracture in time for the crucial decisions on the new Senate's powers by promising autonomy and other substantial concessions. In the last few days, however, a pamphlet asking for a separate Karelian Diet has spread like wildfire in Helsingfors. Finnish and Karelian delegates call it a petty provocation, but they can't deny it well represents the feelings of some representatives of the Eastern Frontier. We can only wait until the proceedings of the Diet reach a conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191921.A;They want another Diet?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.T;The Autonomists reconcile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.D;Despite the staunch opposition of Copenhagen's most loyal supporters, the new autonomist Constitution of the Kingdom of Finland has been approved by a wide margin. After the emergence of separatist positions within the Karelian delegation many thought that the fractured Diet would be locked in a stalemate. Instead, the prompt reply of some Finnish nationalists leaders regrouped the Autonomist faction and marginalized the supporters of the "Karelian Diet Petition". The momentum gained by this display of internal cohesion permitted the approval of some radical autonomist proposals, often deleterious for the privileges of Scandinavian-speaking citizens. Copenhagen's control over the Senate and the new National Diet will be minimal. Scandinavia loses a precious piece of its Baltic dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191922.A;This is the end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.T;The Karelian March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.D;The intrinsic contradictions of the Finnic nationalist movement have been exposed, leading to the dissolution of the Autonomist party. Finnish deputies have regrouped and radicalised triggering a similar reaction in the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction. As the polarized Diet approached a stalemate, the authors of the Karelian Diet Petition made themselves public and called for a sabotage of the anti-Karelian Helsingfors Diet. As eastern deputies returned to their constituencies, the Finnish National Diet was dissolved, resulting in bare minimum changes to the status quo. However, as proposed by General Johan Von Ascheberg, Finnish nationalism can be defeated once an for all only if the South and the East stay divided. He therefore proposes the creation of a militarized "Karelian March" to defend our Eastern Frontier and quell all future separatist feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191923.A;A brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.D;Divergences between Finnish and Karelians nationalists have benefited the Ostrobothnian-led conservative party, leading to a rejection of many autonomist proposals. When came the pyrrhic reconciliation of the two nationalities, the most uncompromising Karelian deputies had already teamed up with the moderates, giving them a decisive majority in the Diet. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland was solemnly sent to the monarch by the Diet's President. The Copenhagen-appointed Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson has almost complete control over the legislative process, with the ability to dissolve the new National Diet and nominate ministers at will. His Minister of Defence, General Johan Von Ascheberg, has transferred the control of most of the Eastern Frontier to the Scandinavian army, citing the strategic importance of the region. The Karelians, who hoped to gain a favourable arrangement at the expense of their southern cousins, are now blocked in a situation far worse than the one they started with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191924.A;This solution does not seem destined to last long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.T;The Riksdag of the Estates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.D;After decades of inactivity, the Riksdag of the Estates of Sweden has been convened in the House of Nobility of Stockholm to determine the new status of Österland within the Scandinavian realm. Copenhagen's Landsting has contested the legitimacy of such assembly, whose powers had been delegated de facto to the new unified chamber of the Empire, but an intervention of the Prime Minister made clear that the convocation of a kingdom's estates currently is an inappellable personal prerogative of the Monarch. As deputies from Denmark and Norway had forewarned, the opening of the Riksdag rekindled Stockholm's desire for autonomy and decentralization, transforming the Finnish Question in a challenge to Copenhagen's authority. The constitutional foundations of our nation will undergo drastic changes regardless of the decisions made by the estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191925.A;Scandinavia will forever stand united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.D;A speech by our monarch has officially closed the Riksdag of the Estates, putting an end to the farce of the Swedish barons. The Stockholm assembly was forced to realize its complete lack of effective political powers and the results of its workings can be considered ceremonial, at best. The Grand Duchy of Finland has been carved out of Sweden's territory and as the name suggests its status is not equal compared to the three constituent kingdoms of the Empire. The Copehagen Landsting has had its revenge, but the Riksdag's damage is done and now the Prime Minister has to appoint a Governor-General to formally deal with the powerless National Diet of Finland. The Finns have returned east feeling teased and mortified by the paternalism of the Swedes and they will surely come back asking for more autonomy. Copenhagen must now demonstrate the full capabilities of the central government, maybe by giving exceptional powers to the Governor-General in Helsingfors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191926.A;Carl Anders Torstensson will be our trusted man in Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.T;The Instrument of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.D;Long negotiations with the representatives of the Finnish Estates have lead to the adoption of a new Instrument of Government for the Kingdom of Sweden, officially changing its name to the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Finland. Stockholm celebrated what was widely regarded as the creation of a Swedish Empire within Scandinavia, but the first Finnish-speaking delegates at the Landsting in Copenhagen were vocal in denouncing the paternalism of the Swedes and the absence of true political reform. They officially appealed to the Chamber representing the Empire as a whole asking to grant to all Finns effective citizenship rights and protection, within and outside the borders of the Kingdom. This is the perfect opportunity to reaffirm Copenhagen's authority: we must seize the Finnic lands just across our border and prove once more that our country is strong and united. But if we pursue in our inaction, it won't be just the Eastern Frontier that will search for alternative solutions to our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191927.A;We must safeguard Finland and Karelia from the Eastern menace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.T;The Helsingfors Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.D;As foretold by months of growing unrest, fighting has erupted in the streets of Helsingfors after a peaceful demonstration of the Sampo Society was dispersed by the police. The popular neighbourhoods are completely out of control and the chief of the city police has been shot while supervising an assault to a barricade. The representative of the Scandinavian government has left the city in secret and is now trying to organize a retaliation from the Sveaborg Fortress, in the nearby archipelago. As the news reached the rest of the country, other Finnish cities have followed Helsingfors' fate and some border garrisons manned by Finnish and Karelian recruits have mutinied. Copenhagen promised equity and protection to its Finnic subjects, but its despotic rule over the region and the complete indifference for the cries of help coming from across the border have depleted the Finnish patience and trust. Nationalism reaches its natural outcome: a Finnish War of Independence is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191928.A;We will strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.T;The Pacification of the Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.D;With the expulsion of the Slavic invaders, Karelia is united once and for all under the aegis of Scandinavia. Copenhagen has fulfilled its promise to the Finnic nation and now the Landsting can rightfully claim to be the only representative body of all the Nordic peoples. Finnish nationalism will not bother Scandinavia for a long long time, but it will not disappear completely. The hard-earned harmony must be secured from the ambitions of its enemies in the East and in the South, by all means necessary. As our Empire is more united now than it has ever been, we must use this new-found strength to impose our peace on the entire Baltic basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191929.A;A tough chapter ends and a glorious one begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.T;The Great Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.D;After their underwhelming first attempt, the Sampo Society has organized an unprecedented collection of signatures throughout Finland and Karelia with the volunteer help of university students. The meticulous organization of the campaign has resulted in the collection in less than two weeks of over three hundred thousand nominatives, which have been delivered to the Royal Palace in Copenhagen by a delegation of the Society, lead by Count Jakob Stiernhielm and the self-exiled Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise. The recent years of mismanagement of the region have compacted the nationalist front, which has put aside regionalist interferences in favour of pan-Finnic unity, so it might not be possible to hush again separatist sentiments. Were the petition be rejected, the agitators will have their perfect chance to proclaim that Copenhagen does not care for its subjects across the Gulf of Bothnia and this may lead to open rebellion. It seems like we have no choice but to assent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.A;This petition is wasted paper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.B;Maybe this way we can avoid a useless war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.T;The National Diet of Åbo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.D;The Estates of Finland have convened in the main building of the former Royal Academy of Åbo, known as Turku in Finnish, to define once and for all Finland's status within the Scandinavian Realm. The hemicycle is almost perfectly split in half between the self styled "Fennoscandian Party", favourable to the draft articles proposed by the Copenhagen Landsting, and the autonomist deputies, who have adopted the appellation of "Kalevalists", satirically used by a Stockholmer newspaper. The president of the National Diet, Duke Erik Mannerheim, has painstakingly maintained the balance between the two groups, but as the debate advances, Fennoscandians and Kalevalists espouse increasingly divergent and irreconcilable stances. The Finns face the final choice between full citizenship and protection within Scandinavia, as promised by Copenhagen, or the gamble of self-determination. The Nordic Union is hung by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191931.A;We shall wait for the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.T;The National Pledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.D;Thanks to the acclaimed diplomatic skills of Duke Erik Mannerheim, the moderate Kelavalist deputies have found a reasonable agreement with the Fennoscandian Party. The new constitution includes many of the draft articles proposed by Copenhagen and some important additions put forward by the nationalists. The newborn Kingdom of Finland will be a constituent country of the Scandinavian Empire and just like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it will formally retain its national assembly (the Eduskunta) while delegating most of the legislative power to the Empire's Landsting in the capitol. After the solemn National Pledge to the Monarch in the Åbo Cathedral, Count Jakob Stiernhielm delivered a speech asking for the extension of full citizenship rights and protection to the Karelian brethren living across the border, where Slavic expansionism threatens their very existence. By unifying Karelia, Copenhagen may finally prove their good faith and curb Finnish nationalism once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191932.A;Itään!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.D;Despite the best efforts of the deputies loyal to the Empire, a new constitution has been drafted by the Kalevalists with the support of some Fennoscandian defectors. A bold harangue by deputy Charles-Joseph de Frise against the draft articles proposed by the Landsting turned the tide of the National Diet in favour of the nationalists, facilitating the following crucial Kelavalist victories. The new National Assembly (the Eduskunta) and Senate will de facto be completely free from Copenhagen's interference and even if the Scandinavian Monarch will still rule over the newborn Kingdom of Finland, the Governor-General will be merely ceremonial figure. In the mainland, disappointment is widespread among the entire population and the general opinion is that the government has officially abandoned the historical ambition of uniting the Baltic under the Scandinavian banner. As Finland secedes without firing a shot, many are becoming critical of the old and weary Kalmar Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191933.A;Is the end of the Scandinavian Empire drawing nearer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.T;The Diet is dissolved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.D;An attempted arson of the building where the National Diet meets has forced the Prime Minister to halt the assembly indefinitely. In the days preceding the attack, the tense relationship between Fennoscandians and Kalevalists had reached a breaking point, forcing the Diet's president to close the session in multiple occasions due to fights between deputies. A Finnish-language radical newspaper (Aamurusko) claims that the arsonist attack has been orchestrated by the Scandinavian government to impede the rejection of Copenhagen's draft articles in the forthcoming session of the Diet and reinstate the status quo by dissolving the assembly. Despite the lack of evidence, many former Finnic deputies have publicly repudiated the Åbo parliament and have started to organize an autonomous Parliament in Borgå. Unrest is quickly growing in the Finnish countryside and some cities like Tavastehus are already in open rebellion. War seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191934.A;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.T;The Pink Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.D;To contain the escalating violence spreading throughout Finland after the attempted arsonist attack at the National Diet, a large group of former deputies and intellectuals have gathered in Tammersfors to complete as fast as possible the drafting of Finland's constitution. The resulting compromise between the Fennoscandians and moderate Kelavalists has been printed on pink-coloured paper and has started to spread throughout the country, gaining mixed reactions. The proposed arrangement will give Finland a great deal of autonomy, nonetheless substantial control over the Parliament and the Senate will be in the hands of the Governor-General and Copenhagen's Landsting. By recognizing the Pink Declaration, most of the Finnic political and cultural elite will reconcile with Scandinavia, but the anger caused by the Åbo Incident will continue to spread albeit at a weaker pace. War has been avoided at a great cost, but it seems like the ghost of violence will not leave Finland for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191935.A;Troubled times lay ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.T;The Eduskunta in Borgå;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.D;Fostered by the Sampo Society and the nationalist gazette Aamurusko, the leading figures of Finland's political and cultural panorama have gathered in the city of Borgå to draft a constitution for the Kingdom of Finland in complete autonomy from the Landsting and the Crown. As the city celebrates the gathering of deputies from all over the country, a growing number of formerly moderate political figures have openly challenged the dogma of a real union with the Empire of the Scandinavia, petitioning for the creation of a Kingdom of Finland with a king other than that of Copenhagen. All orders to halt this insubordination have gone unheeded and following cascading mutinies most of the Imperial Army warehouses have been looted, limiting Scandinavia's effective rule over the region to some major coastal forts like Sveaborg in the Helsingfors bay. The creation of "National Defence Battalions" demonstrates the intentions of the Finnish deputies: only brute force can end this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191936.A;Finland will know the Mainland's wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.T;The Finnish Declaration of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.D;The birth of Kingdom of Finland has been proclaimed from the balcony of the new Senate building in Helsingfors in front of a packed Central Square. The provisional legislative assembly, the Eduskunta, has nominated a plenipotentiary cabinet, the Senate, which will also have the role of a regency council. Independentist zeal spreads throughout the newborn nation and volunteers flock to the recruitment office for the National Defense Batallions. Copenhagen's control over the region has been reduced to a mere formality and a large influx of Scandinavian-speaking refugees has reached the shores of Sweden, fleeing the incoming persecutions of the nationalist government. The imperial cabinet has tried for the last time to reach a peaceful compromise with the Finnish Senate, but a vote of the Eduskunta against the recognition of the Scandinavian Monarch as the head of state has abruptly ended all negotiations. The Finland Uprising has been set in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191937.A;Österland will pay for this treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.T;The King of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.D;Finland has broken the chains of oppression and now needs a King to rally behind. Most of the Scandinavian-speaking deputies of the Eduskunta support the crowning of Count Jakob Stiernhielm, a descendent of an illegitimate son of King Alexander IV. This conciliatory figure will mend the rift between our Scandinavian and Finnish citizens, but Jakob's conservative nature will most likely letdown and alienate the zealous nationalists that are fueling Finland's morale and war effort. To gain foreign help, many have suggested petitioning Prague for a noble to crown in exchange of mutual support against Scandinavia, but the most popular foreign candidate is the Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise, the self-exiled liberal son of Queen Anne of Burgundy who has become a member of the new Senate. He's the nationalists' choice, but will the Burgundians accept the crowning of this rogue family member and the final conclusion of their long worn off alliance with Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.A;Will Anvers recognize Charles Joseph?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.B;Send a messenger to Prague!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.C;Count Jakob Stiernhielm becomes King Jaakko I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.T;A crown from the gutter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.D;Finland has declared independence from Scandinavia and the provisional Regency Council has decided to ask us for a suitable monarch in exchange of a military alliance and substantial economic concessions. This is the perfect occasion to further weaken Scandinavia's grip of the Baltic Sea. Bedrich z Valdstejna, the most prominent member of one the most influential families of the nation, has proven his political skills as governor of Moravia and his family's close links with Bohemian royalty certainly give him the blue blood necessary to bear the crown. Shall the country prepare for yet another war in the North?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.A;We will stand with the Finns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.B;The proposal is rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.T;A King from Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.D;Frederick von Waldstein has landed in Helsinki in great secret to ensure his safe voyage. After a unanimous approval by the Eduskunta, King Fredrik I has been crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral and has confirmed the special powers delegated to the Senate in the previous days. No one dares to interrupt the celebrations, but many in private whisper that the foreign king is more suitable for palace intrigues than for motivating soldiers before a desperate war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191940.A;We'll just have to make do for this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.T;The unexpected king;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.D;Prague has completely ignored the Senate's request for military support in exchange for political and economical influence over Finland. The secret negotiations have been rapidly covered up, but the Eduskunta awaits a new head of state before Scandinavia recovers from the shock of the secession and strikes down hard over the country. Count Jakob Stiernhielm has refused to accept the crown after he had learned of the attempt to contact the Bohemians, whom he had fought against in the past. The Prince of Friesland has disappeared from Helsinki and many suspect that he would not accept the "Second-Hand" crown, angering his nationalist political base. During the last extraordinary session of the Senate, however, the choice fell on the only political figure in the Eduskunta with unanimous respect and admiration from both the conservatives and the radical nationalists: Duke Erik Mannerheim. Despite his lack of dynastic ties with royal families, the love of his people will ennoble him enough to become a rightful king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191941.A;Long live King Erkki I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.T;The Prince of Friesland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.D;Charles-Joseph de Frise, the second son of Queen Anne, has been proposed as the monarch of the newly independent Kingdom of Finland. Charles Joseph has been a frequent embarrassment for the Burgundian royal family due to his unorthodox political ideas, but his voluntary self-exile to the far North had appeased the court of Anvers. Officially recognizing his investiture will give us substantial political and economical benefits in the new realm, but this alliance with the Finns would force us to leave behind our increasingly problematic political alignment with Copenhagen. Disavowing Charles Joseph comes at no cost beyond the potential risk of a regency if we have not yet settled the matter of succession, but the potential gains deriving from a change of policy towards Scandinavia are conceivably superior to those coming from renewing our weary alliance with the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.A;Let us help our new Finnish friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.B;He has nothing to do with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.T;The King of all Finns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.D;The Prince of Friesland has been enthusiastically acclaimed as the new monarch by the Eduskunta and the Senate. Charles-Joseph de Frise has decided to relinquish his Burgundian name and title, becoming Kaarle I of Jülich-Kleve-Suomi, King of all Finns. This energetic and charismatic figure enjoys the support of most of the common people and radical nationalists, but many conservative and moderate figures do not hide their fears of his authoritarian tendencies. Time will tell if King Kaarle will respect the directions of his former peers in the Senate and the legislative assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191943.A;God save our glorious King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.T;Citizen and Deputy Charles Joseph;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.D;When informed of the Senate's decision to crown Charles-Joseph de Frise as King of Finland , Anvers replied by disavowing him and condemning the Finnish uprising. While many support the coronation of the "Citizen-King" regardless of Burgundy's hostility, a group of radical nationalists have suggested to remove all traces of the Scandinavian monarchic mentality and name Charles Joseph "President for life of Finland". However, many adversaries of the ambitious Prince of Friesland, including moderates and former loyalists, have voiced their opposition to these eccentric and blatantly autocratic denominations, proposing instead the creation of a republican parliamentary regime, whose head of state will be decided every six years by the national assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.A;Long live King Kaarle I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.B;Finland shall be a free, united and democratic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.C;All hail our perpetual President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.T;The Finnish Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.D;After centuries of Scandinavian domination, Finland has declared its independence and is now fighting to repel its former oppressors. Ever since their conversion to Christianity, Finnish and Karelians have lived under the influence of either Novgorod or Stockholm and later Copenhagen, fighting against each other to conquer every possible inch of the "Eastern Frontier" for their overlords. The publishing in 1835 of the Kalevala, an epic poem based on Finnic oral folklore, triggered the Finnish National Awakening, rallying intellectuals, artists and, later, politicians from both sides of the Scandinavian-Novgorodian border under the common goal of uniting the Finnic people and protecting it from assimilation either from the West or the East. The members of this movement initially hoped to achieve their goals by peacefully petitioning Copenhagen to recognize their rights to citizenship and national unity within the Scandinavian realm, but the indifference and the missteps of the central government caused the radicalization of Finnish nationalism, leading to the current violent secession. Will the Empire of the North live through this new challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191945.A;We shall strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.T;The War in Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.D;With the start of the Finnish Rebellion, Scandinavia has been too busy organizing the reconquest of its former Baltic dominion to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. The Veche is now free to reclaim its former political authority by revoking the illegal privileges of Scandinavian bourgeoisies. The election of the Posadnik will no longer be determined by the whims of Copenhagen. We are finally free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191946.A;Wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.T;The Treaty of Uppsala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.D;A peace treaty between Scandinavia and Finland has been signed in the ancient capitol of the Swedish Kingdom, of which the newborn nation will no longer be part. The unforeseen defeat has been a tremendous blow for the Empire of the North, whose hegemony in the Baltic Sea is now a thing of the past. After centuries of relative internal peace, regional separatist movements have started to reclaim autonomy from weak Copenhagen for the constituent kingdoms of the realm, especially Sweden whose territory has been halved. To survive this dire moment, Scandinavia has to prove once more its might and its importance among the European empires, and when this time comes the East will face our vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191947.A;A minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.T;The Last Northern Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.D;As soon as the fighting reached the outskirts of Helsingfors, the provisional government of Finland realized that the war was lost and that the exhausted National Defense Batallions could not withstand the assault of the Scandinavian army. Most of the members of the Eduskunta have either surrendered to the imperial forces or have fled towards Russia or Germany, where the enemies of the Empire have promised to support the future struggles for independence of the Finnic people. The resurgence of Finnic nationalism will probably be slow to arrive as war has ravaged both the countryside and the urban centres, leaving behind a war torn and disfigured country. Österland will be reorganized in ten military governances and the estates expropriated from the supporters of the revolutionary regime will be gifted to loyal Scandinavian-speaking subjects of the Empire. The effects of the Finnish National Awakening will be reversed with a process of pervasive Scandinavization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN34.T;The Pskov Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN34.D;Bourgeoises, merchants and nobles from both the city and the countryside are reunited every three years in the Pskovian Veche to appoint a new Posadnik, who has always been a Scandinavian Noble since the rebirth of the Republic. Copenhagen enforces its will either through direct interference in the election process or thanks to its fifth column: the Finnish boyars, who are disproportionately numerous in the Veche thanks to Byzantine bureaucracy and special constitutional clauses. An angry mob has killed the newly re-appointed Posadnik, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, by setting fire to the wooden stage where he was delivering his inaugural speech. Some members of the Veche have died and peasants are besieging the City Hall, but an extraordinary session has been summoned nonetheless to nominate a new Posadnik. Copenhagen is too distant to intervene quickly and Finnish boyars are in disarray. For the first time since "independence", Pskov will decide its own ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN35.D;The Pskovians have rescinded with violent means the privileges of Finnish boyars and in a surprising turn of events the Veche has voted to recognize as sovereign the Prince of Novgorod, rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Uniting the Northern Russians will surely anger Copenhagen, but most of the members of the Novgorodian Veche have already proclaimed their support for this development, regardless of the unavoidable retaliation and the end of Scandinavia's protection against Muscovite expansionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN36.T;Pskov Rejoins Novogrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.D;After the Pskovian peasants killed Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, the Scandinavian-appointed Posadnik of the Republic, a group of Russian boyars took control of the city's Veche and swore fealty to the Prince of Novgorod. Despite the extensive Scandinavian interests in the republic, Pskov is intent on rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Given how the unrest in Finland and the ever-present threat of Bohemia have already stretched our forces thin, it might be wiser to attempt to come to a compromise with the Novgorodians, partitioning the lands of Pskov between each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.A;Offer them the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.B;Never! We will teach these upstarts not to defy Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.T;The Partition of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.D;The Scandinavian reaction to what was effectively a pro-Novgorodian coup has been much milder than anticipated. Copenhagen has offered us a deal in which they agree to recognize our annexation of Pskov as legitimate in exchange for control over Ingria. While a relatively favorable deal, with the bulk of Pskov remaining in our hands, it still fails to resolve the question of our access to the Baltic. There are those in the Veche who loudly proclaim this offer a sign of Scandinavian weakness, and that we should demand the retention of Ingria, even in the event of war. Still others hold that we ought to be satisfied with our laurels, cautioning that Scandinavian protection is the only thing shielding us from aggression by our southern neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.A;Copenhagen shall have Ingria, lest we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN38.D;The Novgorodians have rejected our generous offer to partition the former Republic of Pskov. Already, Novgorodian armies have begun to mobilize and march towards Finland and our Livonian holdings. For the audacity to reject our treaty the Novgorodians will know the full wrath of Scandinavia as we lay waste to their precious republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191953.A;Spare the rod, spoil the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.T;The Posadnik of the Republic of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.D;The Scandinavian-appointed governor of Pskov, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, has been killed by a riot soon after his re-election. The sudden loss of foreign influence over the Pskovian Veche allowed the Russian boyars to independently choose the city's Posadnik, opting for a compromise figure: Adam Grundel-Helmfelt, the Duke of Narva. Adam is a Stockholm-born entrepreneur and Ingria's richest landowner, who has gained the admiration of Russian boyars with calls for fair representation and administrative reform. After his proclamation as Posadnik, Adam "Nerevsky" (from Narva, a sobriquet on "Nevskij" coined by Finnish colonists) has promulgated a new constitution, abolishing most political privileges of the Finnic minority. De facto this doesn't change much in our protectorate, as almost all the political power is in his hands, but tolerating Pskov's self-rule and pro-Slavic legislation may slowly slip the Republic away from our control. How shall we react? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.A;We shall accept the status quo ... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.B;Perhaps we need to make it clear to this upstart who rules in Pskov?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.D;The whole of Ingria has finally come under direct Scandinavian rule. An autonomous dependency has been set up to administer the territory with the eventual goal of integrating the province directly into the Scandinavian state. After a brief spat with the Novgorodians, mare nostrum Balticum has been reaffirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191955.A;No longer shall Finland and Livonia be threatened from the east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.D;After reaching an agreement with the Scandinavians, Pskov has been allowed to rejoin the Novgorodian Confederation as a constituent republic. While the Scandinavians still hold hostage our access to the Baltic, today is nonetheless a victory for Novgorod the Great. Cries of jubilation can be heard all throughout the republic as our brothers have been reunited with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191956.A;Perhaps one day we may also regain the Baltic coastline ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.T;The expulsion of the Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.D;Scandinavia has extended citizenship rights and protection to all Finnic people, regardless of the country of origin, leading to the overnight annexation of our Karelian territories and the expulsion of our Pomor compatriots who had settled in the region. This blatant violation of the long-standing border treaty with the Empire of the North has caused great outrage in the Novgorodian Veche and most of the city's notables are petitioning for vengeance against foreign invaders and the expulsion of Finnic and Scandinavian nationals from the Republic. Bowing to Copenhagen's will means tainting the secular pride of Novgorodian independence, but denouncing the aggression will remove the political and military protection that lets this pride live on despite threats from the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.A;It's a terrible price to pay if we want to safeguard our Republic's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.B;We shall redraw the western border with our swords and their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.T;The Pskov Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.D;Pan-Russianism has experienced a resurgence in the Republic of Pskov in the wake of the creation of a Russian nation-state. The Russian-majority population of the Republic widely supports the prospect of annexation by Russia but the Finnish boyars who dominate the government enjoy the privileges independence affords them. Recently, however, we have been approached by a group of pro-Russian patriots that promises to seize control of the Veche and proclaim annexation to Russia. They claim that the Pskovian army, composed primarily of Russians, considers Russian annexation favorable -- or at the very least not unfavorable -- and that they would not act to prevent the uprising. Such a move would certainly be more diplomatically palatable than a military invasion of the Republic, though we must still be wary of the Scandinavian response to our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.A;Pskov must join the Russian fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.D;Their work was swift. In the dead of the long Russian night, pan-Russian insurgents had stormed the Veche and seized control over the Republic. The Pskovian army was powerless to stop them, with Russian officers unwilling to fire upon their fellow countrymen and many even rallying to the cause of the rebels. Already, these insurgents have proclaimed the Republic annexed to Russia, and the Russian army has swooped in to take over control from these rebels -- not, however, before the Scandinavian army could seize the fortress at Nyenschanz. The situation remains tense, but one thing remains certain: the Republic of Pskov is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.A;A sad day for the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.T;The Stain on Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more. At one time, the Scandinavians had set up a military administration in its place, but now what was once a Scandinavian governorate has become an independent nation. The basic structure administering the territory has not changed, however, with the predominantly Finnish-Scandinavian ruling class marginalizing the Russian-majority population of the territory. This situation is a stain on the honor of the Russian nation, and nationalists both at home and abroad have called for our government to intervene on the behalf of our oppressed countrymen. Our agents have been covertly organizing the Russian population of Ingria with the promise of Russian support for their revolt, and now the time has come to make good on this pledge. We must wipe this stain off of the maps of Europe and complete the unification of the Russian nation!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.A;We must drive out these Scandinavian freebooters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.T;The Collapse of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.D;Our fledgling administration was always one built on an unstable foundation. Originating as a march of Scandinavia, our nation since its inception has been ruled by force of arms, and not with the consent of the masses. Since our independence from Scandinavia, our ability to provide for our armies has suffered greatly, and with nationalist tensions mounting with the recent unification of Russia it should come as no surprise that our meagre forces have been quickly overrun by a country-wide nationalist revolt. The whole of Ingermanland has been seized by these rebels and transferred to Russian control, barring the fortress at Nyenschanz, which has been hastily occupied by our evacuating forces. What still exists of our army has defected back to our former Scandinavian overlords, ensuring that in both fact and name Ingermanland no longer exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.A;It was only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.T;The Problem of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying us access to the Baltic. Chafing under Scandinavian suzerainty, and inspired by our recent national unification, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of our new nation. While the revolt was ultimately put down via Scandinavian intervention, the magnitude of the revolt has turned the opinions of the great powers of Europe largely against Scandinavian rule. With Russia now united under our rule, and Scandinavia diplomatically isolated on this issue, we have seen fit to press the claims of these nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.A;Pskov will be liberated from the Scandinavian tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.T;The Treaty of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying the Russians access to the Baltic. Chafing under our suzerainty, and inspired by the recent unification of the Russian princes, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of the newly-formed Russian nation. While we succeeded in restoring power to the surviving members of the Veche, the Russians have decided to press the claims of these rebels, and after witnessing the scope of the uprising the rest of the great powers of Europe generally agree that we should make some concessions to the Russians living in the territory.\n \n Having succeeded in isolating us, our only diplomatic recourse now is to reach a settlement favorable to the Russians that at least ensures our security in Finland and Livonia. Should the Russians reject our offer there can be no doubt that they will take this opportunity to seize Pskov for themselves. There are some who believe that war may be a good thing, however. If we were to triumph over the Russians on the field of battle, they would be forced to recognize our control over Pskov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.A;The Russians may have Pskov, but we will retain Nyenschanz as a matter of national security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.B;Never! The Gate of Russia is ours alone to open and close at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.T;An Offer from Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.D;Having been forced to the negotiating table, Copenhagen has approached us with a highly favorable treaty in which the majority of Pskov will be immediately annexed to us. Scandinavia will maintain control only over their fortress at Nyenschanz and only for a period of 15 years as they prepare adequate defenses elsewhere in Finland, after which point they promise to hand the territory over to us. Of course, the Scandinavians may always renege on that promise, but perhaps that is a risk worth taking. If our interests in the north are not that great, a friendly neighbor in Scandinavia will certainly prove a valuable asset as we direct our attention in other directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.A;This is everything we could have hoped for! We will accept their treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.B;We cannot tolerate Scandinavian control over the mouth of the Neva for even one more minute! Nyenschanz shall be ours immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.D;Once again the great powers of Europe have convened to decide the fate of an independent nation and once again that nation was not party to their negotiations. While the Scandinavians supported us in putting down that nationalist revolt they have now backstabbed us at the negotiation table. Russia and Scandinavia have mutually agreed to partition our nation, with the Republic of Pskov henceforth being no more in the eyes of the world. The Pskovian Veche has with great sorrow assembled for one last time to pass a measure confirming the dissolution of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.A;Perhaps someday an international organization may exist to protest these infringements on national sovereignty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.D;The Scandinavians thought that they could placate us with empty promises and half-hearted efforts at reconciliation. But no! We reject any offer from Copenhagen short of the complete unification of the Russian nation, and to that end we have declared a state of war with Scandinavia. Pskov has declared itself an indivisible part of the Russian nation and we intend on making good on that fact. Scandinavia shall not deny us our heritage, and they shall not throttle our access to the Baltic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.A;We shall teach them the might of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.T;Humiliation from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.D;Our forces have been soundly defeated by the armies of Russia! As part of the peace agreement, we have been forced to recognize as valid the declaration from those upstart nationalists. The whole of Pskov shall be immediately annexed to Russia without partition. In return, the Russians have withdrawn their occupation forces from Finland and Livonia, restoring our control over the regions. With the loss of Ingria, our holdings in Finland and Livonia are no longer connected by land, and the loss of the fortress at Nyenschanz has left both Finland and Livonia undefended from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.A;Well, at least we still have Finland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.D;The peasant hordes of Russia proved to be no match for the professional armies of Scandinavia! The Russian bear lies before us, defeated and discredited, leaving us free to act as we please with respect to Ingria. Having recognized how the nominally independent Republic of Pskov failed to defend our interests against the mounting nationalist pressures of the population, we have seen fit to dissolve the republic and replace it with a military commission to govern the region directly under the control of Copenhagen. The Ingermanland March, as it is known, will pave the way for Scandinavian and Finnish settlement in the region, ensuring the future loyalty of the territory and the smooth transition to eventual Scandinavian integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.A;Pskov has served its purpose. Now Copenhagen has taken control of the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more, and in its place we have set up a military administration over its former territories. The measures that the Ingermanland March has taken to ensure the loyalty of the territories have been admittedly harsh, with the forcible relocation of large parts of the Russian population being commonplace, amongst other practices. Recent publications of accounts of our rule, while clearly heavily embellished, have nonetheless caused outrage throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, creating a crisis over the region. How this ultimately plays out remains to be seen, but for now we have taken direct control over the affected regions from the Ingermanland March as a temporary measure in order to quell the immediate concerns over our march’s governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.A;Oops ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.D;Accounts of Scandinavian atrocities in Ingria have circulated for a while now, but for the first time we now have definitive proof of their conduct in the territory. Papers containing orders to seize the lands of Russian landowners, and forged documents detailing the transfer of property from said landowners to Scandinavian and Finnish settlers have been intercepted. Mass graves of Russian peasants have been uncovered and photographed, as have the deserted villages from which they originated. Newspapers all across Europe are now publishing accounts of these atrocities, inflaming public opinion against the Scandinavian occupation. At this point, we could either send an ultimatum to the Scandinavians, demanding reparations for their violence and the transfer of those lands inhabited by a Russian majority, or we could forgo asking entirely and simply seize the entirety of the Ingermanland March. Either way, our cause is just, and the great powers of Europe are unlikely to intervene against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.A;These barbarians are not fit to govern Russians! Demand the land and reparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.B;We must seize the whole of Ingria and punish them for these deplorable acts of violence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.T;The Russian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.D;The Russians have sent us an ultimatum. In it, they demand that we cede to them those territories in Ingria inhabited by a Russian-majority population. They have also demanded financial reparations on behalf of the victims, both real and imagined, of our rule over the region. Do we give in to their demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.A;The Russians have isolated us. We have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.B;A hundred thousand men will lie dead before we cede an inch of soil to the Russians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.T;A Baltic Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.D;While we do not necessarily lack a Baltic coastline, that short stretch we do control is unsuitable for the construction of any sort of harbor. As a result, most of our northern trade continues to flow to the rest of Europe via the Neva, allowing the Scandinavians to maintain a stranglehold on our trade with their control of Nyenschanz. With the rise of a unified Russian economy and the growing economic prosperity it has brought us, the situation has reached a point where it has become necessary to gain free access to the markets of Europe, whether that be by direct control over the Neva estuary or some other agreement with the Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.A;Perhaps the Scandinavians can accommodate us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.T;The Conference of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.D;While the Conference of Helsinki quickly concluded that the Scandinavian straits should be free and open to international traffic, the original issue that prompted negotiations in the first place -- that of Scandinavian Ingria -- remained unresolved. The proposal that seemed to have the most traction was to partition the Ingermanland March, with Scandinavia retaining the fortress at Nyenschanz in order to defend Finland while Russia gains a length of coastline suitable for the construction of a new port. Russia would also be exempt from paying the large indemnity we receive for abolishing the toll. Another proposal, albeit less popular, was to cede the entirety of Ingria to the Russians in exchange for their recognition of our sovereignty over Karelia. Still others are frustrated with these negotiations in the first place, having become upset that the issue has resulted in the loss of the Sound Toll, and maintain that we ought at least retain the whole of Ingria for having lost this major source of state revenue. (ONLY REJECTION IS POSSIBLE IN CURRENT BUILD);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.A;We have already lost our right to the Sound Toll. Ingria is where we draw the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.D;Negotiations have broken down between us and the Scandinavians. They insist on maintaining their stranglehold on our access to the Baltic, which to us is unacceptable. We will make Scandinavia pay for their crimes against the Russian nation as we seize the whole of Ingria from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.A;They shall soon know to fear the Russian bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.T;The Loss of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.D;Vae Victis! Woe to the defeated! With our forces crushed by the armies of Russia, we are forced to recognize the Russian annexation of Ingria and the loss of our claims to the territory. In return, the Russians have agreed to withdraw from Finland and Livonia, though who knows how long until the Russians come back to seize those as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.A;We have been humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.T;The Humiliation of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.D;Victory! Our armies stand victorious over the battered Russian bear! As part of the treaty creating peace between our two nations, the Russians have been forced to pay a large indemnity for damages caused by their armies to the property of Scandinavian citizens. The Russians have also been forced to recognize our control over Ingria “in perpetuity.” How long “perpetuity” is in actuality remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the humiliation Russia has experienced at our hands will forbid them from Ingria for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI2.T;The Imperial Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI2.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Joseph. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, the emperor and his family ended in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Joseph crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI3.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Ferdinando. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, Ferdinando made a great speech at the ruins of the Coliseum about his late father who paved the way for the success of the crown of Aragon. The emperor and his family ended their tour of the city in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Ferdinando crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony.

ARI4.T;Troubles in the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.D;None thought that proclaiming the Empire would solve all problems in the Western Mediterranean but the young empire faces several oppositions that could spell the end of the Serna dream. First the Pope, angered by the Imperial coronation and the reduction of his temporal powers, is proving to be hard to manage, especially as the devout hordes of catholics in the South and the rest of the Empire look up to him. The northern princes of Italy have not stayed idle either, with Marianists gathering support against what they consider our illegitimate rule. And Catalonia, once the center of the Crown, has seen various liberal and nationalist agitators advocating for an independent and republican Catalonia. We must be careful not to upset these groups if we don't want to see the end of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.A;We will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC1.T;The Rzeczpospolita;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLC1.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC2.T;The death of Maximilian III;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.D;The king of the Commonwealth has died in Warsaw after 20 years of rule mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his Kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maximilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto (the right for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly) and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. Despite his political weakness he leaves a good memory to the citizens of Warsaw that have gathered in huge crowds for his funeral. Now the prepatory Sejm will convene to select candidates to his succession, with his son Stanislaw in good place to succeed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.A;Farewell Maksymilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.T;The Sejm in deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.D;The Sejm has been convened for already several months and has not been able to advance a definitive list of candidates to the succession of Maximilian III. The main problem resides in the candidacy of his son Stanislaw, a well-known Liberal and independent noble which is seen as a threat by both the foreign powers of Scandinavia and Bohemia but also by the most powerful nobles of the country who fear he will try to rescind their privileges. The liberation of his serfs in his own domain in 1833 was already widely criticized by the Magnateria while giving Stanislaw widespread popularity outside of the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.A;Will they be able to elect someone already ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.T;The Black procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.D;Following the deadlock of the prepatory Sejm, several prominent members of the Polish bourgeoisie (including delegates from Kiev, Danzig or Vilnius) gathered in the streets of the capital to hasten the process and demanding more rights for the people no belonging to the nobility. The burghers had been protesting the difference of treatment for years but it was the first time such an event was organized. While the mayor of Warsaw, Michael Konopka, was officially the main organizer of the march, it is widely understood that this was coordinated by Stanislaw Habsburg to strengthen his partisans in the Sejm. While completely pacific, going against Stanislaw could prove to provoke troubles with the Liberal movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC5.T;Choosing the candidates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC5.D;Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts and of the principality of Smolensk the Sejm continued to be deadlocked. Eventually the Sejm would have to choose the candidates for the election. After weeks of debates 4 candidates demarked themselves : Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobility. Johannes von Wettin cousin of the duke of Prussia supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw Habsburg is put into the list or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC8.D;Democratic liberals in $COUNTRY$ have been ignored for a long time, the nobles ruling the country being content with allowing expression of discontent but doing nothing about it. The government of Warsaw has discovered a liberal plot to kill the current King and replace him with the shunned candidate Stanislaw Habsburg who would promulgate several reforms and abolish the Golden liberties. This plot was denounced by one of his members and the Army has raided the houses of the main leaders while an attempt of seditious members of the people to rise against us was squashed in blood. Most of the leaders were convicted of treason and executed while Stanislaw, who was apparently not aware of the conspiracy, has fled the country to avoid such a fate. The Rzeczpospolita endures, and the dominance of the Nobles as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC9.D;Following his election, Stanislaw I tried several times to assemble a confederated Sejm, a type of assembly where the liberum veto could not be used as to pass several laws and appease the liberals of the various towns. Despite all his efforts, the opposition of the nobility led to no consensus and he was forced to call a regular Sejm that was blocked by several noblemen who used their golden liberties to stop all attempts at reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Order was only restored after the intervention of the Royal guards, with the King himself protecting his opponent Jozef Potocki who found shelter in the Royal Palace after nearly being killed by the crowd. This event has reinforced the will of the reformers who are now persuaded that only them stand between chaos and the preservation of order while magnates are scared and hire more members for their guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC21.D;The Constitutionalists have been defeated by the combined forces of the Magnates and foreign powers who were not content with a strong Commonwealth thriving and its people freed! The Rzeczpospolita has been torn apart, the king Stanislaw Habsburg exiled along with other great Liberal figures. Now the Jagiellons of Prague have annexed western Poland while putting a cadet of their family on the throne of 'Poland', the first in 300 years. Little Poland has been reorganized as the duchy of Galicia with its capital in Krakow, while the Baltic coast has also been taken from Poland with Lithuania now a Scandinavian puppet. The only winners of this terrible treaty are the Ruthenians who have been given most of their claims in exchange for staying out of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

################## EVENTS START HERE #####################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC1.T;An Emperor in Name Alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC1.D;In 1790, the liberal Emperor Ludwig VII was assassinated by a Bohemian officer and the conservative Wenceslaus V undid his reforms. In response, liberal revolutionaries swore an oath in Zeil-Street, Frankfurt, to create a new Imperial Republic and shatter the First and Second Estates (the clergy and nobility). Lieutenant-Colonel Marinus Dahlke led the defection of much of the Reichsarmee to the Republic, won several important battles, and then proclaimed himself Consul of the Republic. His attempts to destroy European monarchism eventually led to his overthrow, but Wenceslaus V then tried to centralize the Empire, setting off a new series of conflicts. This Great German War, and the Treaty of Paris that ended it in 1820, has crippled the Empire. Wenceslaus V had almost made us a true nation-state, but the Imperial Estates once again rule on their own. Sigismund was a child during his reign, and with the end of the regency, he now stands where Charles IV of Luxembourg stood in 1300 : having to rebuild the Empire almost from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, #note: background of the empire and the GGW: mention dahlke and the zeil street oath, ect, and how the continent-wide war led to the HRE effectively not existing on anything but paper: how fragile, how princes are effectively ruling on their own again after it seemed like the empire finally found unity under Wenceslaus. Mention how Sigismund was like 10 (check age) when he was on the throne, and after  the regency, he literally has to build an empire up from scratch
HUNC1.A;Long live Sigismund V, Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC2.T;The Saxon Inheritance;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC2.D;After the Great German War and the subsequent peace treaties, the Ernestine duchies signed the Erfurt Agreement of 1823. This prevented further partitioning and laid clear guidelines for the division of land should a ducal line be extinguished. However, all lines survived and the agreement was revised. This new agreement created the 'confederation' of Ducal Saxony. All duchies are sovereign but their laws and taxes are synchronized, a central government was set up to administer the whole region, and a new unitary flag was created for the state. Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to perceived exceptionalism and its special tax rights. Now that its economy has stagnated, it wants to join. With the Ernestine duchies now fully reunited, the dukes intend to reorganize the confederation under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia whose partitioning created the duchies in the first place. However the Emperor may force us to accept his personal “protection” in exchange for approving this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC2.A;Thuringia is united once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC3.T;Imperial Incident One : Renegotiating the Erfurt Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC3.D;After the Great German War and the subsequent peace treaties, the Ernestine duchies signed the Erfurt Agreement of 1823. This prevented further partitioning and laid clear guidelines for the division of land should a ducal line be extinguished, but, all lines survived and the agreement was revised. This new agreement created the 'confederation' of Ducal Saxony. All duchies are sovereign but their laws and taxes are synchronized under a central government with a new unitary flag. Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to its unique laws but its economic stagnation has caused it to seek renegotiation. The dukes intend to reorganize under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia, their titular ancestor, but we may want to force them to accept special Imperial protection to keep them loyal. §RWe must remember that the Treaty of Paris curtailed Imperial authority. From this moment on, whenever we intervene in our Imperial Estates, we will be increasing the risk of a new Great German War.§;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC3.A;We will not interfere. Imperial consolidation is long overdue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC3.B;§RDucal Saxony must replace foreign influences with our protection.§;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC4.T;The Riots in Bremen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC4.D;The Scandinavian garrison of the Free Imperial City of Bremen has long been loathed by Bremeners, ever since the ousting of Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions. Long gone are the days of the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular mayor Hermann von Lettow, who, despite inviting Scandinavian forces to the city, managed to spare Bremen from much of the Great German War and secure its independence during the Paris Peace Congress as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor Walther Raschen inspires no such love from the citizenry, who now see Bremen as an occupied territory. The government’s fear of prosecuting Scandinavian soldiers’ crimes has given rise to independent citizen militias. These militias, demanding the resignation of Raschen and the immediate expulsion of Scandinavian troops, are now rioting the Marktplatz and several small fires have already been ignited by their attacks. Rachen in turn has demanded that the Scandinavians help the city guard restore order…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC4.A;Bremen must not fall into anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC5.T;The Bremen Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC5.D;We occupied the Imperial Free City of Bremen during the Imperial Revolutions at the request of German-Scandinavian aristocrat Hermann von Lettow, ousting Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele. But von Lettow died in office and was replaced by the reactionary Walther Raschen. Repeated accusations have been made that the Bremen courts are afraid to charge our troops (despite the Treaty of Paris which ended the Great German War permitting our garrison to only use force in self-defense). In turn, independent citizen militias have formed. Recently they converged upon the Markplatz, where they first demanded Raschen’s resignation and the expulsion of our troops, then began to riot, threatening to set the city ablaze. Our soldiers, at Raschen’s request, violently put down the mob. Now Copenhagen papers speak of the “Bremen Massacre,” allowing the liberals to paint the Unionsters as barbarians. The Elbian Germans across the realm are now protesting, denouncing us as occupiers, and martial law has been declared in Bremen, Holstein, and Pomerania.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
HUNC5.A;And what was the alternative? Let Raschen die and the city burn?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC6.T;The Bremen Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC6.D;Scandinavia has occupied the Free Imperial City of Bremen ever since they ousted Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions. This was at the request of his replacement, the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular Hermann von Lettow, who managed to spare Bremen from much of the Great German War and secure its independence during the Paris Peace Congress as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor was the reactionary Walther Raschen. Rumors that the Bremener courts would not prosecute Nordic soldiers gave rise to independent citizen militias. These militias staged a riot in the Marktplatz to demand the resignation of Raschen and the expulsion of Scandinavian troops. Raschen summoned the Scandinavians, and the garrison shot and beat the crowd into submission. Scandinavia has placed their own German territories under martial law. Needless to say, use of force against Imperial citizens by the garrison was forbidden by the Treaty of Paris except in self-defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC6.A;Savagery, thy name is Scandinavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC7.T;The Schwerin Clash;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC7.D;Ever since the 17th century, the United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland has held the duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Pomerania, despite both officially lying within the Empire. Over the years, Scandinavia’s administration has led to the term “Pomerania” starting to encompass the whole territory. However, the ancient House of Mecklenburg still survives in the cadet branch of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who still cling to their last county with Imperial protection. Now the Bremen Massacre and the resulting imposition of martial law by Scandinavia has sparked clashes throughout Mecklenburg. The violence has even spread to the Schwerin border, with Germans on both sides demanding the reunification of the Duchy and the removal of all Scandinavian influence from northern Germany. Scandinavia’s grip on the Ostsee coast appears weaker than ever before, something that we should look to exploit in our quest to reunify the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, ##basically the germans of schwerin demonstrate as a reaction to the martial law: clashes with the garrison of schwerin, demands to be reunited with mecklenburg and removal of Scandinavian domination over Northern Germany. It doesn’t necessarily turn to violence but it is mostly a signal to Bohemia that there’s deeply seeded unrest along the Northern coast, that they ought to exploit.
HUNC7.A;Contact the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Let’s make a deal…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC8.T;The State of the Lands of the Szent Korona (Holy Crown);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC8.D;The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were a battleground between the Jagiellons and the Turks for centuries. Transylvanian Prince Janos II Kemény, descended from the great Hunyadis, was briefly the king of Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia in the seventeenth century, but was defeated by simultaneous attacks from the Empire, Poland, and the Turks. The Great Turkish War of the eighteenth century and the Great German War decades later allowed us to eventually oust both powers and win our freedom. Now we find ourselves within an interregnum, with Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania the leading candidate. However he is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant, and unpopular outside of his homeland. Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris forbids any Jagiellon from ruling Hungary, yet they refuse to return the Szent Korona, vital to Magyar kingship. With our borders temporarily secure, the eastern Protestant and western Catholic magnates are bickering over whether to support Krisztofer or search for someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
HUNC8.A;Atoning sorrow hath weighed down sins of past and future days…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC9.T;Tensions in Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC9.D;Some western magnates have begun to begrudgingly accept that Krisztofer’s pedigree and personal charisma make him the best choice for the throne. Others have not. One holdout in particular is Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra, a fiery Catholic zealot of Croatian and Moravian blood whose ancestors fought under the Papal banner in the anti-Hussite crusades. Gábor, denouncing Krisztofer’s lack of the Szent Korona and “failure to reclaim” Turkish-held Temesköz, demands that Emperor Sigismund V be crowned instead! This is despite the Treaty of Paris explicitly forbidding a Jagiellon to rule Hungary, not to mention the fact that we are in no condition to attack the Turks…and yet, Sigismund holds both a claim and the Szent Korona. Hungarian law states that the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary and superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown.” No king is truly legitimate without it - yet enthroning the Emperor would create an international catastrophe and would spark a war beyond reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
HUNC9.A;Krisztofer is the rightful king, even if the Szent Korona is in Prague!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC10.T;The King of the Hungarian Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC10.D;Duke Gabor IV’s scheme to install Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary forced our hand. We could no longer wait for the return of the Szent Korona. The House of Kemény thus convinced a bare minimum quorum of magnates to support Krisztofer’s kingship through bribery and blackmail. To that end, an emergency meeting of the Hungarian Diet was convened in Buda, where, in a solemn ceremony, Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania was acclaimed “King of the Hungarian Nation,” an archaic but technically sufficient title. This is a temporary measure to award him sorely needed legitimacy until the Szent Korona is returned and he can be properly coronated. Unfortunately, this desperate act has allowed the Duke of Nitra to rally Catholic magnates to his cause by denouncing the procedure as a sham and the new King Krisztofer to be illegitimate. All of Upper Hungary is now awash with reaction, especially among the magnates who refused to attend the Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC10.A;Long live the TRUE king!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC11.T;The Nitran Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC11.D;Duke Gabor IV’s insubordination has increased in scope. He is now believed to be recruiting support among the western and northern magnates, as well as the Catholic clergy, to contest King Krisztofer’s legitimacy. While ordinarily we would arrest him for treason against the monarch, our nation is barely keeping together as it is, and attempting to imprison a duke so popular with the Catholic clergy and the nobility could ignite a civil war. Therefore we are doing our best to keep an eye on the Duke. As of late he has been hosting guests from all over the Catholic regions of Hungary - we presume that he is building support to contest the King’s rule. We cannot be certain of how many of his acquaintances have agreed to join his cause, but the possibility of insurrection at least in Upper Hungary in the near future must be considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC11.A;Duke Gabor brings shame to the House of Zápolya!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC12.T;The Looming Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC12.D;The House of Jagiellon claimed the Kingdom of Hungary ever since it slipped from our grasp in the 15th century. We made various attempts to reclaim it, but Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Great German War, forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary. Now it appears that the matter may be reignited. Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra is a fervent Catholic who despises the current King, Krisztofer Kemény (descendant of Janos II Kemény who briefly ruled Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia). Krisztofer is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant from Transylvania, and thus quite controversial. Furthermore, it is we, not Krisztofer, who hold the Holy Crown of Hungary, without which no man can legally rule the kingdom. Krisztofer was forced to take the title of “King of the Hungarian Nation” just to claim any form of legitimacy. It is well-known that the Duke, who is himself part Moravian, admires Sigismund and wishes that he would rule Hungary. Yet such a blatant violation of the Treaty of Paris could ignite an international crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC12.A;Let us hope, then, that they are simply rumors…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC13.T;The Rogue Diet of Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC13.D;Duke Gabor IV has decided to act. It is now clear that he was indeed recruiting conspirators for a plot against the monarchy, a conspiracy which has moved into action in Nitra City. There, Hungarian magnates and bishops from across the Catholic heartland have convened to hold an illegal and unrecognized Diet. At this meeting, the Duke and his conspirators first declared Krisztofer’s acclamation as “King of the Hungarian Nation” to be legally meaningless, and then recognized Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! We were unable to prevent word of this supreme treason from reaching Prague, and are now preparing for the worst. Martial law has been declared across Upper Hungary, and we must prepare for the possibility of civil war or even an invasion by the Holy Roman Empire to place its ruler upon our throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC13.A;JUDAS!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC14.T;A Dangerous Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC14.D;Our suspicions as to the plans of Duke Gabor IV of Nitra have been confirmed. The disgruntled Duke and other aggrieved Hungarian magnates have convened an unauthorized Diet in Nitra City. There the Duke, and the Archbishop of Pozsony, led the conspirators in recognizing Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! They followed this by requesting that the Emperor bring the Szent Korona and the Reichsarmee south into Hungary, where the magnates shall join forces with him and march to battle against Krisztofer. Sigismund had almost ordered the Reichsarmee to be marshalled before Chancellor Karl von Schwartzenberg reminded him that Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris explicitly forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary. This matter has now reached beyond a mere regional dispute, as it is almost certain that agents of the Scandinavian or Burgundian crown within Prague are on their way back to their masters to relate news of this escalating crisis. §RIf they choose to strike preemptively then we could be facing a new Great German War.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC14.A;We will not back down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC15.T;Scandinavia Catches Wind of the Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC15.D;The standoff with the Duke of Nitra and his legion of traitors has only grown more complicated. Word of their appeal to Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V has now reached the ears of Scandinavia, supposedly by way of an intercepted letter from one of the magnates to a relative in the Imperial court. While not quite as obvious a piece of evidence as the actual offer of the crown, we believe that it holds enough information about the Upper Hungarian conspiracy that Scandinavia will be able to piece together the other details. The result is that we may soon see this matter escalate from a regional concern into a continental crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC15.A;Damned treasonous rats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC16.T;Bohemian Perfidy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC16.D;The Treaty of Paris, which ended the devastating Great German War in 1820, forced the Bohemians to surrender their claim to Hungary. But once again, the House of Jagiellon has overstepped its bounds in its hunger for power. News has reached us that the Duke of Nitra and a group of northern Hungarian magnates have acclaimed Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! This is a direct violation of Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris and would result in the Bohemians accumulating an unacceptable level of power, which they would surely use to strip our German-speaking lands from us. Therefore we must bring him to justice! The military has been placed on alert and word has been sent to our allies in Burgundy to prepare for another war on the fields of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC16.A;Together we shall punish the criminal emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC17.T;Scandinavia Warns of a Crisis in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC17.D;Dire news has reached us from Copenhagen : Scandinavia has caught wind of a conspiracy between Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V and a group of Hungarian magnates led by the Duke of Nitra to recognize Sigismund as King of Hungary! This is an explicit breach of Article XVIII which ended the decades-long Great German War in 1820 and forced the Jagiellons to annul their claim to Hungary. If the Emperor assumes control of Hungary then their power in Europe would rival that of the Dual Monarchy and they could even attempt to centralize the Empire, just as the mad Marinus Dahlke or Sigismund’s own father attempted in the past. This cannot be tolerated! The whole Burgundian military is on edge as our ministers come to the ghastly conclusion that we are on the edge of a Second Great German War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC17.A;If it’s a fight that Sigismund wants…! Declare general mobilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC18.T;Our Friends in Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC18.D;Scandinavia has somehow caught wind of Duke Gabor IV’s offer of the Hungarian crown to Emperor Sigismund V and is outraged at our breach of the Treaty of Paris. Their military is already mobilizing in preparation for an invasion to force us to back down and Burgundy, their closest ally, is preparing the same! Our only hope now is to prevail upon our own ally, the Dual Monarchy, to intervene and prevent a continental war. It seems likely that they will insist upon a diplomatic solution, which would prevent Scandinavia and Burgundy from imposing any sort of settlement upon us. All eyes now turn to the Anglois, to prevent Europe from plunging back into carnage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC18.A;May the Bridge over Salzach still stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC19.T;The Hungarian Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC19.D;Burgundian, Scandinavian, be Imperial diplomats have all been meeting with the Foreign Minister regarding a monstrous political snarl. The trouble originated with the conservative Catholic Duke of Nitra, who rallied dissatisfied Hungarian magnates to recognize Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary and encouraged him to depose Hungary’s liberal Protestant king. This is a direct breach of Article XVIII (annulling the Jagiellon claim to Hungary) of the Treaty of Paris which ended the devastating Great German War in 1820. Burgundy and Scandinavia have become apoplectic at the notion of Sigismund breaking the Treaty and seizing Hungary, and are mobilizing for war against the Empire. It now falls to us to use our influence to prevent such a cataclysm. We have notified all three powers that a new congress shall be held in neutral Venice to iron out the matter or else we will intervene in the war. There shall not be a second Great German War on our watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC19.A;Once again, we must be the stewards of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC20.T;Paris Demands Restraint!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC20.D;An urgent missive from the Dual Monarchy has been received regarding the stirrings of war in central Europe. They have, in the most diplomatic terms, strongly urged all parties - especially Burgundy and Scandinavia - to stand down and attempt negotiation before resorting to force. For this purpose they have proposed to hold a new diplomatic Congress in the neutral city of Venice to iron out the matter and give all nations involved a say in the situation’s resolution. This is more of a demand than a request, and rather than enter into open war with multiple European powers, including the Plantagenets, we should take this opportunity to prevent a new Great German War from erupting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC20.A;Very well, if we must…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC21.T;A Delegation from the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC21.D;The serene Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania have always been subject to foreign meddling in internal and external affairs - with the Sejm always viewed as a pawn to the whims of the Bohemians and Scandinavians, leaving no semblance of authority to the monarch whatsoever. The Commonwealth is in a tight leash to the ambitions of either side - be it of territorial, internal, or diplomatic purpose. However, with their interest in keeping the “peace” in Central Europe once more - or so they say, they have reached out to the Burgundian embassy in Warsaw, asking for permission to partake in the upcoming Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC21.A;A useful pawn is still useful, we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC21.B;Hmm…no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC22.T;The Ottoman Delegation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC22.D;The long stagnant yet enduring Sublime State still holds considerable sway in the Mediterranean and the Balkans despite being weakened due to internal dissent and foreign meddling. The crippling losses brought upon by the Holy League in the 17th century were a disgrace to the Ottomans, with many Ottoman irredentists seeing this event as a prelude to the “Tumultuous Age” with the loss of Hungary and their other Balkan holdings. There is no denying that the Ottomans will bring these matters forth as one final attempt to regain their credibility with the Great Powers, but is the Sick Man still decisive enough to hold any sway in the grander scheme of things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC22.A;If this merits peace and stability, then we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC22.B;It’s best we leave the Sick Man of Europe to rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC23.T;The Austrian Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC23.D;Karl von Schwartzenberg, the Austrian Foreign Minister, has come up with proposals to defuse this “terrible” and “dreary” situation on behalf of all Danubians in the Empire. Despite being a complete neophyte in the field of foreign relations and diplomacy, he is mostly known for his rather “trickster-like” attitude in managing day-to-day foreign and state affairs which earned him popularity among affluent Austrians and Danubians alike in the Empire. Giving him this opportunity would surely gain the ire of the Bavarians wary of Austrian attempts to break their Danubian hegemony, but who else do we have to beckon nevertheless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC23.A;Very well, give him the green light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC23.B;We respectfully decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC24.T;Von Schwartzenberg’s Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC24.D;The atmosphere in Munich has taken a turn for the worse with the news of von Schwartzenberg’s arrival, the Austrian Foreign Affairs Minister. With our citizens still on edge with the news of the Saxon Incident, they too hope for a silver lining for the days to come. He has promised his full and unwavering support for defusing tensions in the Empire but our bellicose statesmen recognizes this as a move to further Austrian interests, threatening our Danubian hegemony. Given that our Bohemian partners have given us the opportunity to partake (and outright decline in partaking) in this noble yet insidious endeavor, is this really worth the trouble?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC24.A;If this “proposal” brings stability and peace, then we accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC24.B;Sensible? Opportunistic, more like. Never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC25.T;The Bavarians Decline!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC25.D;An outrage! The Austrian Foreign Affairs Minister has been disgracefully booted out from Bavaria by royal decree due to the intervention of conservative politicians at the behest of the Wittelsbachs. They allege that us Austrians will use this as an opportunity to strengthen their hold on Danubian affairs and put them on “equal” and bellicose footing with Bavarian affairs and ambitions. Whatever their ramblings may be, it seems that they have passed up a one-of-a-kind deal that would bring stability to Imperial affairs once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC25.A;Have they failed to see the light?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC26.T;Von Schwartzenberg’s Blunder;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC26.D;We have received unfortunate news from our diplomatic posts in Munich and Vienna. It seems that all negotiations have permanently broken down over the proposed agreement we have laid out for our Danubian holdings in the upcoming Hungarian conference. Despite talks of a compromise, even going as far as sending a wholly Bavarian delegation, such attempts were futile with pro-Austrian delegates in the Reichstag having a decisive vote blocking any deal that gives the Bavarians leverage. It seems that old grudges of times past are still fresh within the minds of the Danubians, and it is highly likely that these would throw any chances of us gaining a firm foothold in the quagmire of Central European affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC26.A;When will these two ever get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC27.T;The Hungarian Conference - Invitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC27.D;The recent deposition of the King of Hungary by nobles and the offering of the vacant throne to Sigismund V of the Holy Roman Empire were met with animosity in Scandinavia and Burgundy. After all, Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Great German War, explicitly forbade any member of the Empire’s ruling House of Jagiellon to be King of Hungary. A new European Congress has been called in Venice, Paris being deemed too biased for the Bohemians to be accepted by Burgundy and Scandinavia. As a European Great Power, we have also been invited to the conference where the fate of central Europe will be decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC27.A;Great, some leisure time in Venice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC28.T;The Opening of the Congress of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC28.D;After weeks of preparations and travel, all diplomats and princes invited to address the Hungarian crisis have arrived in Venice. The Serenissima was chosen as a neutral venue after several others were ruled out : Salzburg, Anvers, Paris - all places too partial to one party. The various delegations are being hosted by the great Patrician families of the city and dazzling celebrations and fireworks over the Piazza San Marco have marked the arrival of the last diplomats. Venetian authorities have been careful to place hostile parties at opposite ends of the city to avoid any incidents over the course of the conference, and the protocol for the Congress’ opening has been discussed and reworked countless times. After a mass celebrated in the Saint Mark Basilica by the Patriarch, the diplomats have headed towards the Ducal Palace where the discussions shall start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC28.A;Will peace prevail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC29.T;The Imperial Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC29.D;”The House of Jagiellon was long the steward of the Lands of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen before they passed from the map of Europe. Now that they have returned, the honorable gentlemen of Hungary have made plain the will of the people. We remind the delegates that this crown was not sought out by the Emperor, but given freely by a collection of sagacious men of high standing. Hungary finds herself in a delicate position, beset by internal turmoil which none have to this date succeeded in quieting. It is not surprising, then, that the good Duke of Nitra and his comrades have turned to the German Empire and its Jagiellon primus inter pares to find the stability which the Hungarian realm has recently lacked. His Majesty the Emperor of the Germans and King of Bohemia desires not to seek agglomeration for its own sake, but to calm the fey mood which has swept up the whole Hungarian nation…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC29.A;Obviously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC31.T;The Ottoman Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC31.D;The Bohemian delegation was the first to speak. They advanced absurd arguments to justify their claim upon the Hungarian throne, making no mention of the fact that doing so was a clear breach of the Treaty of Paris. This was expected by the Ottoman delegation, which had long been contemplating the tone to set with their remarks. The majority felt that since Hungary was still claimed de jure by the Ottoman Sultan, the Ottoman delegation should immediately castigate the Jagiellons for their efforts to subvert the Treaty of Paris and usurp rightful Ottoman lands. However, more cautious diplomats were conscious that, the righteousness of the Sultan’s cause aside, reigniting our ancient rivalry with the Holy Roman Empire would compromise our position, and we should instead phrase ourselves as defending established laws. By the time that our men arrived in Venice, it was already decided that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC31.A;Sigismund would get no sympathy from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC31.B;We would focus our words only on upholding the Treaty of Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC32.T;The Scandinavian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC32.D;”We are greatly disquieted to find that, so soon after the guns of Europe had been quieted through the cooperation of the great states of the continent, the specter of war once more haunts us all. Let none of us forget the lost generation of young men who laid down their lives so that we might free ourselves from the barbarous tyranny of internecine bloodshed. This Congress was convened in the spirit of magnanimity and with the highest aspirations, that we might ratify not simply a new peace, but an everlasting bond of fidelity between the nations. The Treaty of Paris was devised towards this end, a landmark of history, the dividing point between an age of chaos on the one hand, and an age of dignity and rationality on the other. An opportunity lies before us all, to build a new European order on a foundation of concord. It is only natural that our fair country should find herself at the head of this great wave…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC32.A;Peace will prevail in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC33.T;The Scandinavian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC33.D;The Scandinavian delegation made a rather forgettable series of remarks which all revolved around upholding the Treaty of Paris and preventing a new Great German War. While it held emotional appeals, it ultimately amounted to little practical substance. Most other delegates quickly dismissed it as mere pablum in service of a so-called “new European order” which the Scandinavians envisioned as being led by themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC33.A;Next!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC34.T;The Burgundian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC34.D;Most observers expected the Burgundian delegation to follow the Scandinavian line of upholding the Treaty of Paris and building a “new European order” founded on diplomacy rather than warfare - an implicit attempt to block Imperial expansion. As we are Scandinavia’s most prominent ally in Europe, this is a logical assumption. However, it is not our only option. Scandinavia currently holds Pomerania, a land once ruled by the Jagiellons and long coveted by them. Emperor Sigismund V’s desire to reclaim it as part of his desire to rebuild the Jagiellon position within the Holy Roman Empire is well known. If we were to subtly undercut Scandinavia’s arguments with our own remarks, while still demanding the Treaty of Paris and in particular Article XVIII be upheld, it could set the stage to draw Sigismund into giving up Hungary in favor of Pomerania, and a free Hungary could be a good ally in the Balkans. Having considered this, when our men arrived in Venice, their remarks…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC34.A;Emphasized our commitment to peace in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC34.B;Made it clear that Scandinavia’s posturing was unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC35.T;The Polish-Lithuanian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC35.D;Of all the countries in attendance at the Congress of Venice, with the possible exception of the Dual Monarchy, our nation has the greatest interest in supporting the Bohemian position. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has long been supported by the Empire against Scandinavia and the Ottomans, not to mention the origins of the House of Jagiellon in our own lands. However, the latest Sejm has underscored the divide within the Commonwealth between the pro-Bohemian faction, the pro-Scandinavian faction, and the pro-Hungarian faction. Thus while most expected the delegation to follow the whims of our new king, another group may have swayed them before their arrival in Venice. To openly break with Emperor Sigismund V, however, could very well provoke a crisis of its own. In light of all this, when our men made their remarks in Venice…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC35.A;They surprised everyone by siding with Scandinavia and Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC35.B;They surprised no one by continuing our support for the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC36.T;The Austrian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC36.D;The very presence of a Danubian delegation at the Congress turned heads in Venice. As one of the few members of the Holy Roman Empire with the clout to challenge the Emperor, and given our representation of the minor Imperial princes as a whole, we had to choose our words carefully to uphold our reputation. In the runup to the Congress, most of our ministers felt that we should conditionally support the Emperor in exchange for mediation regarding Transleithania. This region of the Hungarian borderland has been settled by Germans from across the Empire, but particularly from Austria. Thus we could offer to support the Jagiellon’s claim to the Hungarian throne if they promise to award Transleithania to us. This would of course anger Scandinavia, whose rhetoric has revolved around preserving Hungarian independence. It would also considerably empower the Jagiellons, which will make challenging them in the future even more difficult. With all of this in mind, upon arrival at the Congress, our delegation…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC36.A;Came out in opposition to Imperial rule over Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC36.B;Supported the Emperor on the condition of territorial mediation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC37.T;The Anglois Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC37.D;No country at the Congress of Venice commanded as much authority or influence as the United Kingdom of England and France. We were the leading architects of the Treaty of Paris, and in Venice it fell to us to once again guide the fate of Europe. There had been fierce debate amongst our ministers on whether to back the Jagiellonian claim to the Hungarian throne. It is true that a Jagiellon Hungary would be a nightmare for Scandinavia and Burgundy, our two greatest rivals. Yet the memories of the Great German War, of mad revolutionary Marinus Dahlke and despotic Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V’s attempts to centralize the Empire into one titanic realm, are fresh in our minds. The Crown of St. Stephen could be the first step in an Imperial revival - we should not grant it lightly. Thus, when the time came for our delegation to speak…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC37.A;We stressed the need to uphold the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC37.B;We declared that the Jagiellons are the rightful rulers of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC38.T;The Congress of Venice Adjourns ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC38.D;Scribes had been hard at work in the previous weeks consigning all major speeches given by the diplomats in the Sala di Maggior Consiglio while talks continued throughout the palaces and the rooms where each delegation was hosted. For many the matter of Hungary was soon to be concluded with all major parties having made their opinion known. However, Karl von Schwarzenberg decided to put the Mecklenburg question at the center of the Congress : for if powers were interested in the rights of Hungary, why should they not listen as well to the plight of Mecklenburg, whose people asked for deliverance since the famous Schwerin demonstration of 1838. Following this change of plans, most diplomats have headed back to their countries to make the intentions of their princes and governments known and avoid another diplomatic incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC38.A;More talks and leisure in Venice, truly interesting times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC39.T;The Pomerania Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC39.D;In the aftermath of the Congress of Venice, tensions between pro-Scandinavian and pro-Imperial factions are brewing in northern Germany. Now, some of our more pragmatic ministers have proposed to secretly strike a deal with Emperor Sigismund V. We may be able to convince him to reaffirm his dynasty’s forfeiture of the Hungarian crown - and a guarantee of our influence in the Rhine basin - in exchange for Scandinavian Pomerania. The Jagiellons are currently seeking to use the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz’s claim to the Duchy of Mecklenburg as a stepping stone to claiming all of Scandinavian Germany. It is likely that Sigismund could be persuaded to give up on Hungary in order to acquire it. However, this would mean betraying Scandinavia, our greatest ally, to say nothing of how it might enable the Jagiellons to consolidate dangerous levels of power amongst the Germans. Still, it would avert any chance of either the Pomeranian or Hungarian issues drawing Europe into a greater crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC39.A;Reichstadt is nice this time of year, perfect for a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC39.B;No, we will not throw Scandinavia to the wolves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC40.T;A Reichstadt Convention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC40.D;The Burgundian ambassador has secretly met with our foreign minister in Reichstadt to present an unusual offer. Anvers have noted with alarm the growing tensions in Pomerania over the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz’s claims, and has proposed a secret treaty that would pledge their support to the Imperial reclamation of the Baltic coast in exchange for two things : our complete disavowal of the Hungarian crown, and a guarantee of Burgundian influence in the Rhenish and Westphalian Circles (northwestern Germany). This is a rather shocking act, given the historic Burgundian-Scandinavian alliance, but the liberation of Pomerania would likely prove of greater value to our efforts to consolidate Germany compared to the Hungarian crown. Of course, it would also give Burgundy a chance to make inroads into both Hungary and Germany, and we could always seek to claim Hungary now and regain Pomerania in the future…The final choice is in the hands of the Emperor. What say you, Your Imperial Majesty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC40.A;We find these conditions acceptable, sign the Reichstadt Convention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC40.B;The Crown of Hungary is more valuable than Pomerania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC41.T;Austria Demands Hungarian Territory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC41.D;During the Congress of Venice, we were surprised when the Austrian representative largely supported our claim to Hungary. However, at the time they made reference to seeking “territorial mediations,” and now they have made plain their meaning. In exchange for supporting Emperor Sigismund V’s candidacy for the Hungarian crown, Austria desires to annex Transleithania, the western Hungarian border region long settled by various waves of Danubian colonists and immigrants, many descended from Austrians. Most of our ministers find this demand impudent and above their station, but we should remember that Austria has been chosen to represent the minor German princes of the Holy Roman Empire at large. §RRebuking them could allow them to turn the rest of the Empire against us and end any chance of claiming Hungary.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC41.A;They think too highly of themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC41.B;A small price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC42.T;Austrian Denouncement ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC42.D;Austrian foreign minister Rudolph von Polz, head of his delegation, issued a withering condemnation of Emperor Sigismund V this morning over his “trampling of the rights and privileges of the Imperial Estates in pursuit of the Crown of St. Stephen.” He portrayed the Emperor as attempting to circumvent the entire structure of the Holy Roman Empire and permanently tip the balance of internal politics in the Jagiellons’ favor, and concluded by announcing the immediate withdrawal of Austria from the Congress. News of this is already spreading across the Empire. Many minor German princes are now questioning the implications of what a Jagiellon Hungary would mean for the Empire at large, and they are not comforted by their answers. A tide of opposition to Sigismund’s acquisition of Hungary is rapidly building and the Magyars may now lie beyond our reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC42.A;Damn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC43.T;Start of the Second Congress of Venice ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC43.D;The Congress reconvenes and it has lost its novelty : most Venetians did not bother to come and greet the delegations at the Piazza San Marco, and in truth the fireworks and banquets offered by the Republic were far less generous than during the first opening. For many patricians it also means more expenses, and some delegations have already been relocated elsewhere in the city because of some bad memories of their stay. Nonetheless, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who has decided to come plea for himself, has been the focus of all gossips. Many journalists describing this tall and courteous man as “the best representative of the Teutonic stock this land has seen since Barbarossa”. Now after a new common mass in the Basilicate, the delegates have walked again towards the Ducal Palace to hear the new speeches and hopefully settle the matter of both Hungary and Mecklenburg-Pomerania peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC43.A;Europe is counting on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC44.T;The Degrelle-von Schwartzenberg Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC44.D;The Second Congress of Venice was supposed to begin today, with delegations returning to the Serenissima's capital to address the issue of Pomerania. However, shortly after proceedings were opened, Burgundian foreign minister Maxime Degrelle and Imperial foreign minister Karl von Schwartzenberg made a pair of speeches in which they announced an “agreement” on the “Pomeranian question” had been reached. The whole assembly was stunned to learn that Emperor Sigismund V was willing to completely disavow Hungary on the condition of Scandinavia immediately ceding Pomerania to the Empire - and that Burgundy supported this arrangement! The chamber descended into pandemonium, with the Scandinavian delegation outraged, and the Anglois delegation similarly furious. It seems Burgundy wanted a free Hungary more than a Nordic alliance. The day ended with most delegates abandoning the Congress, and all eyes are now on Scandinavia to see if they will abide by this Faustian bargain between their greatest rival and their once-greatest ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC44.A;Unto that Power he doth belong Which only doeth Right while ever willing Wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC45.T;The Burgundian Backstab;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC45.D;The unthinkable has happened. Burgundy - whether to “ensure Hungarian independence,” as they have publicly stated, or for some perverse reason known only to themselves - has sided with Sigismund V and demanded that we cede Pomerania to the Holy Roman Empire. The enormity of this betrayal by our ancient ally, the only other great Protestant power in Europe, cannot be understated, but at present we must address the grim reality of the situation. If we surrender Pomerania then all hope of advancing further into northern Germany or consolidating the Baltic coast may be dashed, and the integrity of our realm imperiled - if nothing else then it would certainly be the death knell of the Unionster Party’s popularity. If we refuse, then we will have to face the Holy Roman Empire and its allies without anyone else by our side. Regardless of our choice, Scandinavia now faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC46.D;“The House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, scions of a venerable line, has since time immemorial ruled the duchy which bears the name of their noble dynasty, but as of late this rightful land has been usurped from them. The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland has transgressed upon the ancient domains of Mecklenburg, reducing this once-proud member of the German Empire to the last sliver of their realm. For as long as the Duchy of Mecklenburg remains under the unlawful occupation of the Scandinavian Crown, the German Empire shall be bereft of both its integrity and its security. Shall we leave the heart of Europe stranded upon the rocks of discord for the sake of Scandinavian imperial vainglory? Restitution is the only acceptable answer. The Duchy of Mecklenburg must be restored in full, and to its complete natural size with the venerable Duke Adolf V as their leader…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC46.A;Obviously!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC47.T;The Imperial Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC47.D;Karl von Schwarzenberg, foreign minister of the Holy Roman Empire, was the first delegate to speak at the Second Congress of Venice. He made a long-winded address in which he discussed the House of Mecklenburg, an old but minor noble dynasty of northeastern Germany, and its claim on western Pomerania. His argument for the return of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz’s lands to Imperial control soon spiralled into a complicated attempt to advocate for the Empire to take control of all of Scandinavian Pomerania. Some delegates were totally confused by his rhetoric, but most dismissed it as Jagiellon saber-rattling and a melodramatic effort to use a minor prince’s grievances as a weapon against their Nordic rival. It is hardly the first time that Scandinavia and the Empire have sparred, even verbally, over Pomerania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC47.A;Really? This again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC48.T;The Scandinavian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC48.D;”The CRIMINAL EMPEROR in Prague,” roared Dag Mikkelsen, Scandinavian foreign minister, “would have this honored assembly believe that the Treaty of Paris and all of its provisions were nothing but a scrap of paper, to be thrown out with the evening refuse. Not content to seek the Kingdom of Hungary and, through the basest deception imaginable, exploit her moment of weakness to clamp the Crown of Saint Stephen down upon his head, he now schemes - yes, SCHEMES, gentlemen! - to advance a spurious agenda against the Scandinavian realm. His honorable representative speaks of the House of Mecklenburg, but when did that house rule over all of Pomerania? And if, gentlemen, we were to accept his argument, what then would be the result? Shall we see the borders of Europe completely overturned, day after day, at the whims of any petty noble? Our nations, including the German Empire, signed the Treaty of Paris for a reason. Dispense with that reasoning, and we shall dispense with the very notion of law…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC49.D;”The CRIMINAL EMPEROR in Prague would have this honored assembly believe that the Treaty of Paris and all of its provisions were nothing but a scrap of paper, to be thrown out with the evening refuse…Shall we see the borders of Europe completely overturned, day after day, at the whims of any petty noble? Our nations, including the German Empire, signed the Treaty of Paris for a reason. Dispense with that reasoning, and we shall dispense with the very notion of law.” - Dag Mikkelsen, Scandinavian foreign minister\n\nThe Scandinavian delegation issued an impassioned denunciation of the Holy Roman Empire’s violation of both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Paris. They urged the delegates to defend Hungarian independence and reject the Imperial claim to any of Pomerania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC50.D;”This honored body has been convened for a sole purpose : to uphold the Treaty of Paris. It was not brought forth to settle ancient grudges, to give rise to new agendas of intrigue, or to allow one party an advantage over another. Those notions were precisely the fallacious and barbarous errors which the Treaty of Paris was drafted, signed, and ratified to defend against. The representatives of all the great and ancient states of Europe affixed their signatures to that document with the intention of exorcising the scourge of cyclical animosity from this continent forever. Let us not resurrect that foul shade, and by doing so render all the efforts of this generation, for naught. To cast down the Treaty, not by accident or fell circumstance, but by concerted effort, would augur ill for any hope of understanding between the nations going forward…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC51.T;The Polish-Lithuanian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC51.D;Unlike the previous Congress, support for the Jagiellon position regarding Pomerania amongst the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth’s delegation was far from unanimous. While many delegates were eager to weaken Scandinavia and reduce their presence in the Baltic, many others were cognizant of just how much more powerful the Empire would become by regaining Pomerania. There was also a third, more neutral group, who saw the question as irrelevant to the Commonwealth itself, unlike the Hungarian Question. These divisions mostly reflected the positions of the pro-Imperial, pro-Scandinavian, and pro-Hungarian candidates of the last Sejm. Thus it seemed logical that whichever candidate had prevailed would use his influence as king, however limited, to tilt the balance in his favor. For that reason, the Polish-Lithuanian delegation ultimately…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC51.A;Supported the status quo and upholding the Treaty of Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC51.B;Sided with the Jagiellons and the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC52.T;The Ottoman Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC52.D;The Ottoman delegation at the Second Congress of Venice was notably relaxed compared to the one which had attended the First. Pomerania was of little relevance to the Sublime Ottoman State, and the matter was seen strictly through the lens of opposing their old rivals in Prague. Thus it was felt that they could side with Scandinavia without such a position being seen as a direct attack against the Jagiellons, but rather as a commitment to upholding the Treaty of Paris. However, there was also a somewhat renegade minority amongst the delegation, who latched on to the theory (favored by some Burgundian delegates as well) that by strengthening the Jagiellon’s commitments in the Empire proper, they would be dissuaded from Balkan adventurism. Therefore some Turkish delegates advocated for the Imperial claim to Pomerania solely to redirect its attention from Hungary. In the end, the position which won out was…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC52.A;The anti-Imperial majority’s defense of the Treaty of Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC52.B;The pro-Imperial minority’s pragmatic support of the Jagiellons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC53.T;The Austrian Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC53.D;The Second Congress of Venice was puzzled by the Austrians’ vague remarks. This vagueness was due to the fact that, at the time, the Austrians were in heated private negotiations with the Imperial delegates over internal Danubian politics. Austrian foreign minister Rudolph von Polzl had been instructed to pressure the Jagiellons to adopt a policy of supporting Austria in all “regional disputes” going forward. This was a clear reference to the Electorate of Bavaria, who had emerged as Austria’s rival for Danubian dominance. If Imperial foreign minister Karl von Schwarzenberg refused this request - which was more akin to a demand - then the Austrians were prepared to denounce the Jagiellons in public. Given Austria’s role as representative of the minor Imperial princes at large, this would almost certainly ruin any hope of the Emperor gaining internal support for the House of Mecklenburg and thus Pomerania’s return. Of course, some delegates saw negotiation as useless and urged support for Scandinavia solely to weaken the Jagiellons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC53.A;Cut off negotiations, we utterly refuse to aid Jagiellon expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC53.B;Keep pressing the Emperor’s men for a deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC54.T;The Austrians Make an “Offer”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC54.D;The arrogance of the Archduchy of Austria continues to know no bounds. After having demanded Transleithania in exchange for their support during the last Congress, they have now once again approached our representatives in private with more imperious desires. This time they want a commitment from the Emperor that Austria will be supported over Bavaria in any further regional disputes between the two powers! Their excuse is that this would improve Imperial stability and act as a check on Bavarian expansionism. While the nature of such an agreement would keep us from being obligated to commit to it, the consequences for our reputation amongst the German princes of going back on our word could be dire. At the same time, Imperial patronage could allow Austria to accumulate a dangerous level of influence in the region. §RIf we want to secure the German princes’ backing for the Imperial claim on Pomerania, however, then we have no other choice.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC54.A;§RThe Austrians forget their place!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC54.B;A necessary sacrifice for the sake of the Jagiellon dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC55.T;Austrian Delegates Denounce the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC55.D;The Imperial representatives terminated negotiations last night, going so far as to accuse us (and implicitly, our Archduke) of insubordination. Thus, foreign minister von Polzl issued a withering condemnation of Emperor Sigismund V this morning over his “shameless exploitation of the Imperial Estates in pursuit of blatant adventurism.” He castigated the Emperor for using the grievances of the House of Mecklenburg as a weapon both against Scandinavia and to increase his own dynasty’s power, which could permanently tip the balance of internal politics in the Jagiellons’ favor. Von Polzl concluded by announcing the immediate withdrawal of Austria from the Congress. News of this is already spreading across the Holy Roman Empire. Many minor German princes are now questioning the true intentions of the Emperor in this dispute with the Nordics, and they are not comforted by their answers. A tide of opposition to Sigismund’s Pomeranian gambit is rapidly building and we may have destroyed his efforts to claim it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC55.A;You are terminated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC56.T;The Anglois Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC56.D;Once again, it falls to the United Kingdom of England and France to have the last word amongst the nations of Europe. The Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia have both made their cases for control of Pomerania. We are the only great power in Europe which the Empire could call its ally, even if that “alliance” has more often been simply our common interests of defending Catholicism and keeping Burgundy, Scandinavia, and the Turks in check. Yet by aiding the Empire, we would be scorning the Treaty of Paris and emerging notions of international law. There is also the fact that Emperor Sigismund V has made no secret of his aims to continue his father Wenceslaus V’s efforts to consolidate the Empire back into a single realm, which could allow the Jagiellons to control the fate of Europe. Scandinavia has long been one of the twin shepherds of Protestantism alongside Burgundy, and a great thorn in our side, but we must ask ourselves : Is weakening the Stuarts worth opening the door to a centralized Holy Roman Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC56.A;We must uphold the Treaty of Paris and the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC56.B;Only Pomerania’s return will guarantee peace in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC57.D;”Article I.

No territorial changes have been made and all attempts to restore Imperial control over Pomerania have failed. This is a major setback for both the Jagiellon dynasty and pan-German nationalists, and may embolden Scandinavia to seek further gains in northern Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No territorial changes have been made and all attempts to impose Imperial control over Pomerania have failed.

Even better, the Szent Korona has been returned. In a grand ceremony in Buda, Krisztofer was finally and properly coronated as King of Hungary!

Hedwig, the duchess, is married to Sigismund V’s cousin. This marriage has now become a burden due to Hedwig’s enormous unpopularity as an absentee Bohemiophile and former Protestant whose conversion to Catholicism has always been suspect.

As soon as word was received in Prague, our armies crossed the border to link up with the anti-Kemény forces led by Duke Gabor of Nitra and march on Buda.

Rallying the Protestant faithful and the anti-Bohemian nobility of Transylvania, he has declared himself the heir to Krisztofer’s titles. Eastern Hungary has slid back into chaos as loyalists flock to the pretender’s banner, while Austria moves in from the west to secure its agreed-upon claim to Transleithania.

HUNC69.T;The Final Act of the Congress of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC69.D;The Congress of Venice has ended, for better or worse, future will tell. The organization of this grand diplomatic avenue has stretched the limits of the Venetian Republic funds but has brought even more prestige to the Serenissima. Along the diplomats followed journalists, artists and writers who came to witness the first grand diplomatic venue since the Treaty of Paris and the end of the Great German Wars. A small book called “Vers la paix perpétuelle” from the Anglois thinker Nicolas Lavisse has gained attention throughout Europe as the philosopher argues that a permanent diplomatic stage such as this temporary Congress would allow the world to transition to a new perpetual peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC70.T;Scandinavia Cedes Pomerania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC70.D;It had been rumored that Scandinavia was planning to withdraw from the Congress and refuse to recognize its results should it have created any treaty that would have forced them to cede their German lands. However the support of Burgundy for our cause compelled them to realize the futility of such an action. Therefore they have returned Mecklenburg and Pomerania to Imperial control, evacuating all civil and military personnel from the region. We are amused to learn that this had caused a political crisis within Scandinavia, but right now we must focus upon reintegrating the long-estranged eastern German coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC71.T;Scandinavia Defies Us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUNC71.D;Despite Burgundy’s support for the restoration of Imperial lands occupied by Scandinavia, the perfidious Nordics refused to see reason. They have asserted that their rule over the eastern German coast is “unquestionable,” and have in essence dared us to enforce our demands by force! We now have a choice to make. We would be perfectly within our rights to declare a Reichskrieg against Scandinavia and rally the Imperial Estates to the liberation of the north. Yet to use diplomatic means to ensure that the rest of the great powers officially denounce Scandinavia and recognize the Empire’s right to the north would go a long way towards rebuilding our reputation…while still leaving the door upon to punish Scandinavia in the future at a moment of our choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC72.D;”It is harsh in the world, whoredom rife - an axe age, a sword age - shields are riven - a wind age, a wolf age - before the world goes headlong. No man will have mercy on another.” - The Völuspá, as recorded in the Poetic Edda, Volume II\n\nSince the days of the Norse, Scandinavian powers have sought control over the Baltic. That conflict has now once more led Scandinavia into conflict with Bohemia, long the protector of the Germans and recently recovering its strength. While the spark of this conflict sprung from failed negotiations in Venice, it is rooted in the struggle for dominance of northern Germany between the two powers. Only total victory will save Scandinavia’s position amongst the Elbian Germans. Anything less will end their authority in the region and confirm the Empire’s rule in the north. This war shall be the Twilight of the Gods - but which gods? Those in Copenhagen, or those in Prague?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC73.D;Fortune has not favored Scandinavia. Bohemia has driven us out of Germany in its entirety and we have been unable to reclaim our lands, forcing us to sue for peace. The resulting treaty has stripped us of all German-speaking lands east of Holstein. The Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz has merged his crown with that of old Pomerania into a united duchy with the Emperor’s blessing, and Bohemia has proven her credentials as the standard bearer of German leadership. The announcement of this treaty has provoked apocalyptic fury across Scandinavian society towards the Unionster government. Many are calling not merely for the administration’s resignation, but for its overthrow, in the face of this unmitigated disaster. The military is particularly irate at our failure and blames political interference from the civilian leadership for “stabbing Scandinavia in the back.” Liberal or reactionary revolution could come at any moment and any possibility of advancing Scandinavian rule over Germany has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HUNC74.D;At last, the injustices of the early 17th century have been undone, and the northern frontier of the Empire has been liberated. As a sign of generosity, Emperor Sigismund V has not seized the area for himself, but has instead crowned Duke Erwin III von Mecklenburg-Strelitz as the Duke of Pomerania, allowing him to merge his old title into his new one. The House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz shall no doubt be quite grateful for this service and will dutifully rule the region in our stead until the Empire can be fully reconsolidated. Most of all we have proven our merit as the defender of the German people and shown the world that the Empire remains a force to be reckoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Pro-Imperial partisans are being rooted out across our German territories and the Great Powers have been forced to restore their recognition of our legitimate rule in the region. We should not rest upon our laurels - this has not solved the issue of German nationalism within our realm forever - but for the short term we have foiled any attempt by the Emperor to lay claim to our lands. Most of all we have proven that the Empire has grown weak, and that the future of Germany is up for grabs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUNC76.D;Fortune has not favored the Jagiellons. Scandinavia has shattered our offensive and thwarted all attempts to advance into Mecklenburg, forcing us to sue for peace. The resulting treaty has reaffirmed their rule over the north. The Stuarts have compelled the international community to once more recognize their ownership of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, ending any chance of restoring the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz there. The announcement of this treaty has provoked apocalyptic fury amongst our subjects towards the Emperor and his court. Many are calling not merely for the current administration’s resignation, but for its overthrow, in the face of this unmitigated disaster. The military is particularly irate at our failure and blames political interference from the civilian leadership for “stabbing the Empire in the back.” Liberal or reactionary revolution could come at any moment and the rebirth of the Empire has suffered a dire setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH0.D;We are a member of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, bound by its laws and customs, weak as they have become. While the Treaty of Paris in 1820 reduced the internal authority of the Emperor and the machinery of the Empire down to unprecedented lows, we remain bound within its structure. This includes the centuries-old law of the Ewiger Landfriede or “Eternal Public Peace,” a requirement that claims between Imperial nobles be decided through the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court), the lower court of the Empire (compared to the Reichshofrat or Aulic Council, the highest court in the realm and which tends to side with the Emperor), rather than by war. While Ewiger Landfriede was originally intended as a means to keep lesser nobles in check by the Imperial Princes, its modern iteration amounts to a ban on independent military actions by the princes of the Empire. §RIt would take a crisis of epic proportions to shatter the Ewiger Landfriede.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH00.D;Ewiger Landfriede, or “Eternal Public Peace,” is a late 15th-century Imperial ban on the medieval right of fehderecht (vendetta), requiring that claims between Imperial princes be decided by the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court), the lower court of the Empire (compared to the Reichshofrat or Aulic Council, the highest court), rather than by war. It was originally conceived by influential Imperial princes to quash the squabbles of minor nobles. This also led to the Reichskammergericht’s establishment, but the Emperor responded by creating the Reichshofrat, an even higher court. Historically speaking, the Ewiger Landfriede has rarely been able to be enforced. The Treaty of Paris in 1820, which ended the Great German War, required that the Jagiellons respect the Ewiger Landfriede as a condition of regaining the Imperial throne. §RWe will need to address the status of the Empire before we can regain control of our military affairs, lest we spark a general European crisis.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH1.T;The Inauguration of the Wenceslaus V Plaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.D;Wenceslaus V, Holy Roman Emperor, reigned throughout the German Revolution and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning and intellect, he had quashed the liberals that had given the Empire so much grief while simultaneously fending off coalition after coalition keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe. But he was too successful for his own good, and "the Lion of the North", as he was called after his manyfold victories against the Scandinavians, was eventually forced to sue for peace. He would be murdered the following year and succeeded by his son, Sigismund V, who after a pompous ceremony today had opened a plaza in Prague which lauded his reactionary father’s many achievements. The young emperor promised loftily before a crowd of thousands that his reign will be no less stellar than the last to bear the Imperial Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH2.T;Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.D;Sigismund V came to power at the tender age of ten following his father’s unceremonious assassination. Those of his old enemies who survived the Revolution denied their involvement in the affair, and rumors indeed abound that the perpetrators hailed from the Bohemian aristocracy, but it had always been clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of liberals and republicans. Despite his unfortunate upbringing, Sigismund clearly inherited both his father’s desires for statecraft and his drive to unite the Empire under Bohemian leadership. His staunch, reactionary inclinations, fostered by his mother and her priest entourage has led to tensions with his Chancellor and former Regent, Karl von Schwarzenberg. Time will tell if the Minister can endure his diplomatic endeavors or if the absolutists inclination of the young emperor will prove too strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH7.T;Creation of the Wolfgang Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.D;The elder branch of the House of Jagiellon, to which the kings of Bohemia belong, deeply distrust the intentions of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karlstein, which would succeed to the throne of Bohemia should the senior branch die out. Sigismund Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein is the head of this cadet branch which grew infamous during the Great German War for having championed the liberal cause. This eventually led to the assassination of the father of Wolfgang, who dropped his first two names which were associated with the elder branch. Today, Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein announced in Dresden the creation of the Wolfgang Society which occupies itself with reformist tendencies, which seem to have gained ground among our population.

In the third stanza, with a call for "Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit" (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail.

HREBOH1.T;The Bayreuth Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH1.D;In the years after the Great German War, the Electorate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold who allied with Wenceslaus V and received Nürnberg as a reward, transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany. Prince-Elector Leopold IV, Duke of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are among the reasons behind the proclamation by the chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Bayreuth throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH1.A;Reformation is better than a new revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH2.T;The Fall of von Schwarzenberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH2.D;History would first remember Karl von Schwarzenberg as the Architect of Europe, having navigated Bohemia to its present esteem despite the inconclusive Great German War, then as Imperial Regent for Sigismund V following Wenceslaus IV's untimely death, then as Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite his many titles, however, his former charge would prove no large amount of them can quell an Emperor incensed when he released the now-former Chancellor from his duties following the dismal outcome of the Hungarian Conference. Sigismund later appointed as his new Chancellor Josef von Nostitz-Drzewiecky, an old family friend, to neither fanfare nor outcry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH2.A;Such is the Emperor’s will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH3.T;Following the Bayreuth Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HREBOH3.D;Exile poets, would-be revolutionaries and other such liberal apologists have streamed to Brandenburg-Bayreuth in increasing numbers ever since its lunatic chancellery enacted reform after reform under the Bayreuth Constitution's remit. While this is a clear affront to Imperial authority over Germany, normally resolved through a ‘thorough restoration of the status quo', the Emperor had granted von Nostitz-Drzewiecky his blessing to resolve ‘the situation in Bayreuth’ as he saw fit. Those beseeching clemency for the liberals were countermanded by those who claim the Charter’s continued existence undermines the Empire’s stability, leaving it vulnerable to Burgundian and Scandinavian infiltration. Yet the Ewiger Landfriede, strengthened by the Treaty of Paris, forbids using military force to solve internal Imperial disputes - except in cases of dire emergency. Having considered both perspectives, the Chancellor said…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HREBOH3.A;"Their ‘Constitution’ will make fine boot scrubbers for our men!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Now I, Sigismund V, Holy Roman Emperor by the grace of God, King of Bohemia, King of Germany, &c., &c., do hereby subject Prince-Elector Leopold IV to an Imperial ban : and that the person aforesaid is as free as a bird until his offending laws are revoked forthwith..."\n\nSigismund V retracted his blessing shortly after hearing of von Nostitz-Drzewiecky’s lenient stance towards the Bayreuth Constitution. His subsequent ultimatum is unlikely to be obeyed and thus he has argued that the Ewiger Landfriede must temporarily be suspended so that the Reichsarmee can protect the security of the Empire. Noticeably, he has not consulted the Reichshofrat to do this, let alone the Reichstag…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HREBOH5.T;The $YEAR$ Great Fire of Nuremberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HREBOH5.D;The days that followed the tragedy were rife with finger-pointing. The aggrieved of Nuremberg cast theirs at a squad of Bohemians who’d set fire to a bakery after shooting everyone within : the Imperial Army denies such malice aforethought. Whichever the truth, its resulting facts lay clear in three quarters of a once-proud city in cinders, and thousands of charred corpses to come along with. While the good Duke Leopold nurses his wounds in Londres and his more conservative brother Hermann III bears the onerous task of rebuilding his capital, Sigismund returns to Prague having lit a fire not just in Nuremberg but in the heart of every German from the Danube to the Rhine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HREBOH6.T;A Headless Lion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH6.D;His Imperial Majesty the Emperor has begun to reconsider his neglect of the foreign office. Up until now it was the opinion of our sovereign that it represented a needless drain on the treasury, and that he and his cabinet could handle things by themselves. The disaster in Nuremberg, however, has thrown that into question. Emperor Sigismund has begrudgingly come to terms with his relative inexperience in orchestrating foreign policy, especially after numerous reports of anti-Jagiellon sentiment flaring up across southern Germany the likes of which have not been seen since the days of Marinus Dahlke. Thus he has reinvested new funds into the foreign office and reappointed Karl von Schwarzenberg as Chancellor, awarding Josef von Nostitz-Drzewiecky a substantial sinécure as compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH6.A;We can still undo the damages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH7.T;The Obvious Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH7.D;The Burning of Nuremberg has shocked all of Germany but what worries Wilhelm IV goes beyond this incident. The Emperor has, on his own initiative, broken the Ewiger Landfriede and removed a prince of the Empire, and not just anyone, but one of the seven Electors. This unparalleled assault upon the rights of the Imperial Princes of the Blood cannot be tolerated! We must defend the rights of the Electors, and of our fellow Danubian Germans. To this end, Duke-Elector Wilhelm has taken two actions. First he held a meeting of princes and bishops from across the German highlands to draft a petition to the Emperor demanding a convocation of the Reichstag to hold a vote on the fate of Bayreuth. He has also organized a broader council meeting of German princes to be held in Munich whether or not the Emperor permits the Reichstag to be convened. If the Reichstag fails us then we may need to take extreme measures to protect the rights of our people from the Emperor…possibly including a new union of princes to defend against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH7.A;We shall not be led like sheep to the slaughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH8.T;An Envoy from Bavaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH8.D;The Emperor’s dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth has sent shockwaves throughout the Empire. Nobody knows where the sovereign’s autocratic streak will end and few are interested in finding out. Now Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV of Bavaria has decided to take action. He has petitioned for an immediate Reichstag vote on the fate of Bayreuth, but he has also announced the convening of a pan-German council to discuss possible measures to defend against further Imperial encroachment. None of our ministers can say where such discussions may lead but it is obvious that further German unity is necessary if we are to survive Sigismund’s predations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH8.A;Of course we will attend the meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH9.T;The Second Imperial Incident : The Danubian Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH9.D;Our dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth and the subsequent Fire of Nuremberg has raised hackles along the Danube, and no German realm is more angered by our actions than Bavaria. This act of royal interference in defiance of the Ewiger Landfriede has especially angered the Danubians as it was an attack on one of their own cultural kin. Thus the Bavarians and other Danubian princes and bishops have demanded an immediate convocation of the Reichstag to hold a vote on the fate of Bayreuth. Ominously, Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV of Bavaria has also organized a pan-German council in Munich to rally German nationalism against Imperial control. Thus the Emperor is tempted to reject the petition in order to demonstrate his displeasure at Bavaria’s actions, but von Schwartzenberg has urged him to at the very least withdraw all Bohemian troops from Bayreuth as an act of goodwill. Allowing the vote will almost certainly lead to the princes voting in Leopold’s favor and will humiliate us before our own vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH9.A;Hold the vote, if the princes want Leopold to be an elector again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH10.T;The Third Imperial Incident : The Land Diet of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH10.D;The Kingdom of Bohemia has had a long-standing Diet, known as the Land Diet, which has permitted the Czech Upper Class, most notably the Nobility, to have considerable influence over the internal workings of the Kingdom via the advising of rulers on what policies they should enact. Supported by the Liberals and the general public (who mistakenly think the aristocracy represent them in good will), the nobility has once again called for a Diet, something not seen since the crowning of King Wenceslaus V. Now Sigismund V, in his capacity as King of Bohemia, must decide on whether to hold the Diet, or take this opportunity to abolish the practice altogether. Rumors are swirling that the Czech nobles’ first priority will be to reduce Sigismund’s powers to make war, in light of the Bayreuth fiasco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH10.A;§RAbolish the Diet! Defeatism is unacceptable!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH10.B;Host the Diet, we must relieve pressure on the Crown somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH11.T;The Land Diet - The Matter of German Representation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH11.D;With the Diet now being organized, King Sigismund now has a choice to make regarding its composition. Chancellor von Schwartzenberg could draft a plan on how best to include the Germans living in the long-held possessions of Saxony and Brandenburg in the new Diet. This would not only make him many allies within the German Nobility, it would also dilute the power and influence of the old and deeply rooted Czech Aristocracy. However he could also pander to the Czech aristocrats by providing them vast privileges within the new Diet that will forever entrench the Czechs as the ruling force of the Kingdom, granting him a strong power base with which to pass policies. Naturally, the Chancellor has urged him to avoid such chauvinism, reminding him that he is “king of the Bohemians, but Emperor of the Germans.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH11.A;§RVon Schwartzenberg is right, representation for ALL citizens.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH11.B;Czechs are the foundation of this kingdom, not Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH12.T;The Land Diet Convenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH12.D;For the first time in over a generation, the Land Diet of Bohemia has been convened in Prague, with nobles gathered from across the realm to represent their lands before the King. In the Diet, the Bohemian nobility expressed their contempt for Liberalism but also declared further war a threat to manorial society. During the Great German War, Wenceslaus drafted a law exempting any family from robota (serfdom) if their son volunteered for the army. This led to a surge of recruitment in the Czech countryside and practically ended serfdom in Bohemia, with the rest being freed during the Regency of Sigismund. Thus the Czech nobility, fearing further instability and empowerment of the peasantry, tabled several measures to curtail the King of Bohemia’s war powers. However all such measures were thwarted by the German nobility. Aghast at the specter of liberalism and nationalism now haunting the Danubian lands, they have demanded that we stand ready to crush any further assaults upon the ancient foundations of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH12.A;Truer words were never spoken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We have been able to water these measures down but we could not stop their passage entirely and it seems that we will continue to struggle to operate our military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH14.T;Death of Rudolf von Hesse-Kassel;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH14.D;The Margraviate of Hesse-Kassel is one of the last remnants of feudalism and split inheritances in the Empire, ruling over four disconnected fiefs : the Landgraviate of Kassel, the county of Hanau-Schlüchtberg, the county of Lippe and the county of Nassau-Wiesbaden. Our margrave, Rudolf von Hesse-Kassel, is currently bedridden with typhus and doctors believe that he is not long for this world. Unfortunately he is also heirless and every power around is trying to get him to nominate their prince as heir. While the lands themselves are no more valuable than most in the region, their unusually muddled legal status has offered the German princess of the region an unprecedented opportunity to expand their power at little cost to themselves if they can get their claimants in position. Ominous reports indicate that the Kingdom of Burgundy is “investigating” an old claim by a western Rhenish count under their protection to the County of Nassau-Wiesbaden. If they press it then the matter may escalate into a crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its margrave, Rudolf von Hesse-Kassel, having never produced any children, chose Duke Konrad von Nassau to succeed him shortly before dying of typhus last night, but the inheritance is still being contested. Our bureaucrats in the Rhine have discovered that the archbishopric of Mainz held several small fiefs in Wiesbaden that, while currently dormant, were never officially relinquished. Thus we now have a pretext to occupy the county of Nassau-Wiesbaden and integrate it into our own Duchy of the Rhine. Needless to say the Duke of Nassau will not be pleased but we should not pass up a chance to consolidate our eastern frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its margrave, Rudolf von Hesse-Kassel, having never produced any children, chose Duke Konrad of Nassau to succeed him shortly before dying of typhus. However Burgundy is seeking to claim the county of Nassau-Wiesbaden, citing the “ancient rights of the archbishop of Mainz.” Now Duke Konrad has appeared before the Reichstag to demand that the Margraviate of Hesse-Kassel be given to him as Rudolf wanted - including Wiesbaden. This has in turn caused the lords of Darmstadt and Lüneburg to protest that they, too, hold claims to Hesse-Kassel lands, and therefore deserve their fair share. §RHowever we choose to settle the matter, if we have previously promised to respect Burgundy’s presence in the Rhine then betraying them may be unwise…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH17.T;The Braunschweig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH17.D;Duke Karl von Braunschweig is quite hated by his subjects for his dubious personal choices. Despite being over forty years old, he has remained single all of his life, and entertains various artists and actors with ducal funds rather than invest it into the realm. Duke Karl has praised the Thuringian model of decentralization though his court is filled with Scandinavian advisors who would prefer his distant relative and heir, our Elector Friedrich von Lüneburg, take over his estates. Now the plotters have finally struck - Duke Karl was taken unaware in the early morning while still in his bed, forced to abdicate and to flee abroad. We are thus the leading candidate to assume control over Braunschweig, but not all is well. Karl is building support for his restoration to the throne while in exile. If the Jagiellons possess the means and the resolve to do so then there is little that we could do to stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH17.A;Let us hope that matters proceed without further issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH18.T;The Braunschweig Rout;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH18.D;Restorationist sentiment amongst Karl’s few remaining influential supporters ultimately did not amount to much. The Bohemians, having expressed little interest in the Ernestine duchies union, were similarly apathetic at the ousted duke’s plight. A few elderly officers of the ducal army attempted to take back the royal castle along with the small amount of the soldiers that they were able to cajole or browbeat into obedience, but this farcical band was rapidly disarmed with minimal violence, and the rest of the military supported the coup. With no further resistance in sight, Elector Friedrich von Lüneburg has been proclaimed Duke of Braunschweig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH18.A;Es lebe der Herzog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH19.T;Failure in Braunschweig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH19.D;Karl’s plan to court outside intervention to restore him to the throne has unfortunately borne fruit. After a small band of elderly Braunschweiger officers and some nervous-looking young soldiers under their command was driven away from the royal castle, a much larger force arrived from Anhalt : the Reichsarmee, led by famous Bohemian general Klement von Fucík. Our own forces were rapidly expelled from Braunschweig after a brief struggle and the whole duchy is once again in Karl’s hands. All is not lost, however : Our Elector remains the far more popular candidate for the throne and we are prepared to take this matter before the Reichstag to attempt to gain by parliamentary vote what we could not through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH19.A;We must not give up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH20.T;The Fifth Imperial Incident : The Braunschweig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH20.D;Duke Karl von Braunschweig, loathed for his effeminate profligacy, was recently the target of a coup attempt by loyalists of Elector Friedrich von Lüneberg, who wished for him to take up the throne instead and merge their realms together. While we were able to deploy the Reichsarmee to protect the Ewiger Landfriede and restore Karl to his throne, this crisis has shown the weakness of the Duke of Braunschweig, and the charges against him cannot be denied. Now the Reichstag has been convened to arbitrate the matter, and the Emperor must decide whether to force him into the Saxon Duchies union or to let the Elector of Lüneberg proceed with his assumption of the ducal crown. Von Lüneberg could easily be swayed to cast out the Scandinavian advisors which Karl filled his court with in exchange for Braunschweig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH21.T;The State of the Reichsarmee;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH21.D;A report demanded by Sigismund over the armed forces at his disposition has highlighted several problems : by the War of the Second Coalition, the Imperial armies needed men, with many conscripts hidden by their families or even their masters who wished to increase their robota (corvée) labor. Wenceslaus declared that any family whose son volunteered for the military was released from robota, which led to a surge of rural Czech recruitment and practically ended serfdom in Bohemia. The few remaining serfs were freed during the Regency of Sigismund. The Czech manpower helped Wenceslaus who also hoped that their service would Germanize them, to no avail - the few remaining soldiers after the initial battles served as translators for new recruits. Now the report says that recruitment has dropped down to prewar levels, and worse, training standards have been repeatedly lowered to attempt to bring more men in. Furthermore the Czechs remain bitter at being forced to learn German to communicate with their commanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH22.D;The Reichsarmee has become degraded. The main issue is that most soldiers are Czechs, but most officers are German. Mandatory German lessons have focused only on the most critical military terms, and communication errors have persisted. This in turn drives men to avoid military service, forcing us to slash training standards just to meet our quotas. Three possible solutions have emerged. The simplest measure would be to demand that all units battalion size or above possess dedicated translators, a temporary measure at best that would still leave problems unresolved. The Germans want us to mandate German as the army’s language. The Czechs, Sorbs, and Jews meanwhile would prefer that we organize units along ethnic lines and only assign translators to division leaders and generals. Siding with either group will embitter the other, but without decisive action the military will never be able to modernize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH23.T;The Seventh Imperial Incident : The Salzburg Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH23.D;The Electorate of Salzburg is rife with unrest since the end of the Great German War and the dual sovereignty agreement between the Prince-Archbishop and Bavaria. Many Salzburg inhabitants would prefer the end of Church rule. The Archbishop was forced to sequester himself in the Hohensalzburg fortress after a popular revolt denounced the lack of participation of the Elector in the so-called “German Council” in Munich, alongside heavy taxes and other grievances. However the Austrian and Bavarian governments have accused each other of creating this crisis to bypass the Ewiger Landfriede and gain both the Salzach river valley and a better hand for future negotiations. While guaranteeing the rights of the Archbishop-Elector would strengthen our position, declaring its mediatisation to either Munich or Vienna could also sour relations between both and thus make the planned union of the Danubian princes less likely. §ROf course, if we previously promised to support Austria then betraying them would be unwise…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH24.T;The Ulm Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH24.D;During the Mediatisation, the territorial restructuring of the Empire in the time of Marinus Dahlke’s Imperial Republic, the Free Imperial City of Ulm was awarded to Württemberg. In the subsequent coalition wars, it was annexed by the Electorate of Bavaria. As both powers were among the victors at the Congress of Paris, Ulm was restored under Bavarian supervision to appease the Swabian princes. However this has resulted in both Bavaria and Württemberg seeking to push candidates favorable to their interests for every local office to induce the city to return to them, paralyzing the government. Ever since the last mayoral election ended in a bloody street battle in 1835, we have stationed troops in the city to protect our citizens - and, Württemberg alleges, to enforce our will. Now it seems that Württemberg has struck back, as a recent protest against our continued presence in Ulm escalated to a riot. Pro-Swabian sentiments are increasing in Ulm every day, no doubt fomented by Württemberg. The Jagiellons may be forced to intervene…;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH25.D;During the Mediatisation, the territorial restructuring of the Empire in the time of Dahlke’s Imperial Republic, the Free Imperial City of Ulm was awarded to Württemberg. In subsequent coalition wars, it was annexed by Bavaria. Both powers were among the victors at the Congress of Paris and so Ulm was restored under Bavarian supervision to appease the Swabians. However this turned the city into a focal point of Danubian-Swabian tensions, with both Imperial Estates squabbling over it. Bavaria stationed troops there permanently in 1835, and now a protest demanding said army’s removal has escalated into a riot. The matter is now before the Reichstag, with Württemberg demanding the return of Ulm, Bavaria that they be allowed to sort out the matter themselves (making their annexation of Ulm inevitable), and Ulm that their independence be upheld. §RIf we have previously ruled against Bavaria then this matter will only further embitter them, but if we previously promised to support Austria over Bavaria then betraying them would be unwise.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH26.T;Die Hungerjahre;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH26.D;The Great German War had drastic effects on Germany as a whole. The war increased urbanization along pre-established city centers while leaving the countryside sufficiently desolated. Increasing dependence on Burgundian, Bohemian, and, on a smaller scale, Scandinavian investments, both in the rebuilding of towns and cities led to industrialization at the hands of foreign investors. Meanwhile in the countryside the powers of landlords were strengthened, as they gained more rights to control labor. While serfdom was officially outlawed, the power of the lower aristocracy was stronger than before the Revolution. In most of the countryside, the tenants were forced to rely on potato harvests to feed their family, while growing cash crops for their landlords. In the middle of the 1840 decade, the Empire saw the first ripples of this new economic structure, as a potato blight appeared and the threat of famine loomed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now the looming threat of hunger on a level never before seen has persuaded the members of the Grey League that a unified confederation with Switzerland might allow them to suffer less in the coming years. Therefore a new measure lies before the league’s collective council which would, if passed, petition Switzerland to form a united confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This territorial change requires the consent of the Reichstag, and ultimately of the Emperor. Sigismund is hesitant to permit this due to Switzerland’s strong economic and religious ties to Burgundy - it is feared that an enlarged Switzerland would become a Burgundian playground.

HREBOH32.T;Die Aushöhlung am $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH32.D;This year marks one of the most troublesome times the Empire has faced ever since its foundation. The so-called “potato blight” has consumed most of the empire’s productive farmland, along with a brutal drought. The dominance of the aristocracy in rural affairs was detrimental to the interests of German farmers and workers with agricultural harvests reaching record lows. This was exacerbated with the growth of industry in various urban areas of the empire that induced an internal “exodus” of people leaving the countryside for “greener pastures''. Many liberal and reformist members in the Reichstag now fear that we have reached a “point of no return”, with crippling food shortages on the horizon - a consequence of our inaction on the land matter for decades. This impending catastrophe is akin to the farmers’ ailing at the sight of utterly empty grain stores - the “Hollowing'' or “Die Aushöhlung'' as they coined it. Death’s scythe looms over the Empire, and one thing is certain : §RHistory shall look upon us with distress and contempt.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH45.T;The Tenth Imperial Incident : Panic in Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH45.D;The Black Horseman of Famine is riding through the Empire, as the combination of a severe potato blight and years of aberrant weather conditions have devastated crops all over Germany. Not since the Great Famine of 1315-1317 has Europe seen such a cataclysm. Our subjects are clamoring for support but the weakened and divided state of the Imperial government gives us few options. One of the only things which we might be able to do is force an immediate abolition of serfdom across the Empire by Imperial decree. Serfdom has already been curtailed in some Imperial Estates as well as the Bohemian Crown Lands, so this would not be an unprecedented act. It is hoped that by releasing peasants from obligations to their landlords, we can at least prevent the worst excesses of the nobility by disabling their ability to charge rents or taxes through foodstuffs. Of course the nobles themselves will be infuriated by this unilateral action but their rage matters little if we have no subjects to govern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some say that even human flesh has been consumed. Perhaps Sigismund could have prevented the worst of the famine. But he did not. He drove the Empire to ruin.

HREBOH46.T;The Death of John IV of Münster;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH46.D;Duke Johan IV of Münster was a strange man. He lived in Anvers during the Great German War and upon his return he filled his court with Burgundian intellectuals. He has also had tuberculosis since 1835, and refused any treatment from a German doctor. Last evening he finally passed away. His heir and cousin, Dietrich VI, whose derangement is an open secret and who lacks any political education, now must appoint a new chancellor, a task which might be hijacked by various factions. The “Magdeburg Circle” is popular among the bourgeois of Münster who seek to reconcile us with Prague to integrate the duchy’s economy into the larger Elbian landscape. The “Frisian” faction supports closer integration of Münster into the Protestant Rhineland and thus with Burgundy. A third, tiny fringe interest group is interested solely in self-preservation and wants to exploit the crisis to push for empowerment of the senate in order to eventually abolish the monarchy. All three are now squabbling and the realm under Dietrich’s “leadership” is rudderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH46.A;As if we lacked perils…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH47.T;The Eleventh Imperial Incident : Chaos in Münster;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH47.D;The Duchy of Münster was formed when the Prince-Bishop Franz von Waldeck of Münster converted to Protestantism in the 17th century and was subsequently ennobled in exchange for secularizing his realm. Now the Burgundophile Duke Johan IV has died from tuberculosis. His heir is his mentally ill cousin Dietrich VI, a man with no political education, and thus the realm has fallen into disputes between political factions. The Jagiellon loyalists of the “Magdeburg Circle,” composed of Münster’s bourgeois, have requested immediate aid to suppress the pro-Burgundy “Frisian” faction and the insurgent republicans. While we could in theory scrounge up enough of the Reichsarmee to deploy to Münster, the utter devastation of the Empire would make their deployment a Herculean effort that would occupy resources desperately needed elsewhere. §RIf we had previously promised to respect Burgundy’s presence in the Rhine region then betraying them may be unwise…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOHF47.D;The Duchy of Münster has had a turbulent history, having been formed when the Prince-Bishop Franz von Waldeck of Münster converted to Protestantism in the 17th century and was subsequently ennobled in exchange for secularizing his realm. As a rare pro-Imperial Protestant he was largely left alone, but his heirs have been less shrewd. Now the Burgundophile Duke John IV, who spent the entire Great German War living in Anvers and who filled his court with Burgundians, has died from tuberculosis. His heir is his mentally ill cousin Dietrich VI, a man with no political education, and thus the realm has fallen into disputes between political factions. Now the pro-Burgundian “Frisian” faction and the insurgent republicans have incited violent rebellions against the loyalist bourgeois of the “Magdeburg Circle.” All $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence within the duchy has been eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOHF47.A;Is there no peace to be found anywhere in Germany!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH48.T;The Fate of Münster;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH48.D;It appears that the Emperor has been unable to assist the Magdeburg Circle. Neither civil nor military aid has been delivered to them, and thus the bourgeois of Munster have seen their power shattered by their rivals. The imperial loyalists may have been defeated, but multiple other parties are still contending for supremacy. The “Frisian Group” is the most well-organized, but the defeat of their rivals has encouraged factional splintering amongst themselves. A group of dissatisfied ex-Frisians has formed what they call the “Free Munster Group,” looking to neither Burgundy nor the Emperor but Scandinavia to safeguard Munster from foreign encroachment. The realization that both factions are courting non-German powers has led many people to turn to the republicans to preserve some semblance of Munster’s independence. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH49.T;The Saxon Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH49.D;Germany has been laid low by the cataclysm of famine, but even in the most disastrous of storms, there is always a silver lining. Not just the princes but even the lofty Emperor has suffered as of late, and the Imperial throne is now weaker than ever before. The Ernestine Union of Thuringia, that unnatural imperial project which Sigismund intended to use as a prototype for reorganizing the Empire into his personal dominion, is now vulnerable. With the Emperor enfeebled, the Ewiger Landfriede can be safely ignored. Now is our chance to unite the Saxons! Perhaps such a victory could even serve as a step towards a greater German unity…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH49.A;Our new kingdom awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH50.T;Cracks around the Edges;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH50.D;The Empire is falling apart at the seams. What were once local disagreements between towns and princes now routinely explode into violent clashes. Multiple regions of the empire have begun forming defensive pacts independent of their Imperial obligations - not just against foreign threats, but even against rival princes. Now the Elector of Lüneberg has declared open war against the Ernestine Union of Thuringia to “unite the Saxon people,” an act which would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago. There will be no Reichstag vote on the matter, no deployment of the Reichsarmee to halt the chaos before blood can be spilled. The Ewiger Landfriede is but a memory. The Empire now struggles just to pull itself along from one day to the next : intervention in this matter is impossible. We must guard what little remains of our strength for the coming trials, for surely our weakness has not gone unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH50.B;”Wars, terrible wars, and the Tiber foaming with much blood…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH51.T;The Saxon Brothers’ War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH51.D;All of Germany may be in the grip of the most brutal famine in our history, but even with all of the other animals long since slaughtered, vultures abound. No greater evidence of this can be found than the conduct of  the Electorate of Lüneberg, which has now attacked us in an unprovoked war of aggression! They claim that the “Ernestine Union of Thuringia” is an unnatural state conceived as some sinister tool of Imperial domination, and have set out to “unify the Saxon people” by the sword. The Emperor has grown too weak to protect us any longer through the Ewiger Landfriede : we alone must stand for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH51.A;Zum krieg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH52.T;Burgundian Outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH52.D;We had previously signed a secret treaty with Burgundy, the Reichstadt Convention, in which we bought their support for our reclamation of Pomerania at the Congress of Venice in exchange for giving up on Hungary and permitting Burgundian influence in the Rhine region. For one reason or another we found it necessary to break this treaty. This has infuriated the Burgundians who have decided to cease all pretensions of holding anything but hostility towards the Empire. Today the Burgundian ambassador to the Empire was officially recalled, and relations between Anvers and Prague have just reached their lowest point since the run-up to the Great German War. The Burgundians are now watching us like hawks, waiting for any possible pretext to attack us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH52.A;It was just a scrap of paper…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH53.T;Austrian Outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH53.D;We had previously made an agreement with the Archduchy of Austria to support them in all disputes with their neighbors within the Empire going forwards, chiefly with Bavaria. For one reason or another we found it necessary to break that promise. This has infuriated the Austrians who have publicly revealed the details of our agreement. The backlash against Austria’s involvement has been to an extent drowned out by the mounting fury amongst the Danubian princes, who are enraged that we ever consented to engage in such blatant favoritism and moreover that we did so in secret. None are more irate than Bavaria, Austria’s main rival. Both realms have now expelled all Imperial functionaries and appear to be on the verge of open rebellion against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH53.A;It was just a scrap of paper…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH54.T;Götterdämmerung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH54.D;Ever since the end of the Great German War, the Danubian princes - especially Austria and Bavaria - have chafed at our authority, becoming hotbeds of German nationalism. Now they have gone even further than Lüneberg dared to go. Not content to merely wage war or claim territory within the Empire, they have formed a united Danubian Confederation and announced their independence. Already all Imperial functionaries and troops have been expelled to the crown lands of Bohemia, and all border crossings fortified.\n§RThe hour of the Empire’s destiny is at hand. Accepting this development would mean accepting nothing less than the death of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Ordering general mobilization will draw in foreign powers and plunge the continent into carnage.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH54.A;We have no choice. Prepare the abdication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH54.B;§RTHIS IS TREASON! ORDER GENERAL MOBILIZATION, NOW!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOHF54.T;The End of the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOHF54.D;”Who can bear this disgrace, which weighs down upon a nation which was once so glorious? - may God improve things, if it is still possible to improve them!”\nThe beloved child of Otto the Great has finally expired. The formation of the Danubian Confederation proved what everyone in Europe already knew : the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was dead. Many feared that the Jagiellons would wage one last, desperate war to preserve it, but Sigismund seems to have finally developed a semblance of wisdom. This morning he announced his abdication as Emperor. Few electors seem willing to convene the Reichstag to elect a successor, especially considering that one of them, Bavaria, has already left the Empire. While Sigismund shall continue to rule Bohemia, never again shall he or anyone else wear the Reichskrone. It is the end of almost a millennium of Imperial history, and Europe shall never be the same again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH55.T;The Emperor Proclaims a Reichsexekutionskrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH55.D;The actions of Austria and Bavaria, and their defiance of Imperial authority, can no longer be tolerated. With firm evidence of their insubordination in hand, we have obtained a judgment from the Reichshofrat (Aulic Council), the highest Imperial court, demanding that both Imperial Estates hand over any individuals suspected of treason against the Emperor. Austria and Bavaria will of course never accept, and thus we have compelled the Reichstag to formally declare a Reichsexekutionskrieg against the Danubian princes, authorizing the Reichsarmee to enter their borders and force them to obey. This is a direct violation of Article III of the Treaty of Paris, which disavowed using the Reichsarmee to enforce internal Reichsexekutions. Word of our actions is already spreading in Anvers, Copenhagen, and Paris - in fact we have just received the Anglois ambassador, who has informed us that, due to our breach of the treaty, the Anglois-Imperial alliance is now null and void. The shadow of war is once again falling over Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH55.A;The Empire must be restored, §Rno matter the cost!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH56.T;Terminal Imperial Overextension;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH56.D;Many people, most of all the Chancellor, have repeatedly cautioned Emperor Sigismund V against delving too deeply into the local affairs of the Imperial Estates. Yet he and his followers pressed on, believing in the dream of a true Imperial restoration in defiance of liberalism and German nationalism. It is unfortunate that even emperors have limits. The recent interposition of Prague in an Imperial dispute has taxed the Imperial court’s resources to the breaking point - and beyond. Opposition to Imperial overreach is now at an all time high, as both upper and lower classes denounce the Emperor as a grasping tyrant. §RWorst of all, the Great Powers of Europe are growing to see the threat of a reborn Holy Roman Empire as unacceptable, and, if the reports of our agents in their capitals are true, are beginning to prepare to strike against us…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH56.A;§RThere is no turning back now.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH57.D;”Remember that you are a chosen people! Today I know neither German nor Czech, only blessed subjects of our most Holy Empire! The spirit of the Lord has descended upon me. I am the instrument of the Most High. I am His sword, His representative. Woe and death to all those who resist my will! Woe and death to those who do not believe in my mission! Woe and death to the cowards! Let them perish, all the enemies of the Imperial people! God demands their destruction - God who, through my mouth, commands you to execute His will.” - Emperor Sigismund V\n\nWe have completely broken the Treaty of Paris, and now the guns of Europe are turning upon us. General mobilization has been declared throughout the Crown Lands of Bohemia and all Imperial realms still loyal to Prague. The condition of the whole nation is that of a great armed camp, tense and waiting for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH58.T;The Coming Storm over Anvers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH58.D;”Soldiers of Burgundy! We place our faith in you. It is your valour which makes this possible, for your heroic determination shall be the indispensable condition to our success. Upon it depends our future victory. Upon the vast theatre of Europe, thanks to you, there exists a situation out of which will spring the definite triumph of our cause. We make one more appeal to your courage, your ardour, your spirit of sacrifice, your love of country. Go forth and strive with all your might to shatter the desperate efforts of an enemy already in disorder.” - Crown Prince Jean\n\nThe Jagiellons have scorned the Treaty of Paris and are preparing to wage war on all dissident Imperial princes, something we cannot allow. General mobilization has been declared throughout the Kingdom of Burgundy. A delegation has already left for Scandinavia to affirm our alliance, and a flying column has been marshaled to occupy Oldenburg to secure our flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH58.A;A spear, hefted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH580.T;The Coming Storm over Oldenburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH580.D;”We have a proper sense of our duty, and the means to carry it out. We have mapped our own course and we intend to keep to it. Ours is a policy of enlightenment and progress, not of darkness and reversion. From this moment on, we and our allies are fighting for our national existence. I do not for a moment believe that any man will hesitate to step forward and, with a heart filled with courage, join the ranks of our defenders.” - Duke Albrecht I\nThe Emperor has disavowed the Treaty of Paris and is preparing to attack all “dissident” princes within the Empire to reunify it under his rule, something that we cannot accept. But we do not fight alone. This morning a Burgundian army arrived in the capital to support our nation against the tyrant Sigismund. Though many Oldenburgers protest that the Burgundians have come as occupiers, not protectors, our Duke welcomes their aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH59.T;The Coming Storm over Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH59.D;“Let us realize that we are fighting as a united realm in a cause worthy of the highest traditions of our people. Let us recall the memories of the great men and deeds of the past, commemorated in the monuments of our cities. Let us recall the last triumphant words of General Sven af Mannerheim, who said, after his victory in Holstein : ‘Scandinavia has saved herself by her exertions and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.’ Our nation gave a noble answer to his appeal, and did not sheathe the sword until the freedom of Europe was secured. Let us go and do likewise.” - Prime Minister Joel Olsen\n\nThe Jagiellons have disavowed the Treaty of Paris and are preparing to attack all dissident princes of the Empire to reunify it under their control. We cannot permit this! General mobilization has been declared throughout the United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, as we make ready to once again march south against the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH59.A;...and a hammer, lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH60.T;The Coming Storm over Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH60.D;The signs are unmistakable : The European mood has turned from passive opposition of the Emperor’s attempts to reunify and centralize the Empire to active hostility. Not since the days of Dahlke’s revolutionary dictatorship has despair so continuously stalked the streets and fields of our nation. While we could cling to neutrality, we would be at the mercy of whichever power prevails in the coming struggle. Thus if we want to arbitrate our own destiny then we must cast our lot either with the Emperor, or with his enemies, led by the Kingdom of Burgundy and the United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland. If the Emperor prevails, then our autonomy shall surely be forfeit as the Empire is consolidated back into the unified state of the past. If the Emperor fails, then…well, who knows what will happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH60.A;God forgive us, but the Burgundians are our only hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH60.B;Burgundy may protect us but our hearts lie with Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH61.D;”I look on myself as an instrument of the Almighty and go on my way regardless of transient opinions and views…In the present social confusion, it may come about that I order you to shoot down your own relatives, brothers or parents but even then you must follow my orders without a murmur. There is only one person who is master in this Empire and I am not going to tolerate any other.” - Emperor Sigismund V\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, Marinus Dahlke seized the Holy Roman Empire and proclaimed an Imperial Republic. No sooner had Europe felled him than Emperor Wenceslaus V took up the cause of Imperial unification, but he, too, fell. Now his son, Sigismund V, has ignited a new, awful and terrible war to finish what his father started. As the first shots ring out across the Danube, crowned heads from Londres to Copenhagen tremble at the realization that the maw of Hell has once again opened to devour a new generation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH62.T;A New Reichskrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH62.D;We were told that the Great German War was a unique cataclysm. We were told that the Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of Venice would inaugurate a new era of international peace and brotherhood. We were lied to. Germany is once again awash in a sea of blood, with the Emperor on one side and Burgundy and Scandinavia on the other. Naturally, the foreigners pose the greatest threat to us - if they are victorious then Germans shall be slaves to alien masters forever. As such the Reichstag has voted to declare a Reichskrieg, a state of war encompassing the whole Empire and which requires all its constituent states to fight beneath the Imperial banner against the enemy. Therefore it is with heavy hearts that we must once again take up the sword in service to the Emperor of the German Nation, and place our forces at his disposal…unless there might be a way to take advantage of this crisis?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH62.A;Der Reichskrieg ist unser krieg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH63.D;Although we are standing against a new coalition of enemies the likes of which has not been seen since Wenceslaus V’s reign, we may take comfort in the knowledge that there remain loyal princes within the Empire. The Reichstag recently voted to declare an official Reichskrieg against our enemies, a formal state of war across the Empire requiring all of its constituent states to supply forces for the Reichsarmee. This morning Crown Prince Rupprecht II of Saxony arrived in Prague at the head of the Saxon royal guard to take his place within the Reichsarmee, and confirmed that all Saxon forces are at the Emperor’s disposal. As the call to arms goes out across the Empire, we can only hope that other states shall show as much fidelity as the Saxons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH63.A;Thank God for Saxony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH64.T;A New Reichskrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH64.D;We were told that the Great German War was a unique cataclysm. We were told that the Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of Venice would inaugurate a new era of international peace and brotherhood. We were lied to. Germany is once again awash in a sea of blood, with the Emperor on one side and Burgundy and Scandinavia on the other. Naturally, the Emperor poses the greatest threat to us - his victory would reduce us to a mere province within a centralized Empire. While the Reichstag has voted to declare a Reichskrieg against Burgundy and Scandinavia, a formal Empire-wide state of war which theoretically obligates all member states to consolidate within the Reichsarmee, we need not obey. As a matter of fact, it is within our interests to let Burgundy and Scandinavia’s forces pass through our realm on their way to battle. Better their men fight and die than our own, after all - §Respecially given that, since we are so hostile to Imperial power, a victory by the Emperor would not be in our interests.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Reichsarmee was ground into dust by the invaders and now all of Germany is in disarray. In fulfillment of the terms of the Treaty of Anvers, the Lands of the Crown of Bohemia are under joint Burgundian-Scandinavian occupation, Sigismund V has abdicated as Emperor, and the Reichstag was convened for a final time - not to elect a successor, but to vote to permanently dissolve the Holy Roman Empire. May God have mercy on the German people tomorrow, for today He has cast them into darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH66.D;”They sent forth men to battle, but no such men return : And home, to claim their welcome, come ashes in an urn.” - Aeschlyus, ‘Agamemnon’\n\nThe Second Great German War has raged across the heart of Europe, but it has come to nothing. Neither Emperor Sigismund V nor his enemies in Burgundy and Scandinavia could prevail over the other. Both sides have now recognized this stalemate and have met in Londres to establish peace terms. While in theory neither side made concessions, there was never any doubt what the consequences of failure would be for Sigismund. With a republican revolution by the outraged people of Bohemia imminent, he chose to abdicate as Emperor. The Reichstag shows no sign of being convened to elect a successor, and therefore the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation has been the final casualty of the worst war of our era. It is the end of almost a millennium of Imperial history and Europe shall never be the same again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HREBOH67.D;”Pacem sine dubio post haec, verum cruentam.” - Tacitus, ‘Annals’\n\nThe Second Great German War has ended in the complete resurrection of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Europe, indeed the entire world, is still reeling from the shock of Emperor Sigismund V’s overwhelming victory against the anti-Imperial coalition led by Burgundy and Scandinavia. In a lavish ceremony in Prague, all of the princes and bishops of the Empire, as well as the rulers of Burgundy and Scandinavia, paid homage to Sigismund and confirmed his status as the undisputed sovereign of the Holy Roman Empire. His Holiness the Pope personally appointed Sigismund Knight of the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest honor which the Papacy can bestow, and even the Anglois monarch was in attendance, awestruck (or perturbed) by the festivities. It is the restoration of a truly united Empire after over six hundred years, and Europe will never be the same again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Reichskrone has been deposited in the former Imperial Museum in Prague, never again to be worn, and the various Imperial states, from the tiniest Free Cities to the vast Lands of the Crown of Bohemia, have been left to determine their own destiny.

As cheering crowds across Burgundy celebrate the conclusion of hostilities, the more farsighted ministers ponder the future of Europe.

As tales of horrific carnage across the heart of Europe make their way to our headlines, we are left to ponder the future of Europe. The end of the Empire leaves an unprecedented vacuum of power in Germany, one which the victorious powers shall no doubt seek to fill.

HREBOH76.D;It has been almost six hundred years since the Holy Roman Empire was unified - ignoring Wenceslaus V’s experiment - but in its prime it was the undisputed greatest power of Europe. Now that era does not feel so remote, as Emperor Sigismund V has done what both Marinus Dahlke and his father Wenceslaus V could not, curtailing the autonomy of all Imperial Estates and centralizing the Empire into a true nation-state. We have been the historical friends of the Jagiellons, but the so-called “Renovatio Imperii” has destroyed the balance of power in Europe. Where, our ministers speculate, will the reborn Empire’s ambitions end? Their frontiers once stretched as far west as the Rhône River and as far south as the Papal States, after all. Even Marinus Dahlke claimed the entire Kingdom of Burgundy!

HREBOH77.T;The Collapse of the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH77.D;Emperor Sigismund V has made many enemies in life, but the one that finally did him in was the one which he suspected the least - his own subjects. This morning a protest regarding the high cost of bread in Prague was attacked by royal guards when it came too close to the Imperial Palace, sparking a citywide riot. The chaos was fueled by general unrest elsewhere in the Bohemian crown lands, until the whole city was occupied by revolutionaries, who proclaimed a new Republic of Bohemia and Moravia. No mercy was shown to the autocratic Emperor, who was Damoclined in front of the Church of St. Nikolaus, whose keystone had been placed by his own great-grandfather, Sigismund IV. The Empire has thus been thrown into a second Interregnum, as Burgundy and Scandinavia have both exploited the crisis to occupy vast swathes of the realm rather than allow the Reichstag to elect a successor. The future of Germany is now cloudier than ever, but one thing is certain : it will not involve the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH77.A;Death to tyranny! Freedom for the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH78.T;The Prague Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HREBOH78.D;A series of liberal demonstrations in Prague, inspired by ongoing unrest elsewhere in Bohemia, culminated in a “fraternal mass,” a quasi-religious demonstration by reformists angered at the government’s inaction. The Mass, attended by a patriotic retired priest, did not disperse after concluding, but instead turned into a protest march. When soldiers attempted to block them from approaching the Imperial Palace, a struggle erupted that escalated into a riot. Rural reservists who had been called up to defend the capital instead joined the protestors, allowing them to surround the palace. Sigismund and his personal guards then engaged in a tense standoff with the liberals, ending in a compromise whereby he granted a moderate, “mixed” constitution in exchange for his life and his throne. The document guarantees new civil rights for the people and empowers the Bohemian Land Diet but still preserves multiple aspects of the monarch’s authority, a compromise that pleases nobody but which has prevented further violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF1.T;The Archduchy of Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF1.D;Many Austrians believe that their archduchy has been dealt a terrible hand in recent history: Siding with the losing factions during the Great German War three times and surrendering to their political archnemesis Bavaria and Bohemia during the Congress of Paris in 1820, Austria has been dismantled to its crownlands. The House of Habsburg-Ravensberg is now stuck in an identity crisis: Isolated by geography and diplomacy, its influence upon the other Danubian states is limited, though a large percentage of the population, inspired by Dahlke's victory against the Wittelsbachs, take pride in their perceived German heritage. Nonetheless, a significant minority of Protestant Slovenes and Germans in the Duchy of Carinthia rally around the emerging ideals of self-determination against Catholic Vienna or even Munich in the future. Now, the current Archduke, Joseph II, whose succession was more of an unplanned blunder than an expected outcome, will have to lead Austria out of its current misery, and maybe even to greater heights...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF2.T;News from Klagenfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF2.D;The March of Carinthia was formed in 889 by King Carloman of the ancient kingdom of Bavaria, granted to his son Arnulf, and was raised to a duchy in 976. Though the composition of the Empire has shifted massively since then, Carinthia’s estrangement from the rest of Germany has not. The lower Carinthian nobility, many of them Protestant Germanized Slovenes, have historically exercised great autonomy. Furthermore, many of Carinthia’s larger settlements lie south of the Alps, increasing their separation. The years since the Great German War have seen an embryonic Slovenian nationalism begin to coalesce, and the Landtag has begun to reflect this Slovene ascendancy. Now a printer in Klagenfurt has taken to printing a newspaper in the Slovenian language, the first of its kind and one which may set off a domino chain of Slovenian cultural revivalism. §RIf we have not addressed the Carinthian situation before pursuing any form of German unification then this problem may come to a head.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF3.D;Previous Archduke Charles IV's unwillingness to properly govern the archduchy resulted in several revolts against his rule in Rhenish Ravensberg and Carinthia shortly before the Great German War. When Charles IV died, a succession struggle ensued since he left no surviving direct male heirs, though after a bloodless "coup" his only male grandson Joseph II who initially wasn't intended to rule Austria in the first place gained the crown with the support of the savvy Chancellor Erwin-Adalbert of Sigmaringen. Thus, the surviving daughter Maria Leopoldina and two other elder granddaughters Maria Louise and Clementina were completely overlooked, especially Maria Louise who was old enough at the time to properly rule the archduchy. Maria Louise was later married to a Bavarian prince, who now stands to inherit the Duchy because of the lack of offspring of Wilhelm IV while Clementina defied the Vienna Court by marrying Georg Khevenhüller, a prominent Carinthian noble and converted to Protestantism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF3.A;A house divided…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF4.T;The Dreams of Joseph II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF4.D;Archduke Joseph II watched the unification of Ducal Saxony with considerable interest. It is well known within the royal court that Joseph, like most Austrians, is wary of Bavarian ambitions to claim hegemony over the Germans of the Danube. While some have spoken in baleful terms of a coming apocalyptic struggle between the two powers, Joseph has a different vision in mind. While he agrees that the unification of the Danube is more or less inevitable, he believes that Austria can still preserve her honor and dignity through decentralization. The crux of his ideas lies in the Danubian Circle, the Imperial administrative region encompassing both Austria and Bavaria. These Imperial Circles have been used for centuries to coordinate mutual defense, taxation, and representation in the Reichstag and the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court). While they do in theory each have a common legislature, the Circle Diets, they have never been seen as nations in their own right. But they very well could serve as the model for one…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF4.A;Is it time for a Danubian confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF5.T;Stanislaw, King of Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF5.D;Stanislaw von Habsburg, a relative of our own Archduke, has recently been elected king of Poland and thus lord of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth following the death of his father, Maximilian III. Since the middle of the 18th century, a branch of our dynasty has been living in Poland, and the election of Stanislaw confirms the prestige of our esteemed and venerable house. Joseph II was quick to send him his congratulations, and plan for a marriage between the Austrian branch and the Polish one are underway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF5.A;The House of Habsburg grows ever greater!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF6.T;Stanislaw Exiled to Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF6.D;Since the middle of the 18th century, a branch of our dynasty has been living in Poland, its most prominent scion being Stanislaw von Habsburg. Today we learned that Stanislaw has been accused of treason against the Polish crown, and was forced to flee the country! He was put forth as a candidate at a Sejm to elect a new monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a few years ago, but failed to receive sufficient votes. Now a group of liberal revolutionaries were just recently arrested in Warsaw, and under questioning revealed that they had planned to kill the current king and coronate Stanislaw in his stead. Stanislaw was forced to go into exile in order to escape a trial for high crimes against the Polish Crown. Rather than travel to his dynasty’s homeland, he fled east to the realm of Moscow, possibly to court Russian aid to claim the Polish crown. While many of our relatives do not believe the charges against him, for now he has become a black sheep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF6.A;What an embarrasment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF7.T;Stanislaw the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF7.D;King Stanislaw of Poland has won a great triumph! We have been following his exploits since his coronation, and he has astounded Europe by rescuing the Commonwealth from destruction more than once during his reign. Fighting off both predatory nobles and foreign attacks, he has revitalized and reunited his realm, ensuring the survival of the Commonwealth for generations to come. The prestige of the House of Habsburg has soared to new heights, and if nothing else then our dynasty shall be remembered as the saviors of the Polish people. Perhaps one day Joseph II will rise to match the fame of his relative - perhaps one day, he too shall bring unity to his people. But for now, let us prepare a feast in Stanislaw’s honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF7.A;May Poland never forget the heroism of the House of Habsburg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF8.T;The Downfall of Stanislaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF8.D;King Stanislaw of Poland recently attempted to execute an ambitious plan to eliminate both the political power of the nobility and the influence of foreign powers like Scandinavia and the Holy Roman Empire. This entailed imposing drastic reforms upon the Commonwealth and plunging the realm into a brutal and destructive war with multiple neighboring powers. It is now clear that Stanislaw’s ambitions were larger than his talents. The Commonwealth has suffered a dramatic defeat. Its lands have been partitioned, his reforms undone, and Stanislaw, overwhelmed with grief, has destroyed himself in the most literal sense. His failure is a stain on the House of Habsburg, and none of the peoples once counted within the Commonwealth will ever forgive or forget our dynasty and the role which it played in their downfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF8.A;Let us not speak of this henceforth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF9.T;Passau Black Market;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF9.D;Passau was burned twice in the last century. The city's renovation was paid by the Bavarian duke with the local magnate, Bishop Eberhard II of Passau, effectively laundering the money to use it for the city's reconstruction. Nonetheless, Passau was mediatized to Austria during the Great German War and it is the only gain which we kept in the Treaty of Paris. Yet most of the citizens of Passau would have preferred joining the Bavarian Electorate, where most of their trade is done. While we are keeping an eye on the community, so far actual separatism is not an issue according to the local authorities. What has emerged instead is a thriving underground market where illicit goods change hands, particularly radical liberal and pan-German literature printed in Bavaria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF9.A;One must make a living somehow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF10.T;The Electorate of Bavaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF10.D;Bavaria in recent years has become the envy of the various states of the Holy Roman Empire : It remains the only true victor of the Great German Wars, evident by the lack of large-scale destruction of the electorate and its expansion to include the former Princely County of Tyrol in 1814 among other territories, confirmed in the Congress of Paris of 1820. Guided by two popular dukes in a row, namely Duke Maximilian "Max" IV "the Great" von Wittelsbach, whose exceptionally long reign between 1798 and 1832 was marked by the ascendancy of Bavaria in the Danubian Circle, and his only surviving son William "Willy" IV, who is ruling Bavaria since 1832. Bavaria is still defining its ambitions in Germany and its future is unclear : The impotence of His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector is an open secret, though his young age of only 31 gives him plenty of time to shape the destiny of Bavaria. That is, of course, unless the vast array of political leaders and ideologues which the electorate of Bavaria houses force him into another direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF10.A;Heil unserm Herzog Willy, Heil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF11.T;The Constitutional Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF11.D;Munich has become a hub of intellectuals and political refugees from across Germany, but this has in turn emboldened their reactionary enemies, causing political polarization to rise across Bavaria. If we are to survive the rising tide of political turmoil threatening to once again sweep over Europe, then we shall have to renovate our legal system to satisfy the desires of the people. Thus Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV has tasked his jurists and ministers with drafting a new constitution. This will be a slow and careful process as we must consider its implications for the future of our nation. §dCome what may, a royal edict will be proclaimed to enact the constitution around 1843. The more public support which we offer to either parliamentarians or absolutists, the more that their influence will be manifested in the edict.§ §RFailure to heed the call of reform could have dire consequences.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF11.A;We must face the future together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF12.T;Der Karlsbad Tag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF12.D;A meeting of Bavarian reactionaries and Great German War veterans has been held in the spa city of Karlsbad, Bohemia. This was no vacation, but rather an informal gathering of noted monarchist and conservative figures from across Bavaria, who felt more comfortable in the Imperial crownlands than in their own, politically polarized country. While no minutes were kept of the meeting, a summary of the conclusions of the “Karlsbad Tag,” which they seek to publish, has been obtained by agents of the crown. This manifesto calls for the suppression of liberalism and German nationalism within Bavaria, equating it to the murderous tyranny of Marinus Dahlke’s Imperial Republic. We have the right to either withhold approval for its distribution, or to demand that the royal censors redact the most indelicate parts, which the liberals would certainly appreciate. Openly siding against so many influential Bavarians, especially men who have shed blood in her name, will of course not enhance the Duke-Elector’s popularity with the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF12.A;§RProhibit the manifesto from publication!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF12.B;§dCensor the inflammatory sections and then publish it.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF12.C;§hPublish their manifesto in full.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF120.T;The Innsbruck Festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF120.D;Inspired by the 1836 Karlsbader Tag, liberals have held their own meeting in Innsbruck under the guise of an “apolitical” county fair which drew thousands of attendees. Many participants were university students or others of similar age, animated by notions of democracy and German nationalism. The former held far greater importance at the Innsbruck assembly, which eventually decided to focus on advocating for the new Bavarian constitution to guarantee a strong, elected Landtag and universal suffrage. The wording of their public statements and proclamations is such that we could arrest their leaders for treason, but doing so might inflame liberal agitation across Bavaria. We could also try to co-opt their more moderate elements and steer them away from republicanism by endorsing the meeting, but this would horrify conservatives. Of course we could always simply place their leaders under police surveillance and publicly ignore the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF120.A;§hImprison them for high treason!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF120.B;§dA commendable initiative!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF120.C;§RWatch them. Closely.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF13.T;The Trial of ‘Das junge Deutschland’ Twelve;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF13.D;Some liberals were angered by the Innsbruck Festival’s focus on Bavaria over Germany at large. These radicals formed “Das junge Deutschland,” or “Young Germany,” a political club that has since spread across the Empire. It advocates for a single, revolutionary democratic republic “as far as the German tongue sounds, from Holland to Prussia.” It is unclear if all supposed chapters are in fact part of the same organization, but they are much feared by reactionaries. Recently their loyalists in Bavaria committed several robberies to secure funds, and were then arrested in Regensburg, where plans to overthrow the Bavarian government were found. Now a dozen men - some younger than eighteen - are facing decades of prison time. Most of the defendants had minor roles in the group. Liberals are protesting for their release, alleging that the evidence against them is dubious. Even moderates argue that while a handful of them may be guilty, they do not all deserve such harsh punishments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF13.A;§RPardon all of them.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF13.B;§dPardon those without real proof of guilt.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF13.C;§hCriminals get what criminals deserve!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF14.T;The Ducal Pamphlet of 1840;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF14.D;The Ducal Pamphlet is a yearly tradition by which the Duke-Elector of Bavaria can speak directly to his subjects regarding issues of note for the realm. While once a rather symbolic affair, the growth of political turmoil in Bavaria has seen it taken on new emphasis as a window into the minds of the royal court and the administration at large. Years ending in a zero are traditionally broader in scope, reflecting on the past and future rather than addressing recent events or current matters. His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector and his advisors are now drafting the Ducal Pamphlet of 1840, and he is trying to choose a tone for his writing. The safest choice would be a simple appeal to peace and brotherhood, but this could be written off as empty prose. He could also take a more political approach ; either side with the reactionaries, asserting the power of the Crown and recalling the sacrifices of the Great German War, or side with the liberals by promising reform while avoiding specifics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF14.A;§dAppeal to peace and to the brotherhood of all Bavarians.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF15.T;Street Violence in Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF15.D;Liberal public meetings, while legal, have increasingly been targeted by reactionaries. In response, reformists began organizing elaborate banquets to cover their gatherings. Now a banquet held at the home of wealthy liberal lawyer Arnold Rapp has sparked something far more dangerous. The banquet attracted an unprecedented number of guests, frightening the chief of the Munich city guard into dispatching policemen to investigate whether it might be a staging ground for a revolt. Residents of Munich awoke in the night to the sounds of street clashes between city guards and liberal students and activists. In the aftermath, legal representatives from both sides - including Rapp himself - are suing one another, and the government is expected to take action. The military has urged the Duke-Elector to suspend freedom of assembly, Rapp has implied that he would urge his colleagues to drop their cases if negotiations with the Crown and the police were arranged, and many liberals have called for more restrictions on the Munich city guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF15.A;§hFreedom of assembly was a mistake. Annul it.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF15.B;§dMeet the leaders of both parties for negotiations.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF15.C;§RReprimand the chief and tighten police regulations in the city.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF16.T;Religion in Bavaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF16.D;Bavaria weathered the Protestant Reformation without any new sect taking hold in the realm over the long term. While once regarded as a shining beacon of the Catholic faith in Germany, the recent influx of political refugees, the growth of liberalism, and the rise of Reform Judaism bringing more Jewish Bavarians into the political sphere has called the legal place of the Church within the Electorate into question. Conservatives are adamant that Catholicism is so fundamental to our identity that it must be preserved. Liberals take the opposite view, arguing that it is precisely this devotion to religious dogma which is holding Bavaria back from progress and prosperity. Pan-German nationalists in particular, who see Ashkenazi Jews as fellow Germans and denounce reactionary anti-Semitism, are troubled by the thought of a Bavarian-led Germany with a state religion. If we are to set the state on a sound legal footing then we must adopt a definitive attitude towards religion - one that may be the foundation for nations yet to be born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF16.A;§RBavaria will be a state for all Germans regardless of their religion.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF16.B;§dAll other faiths remain tolerated but Catholicism is our state religion.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF16.C;§hTo abandon the holy Church would be like scorning our own mother.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF17.T;The All-German Council in Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF17.D;The Burning of Nuremberg and the subsequent dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth is proof that Emperor Sigismund V will stop at nothing to finish what his despotic father Wenceslaus V started and centralize the Empire. At the same time, German nationalism has now reached a fever pitch amongst the people of the Empire, threatening to plunge us all into anarchy. To address both crises, Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV has invited all of the princes and bishops of the Empire to meet at the Royal Opera House in Munich and discuss the future of Germany. The goal of the council will be to determine how the Imperial Estates themselves, rather than the Empire or revolutionaries, can build a new system for Germany given the clear dysfunction of the present one. Our priority is to convince Austria, our old rival, to put aside ancient grudges and unite the Danubian Circle, the Imperial administrative region comprising our two states, into one country. If a smaller union state can survive, then we could expand the model to encompass all of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF17.A;Germania shall burst her bonds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF19.T;The First Council of the States of Germany in Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF19.D;The First Council of the States of Germany, held in Munich in $YEAR$, was convened by Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV von Wittelsbach of Bavaria to address both the resurgence of Imperial authority and the growth of German nationalism. While broader points such as tariffs and border controls were discussed, the main conclusion was that the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation had failed to protect the Imperial Estates from threats both foreign and domestic. This signaled the greatest lack of confidence in the Emperor by the Imperial Princes since the Wars of Religion, and that pan-German nationalism had become entrenched among even the upper classes. All eyes were on Wilhelm and his supposed rival, Archduke Joseph II von Habsburg of Austria. The two spent a surprising amount of time talking with one another, discussing plans to further ties within the Danubian Circle, the Imperial administrative unit encompassing our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF21.T;Riots in Salzburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF21.D;The Electorate of Salzburg is rife with unrest since the end of the Great German War and the dual sovereignty agreement between the Prince-Archbishop and Bavaria. Many Salzburg inhabitants would prefer the end of Church rule. The Archbishop was recently forced to sequester himself in the Hohensalzburg fortress after a popular revolt denounced the lack of participation of the Elector in the German Council in Munich, alongside heavy taxes and other grievances. However, the Bavarian cabinet believes that this is a plot by Austria to gain the valleys of the Salzach and a better hand for future negotiations. Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV himself is apprehensive. He does not want to seem weak in the eyes of the Bavarian nobility at a time when their confidence in his actions is required, but angering the Austrians could jeopardize negotiations. The matter has now been brought before the Reichstag and the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF23.T;The Reichstag Rules in Favor of Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF23.D;The Salzburg situation was ultimately brought before the Reichstag, where the emperor openly supported Austria against us. The resulting deliberations have resulted in the Electorate of Salzburg being mediatised to Austria. The loss of Salzburg has embittered Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV and the Bavarian population at large, who now feel that the crisis was an Austrian ploy from the very beginning and that the Austrians attended the German Council in bad faith. All discourse between the Austrians and ourselves have ceased, and relations between us have once again become strained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF23.A;All for one damned principality…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF24.T;The Expansion of the Dual Status Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF24.D;The lack of intervention in the Salzburg dispute by the Jagiellons forced us to resolve the matter with Austria ourselves in bilateral negotiations. The resulting agreement has expanded the Electorate of Salzburg’s dual status arrangement to include Austria as well. To signify the new agreement, Wilhelm IV and Joseph II both went to the city to calm the citizens, with the two princes signing a joint proclamation granting the Salzburgers amnesty for their revolt. The Archbishop then departed Hohensalzburg Fortress and reentered the city, whereupon he met with both the Archduke and the Duke-Elector to discuss the role which Salzburg would have in future negotiations between Austria and Bavaria. This agreement might create further conflicts in the future but it has prevented an immediate breach between ourselves and Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF27.T;The First Council of the States of Germany Closes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF27.D;The First Council of the States of Germany in Munich ended today, but the repercussions are already echoing across Europe. For the first time since the days of Marinus Dahlke’s Imperial Republic, the notion of a unified German nation without the Reichskrone has returned. Princes, intellectuals, and even the common people across Germany are now discussing ideas of pan-nationalism which just a decade ago were the domain of only the most radical of revolutionaries. The fate of Austria and Bavaria is of particular importance, as these states have become locuses of pan-nationalist fervor. The support of Archduke Joseph II von Habsburg of Austria for a union of the Germans of the Danube Circle, potentially as a stepping stone for a new German nation-state, has been an open secret for years. The next step of German unity will likely be taken in our own homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF27.A;We are the heralds of the German dawn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF28.T;The Reichstag Rules in Favor of Bavaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF28.D;The Ulm situation was brought before the Reichstag, and it has been decided that we shall be allowed to proceed with our handling of the affair. Emperor Sigismund V personally intervened to thwart any attempt by Württemberg or her supporters from pushing for their own control over Ulm. He may well have had his own reasons for doing so, but regardless Ulm is now in our hands. A hastily arranged referendum, along with just a little bit of electoral tampering, has ensured that Ulm’s annexation into Bavaria has been accomplished without excessive struggle. Württemberg is of course infuriated by this turn of events and Austria is apprehensive at our growth but our consolidation of the Danube has progressed nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF28.A;Ulm belongs to Bavaria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF280.T;The Annexation of Ulm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF280.D;It has become clear that the Jagiellons are in no position to intervene within the Ulm situation. Therefore, we can present Württemberg with a fait accompli. A hastily arranged referendum, along with just a little bit of electoral tampering, has ensured that Ulm’s annexation into Bavaria has been accomplished without excessive struggle. Wurttemberg is of course infuriated by this turn of events and Austria is apprehensive at our growth but our consolidation of the Danube has progressed nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF29.T;The Reichstag is Unable to Resolve the Ulm Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF29.D;Despite several rounds of deliberation, the Reichstag has not arrived at a decision regarding the ongoing situation in Ulm. Much of this can be blamed upon Emperor Sigismund V, who, rather than rule in favor of either Württemberg or ourselves, has instead worked to prevent either side from rallying enough support to enforce their agenda. Although he has spoken of the need to “preserve the Empire’s territorial integrity,” most Bavarians - especially Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV - feel that this is a direct effort by the Emperor to keep his own Imperial Estates divided. We have been forced to drop the matter for the foreseeable future, and Ulm shall remain independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF29.A;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF30.T;The Reichstag Rules in Favor of Württemberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF30.D;The Ulm situation was brought before the Reichstag, and it has been decided that we shall be allowed to annex it. Emperor Sigismund V personally intervened to thwart any attempt by Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV of Bavaria or his supporters from pushing for his own control over Ulm. The Emperor may well have had his own reasons for doing so, but regardless Ulm is now in our hands. Bavarian forces have been forced to withdraw, and the city has been proclaimed the latest territory of our duchy. Bavaria is of course infuriated by this turn of events but our consolidation of the Swabian lands have progressed nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Emperor Sigismund V personally intervened to thwart any attempt by Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV or his supporters from advancing his own claim to the city. The Emperor may well have had his own reasons for doing so, but regardless Bavarian forces have been forced to withdraw, and the city is now lost. Our failure to assert control over Ulm - almost exclusively due to the Emperor’s intervention - has inflamed the nation even further. Liberals have declared that the crisis is evidence of the monarchy’s weakness, while conservatives have instead cited the incident as a consequence of the liberals’ own attacks upon the Electorate’s political foundations. The situation has provoked the Duke-Elector into finalizing the draft our our new constitution and preparing for its immediate publication to stabilize the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF31.A;This is just a minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bavarian forces have been forced to withdraw, and the city is now lost. Our failure to assert control over both Salzburg and Ulm, both due to Imperial interference, has destabilized the nation. Liberals of all types have decried the Wittelsbach monarchy as a fetter upon the Bavarian nation, and radicals are now calling for the establishment of a republic! The situation has provoked the Duke-Elector into finalizing the draft our our new constitution and preparing for its immediate publication to restore stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF32.A;We must persevere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF33.T;The Electoral Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF33.D;After years of consultation and labor by the Duke-Elector and his staff, the constitutional proclamation is ready. In this document is infused not merely the efforts of a collection of individuals, but the fate and the future of Bavaria. Crowds flock to Munich for a chance to witness the most historic event of their generation, flooding the streets surrounding the Imperial Palace. At noon sharp, the Duke-Elector appears at the front balcony of the palace, and begins to read…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF33.A;Well? What is he saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF34.T;The Affirmation of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF34.D;”...The person of the Duke-Elector is sacred, inviolable, and domestically sovereign in responsibility. The Duke-Elector makes war or peace. Throughout the realm, justice is administered in the name of the Duke-Elector…”\nThe new “constitution” of the Electorate of Bavaria is not really a constitution at all. It has not advanced any new rights for the people, and in fact has curtailed political liberties to a degree not seen since the eighteenth century. When the assembled crowd began to grow unruly at this revelation, they were dispersed - not by the Munich city guard, but by the ducal Bavarian army. Liberal organizations across Bavaria have gone back underground, and the mood of the nation has dramatically soured. Some have made dark comparisons to the days of 1790, on the eve of the Imperial Revolution...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF34.A;This was the only way to preserve public order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF35.T;A Limited Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF35.D;”We Wilhelm the Fourth, by God's grace, Duke and Elector of Bavaria, et cetera, et cetera, according to the urgent demands of public welfare, taking into account as possible those of the representatives of the people extensive preparatory work to issue the following constitutional document have decided, subject to the revision of the same in the final proper legislative routes. We therefore announce the constitution for the Bavarian state as follows…”\nThe new constitution has addressed the major demands of the liberals. Ducal power has been weakened and the Landtag empowered, but the nobility-aligned House of Councillors has been given the bulk of legislative power rather than the more open House of Representatives. Liberals remain dissatisfied but a significant amount of Bavarians are simply relieved that the monarch is willing to listen to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF35.A;Progress, nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF36.T;The People’s Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF36.D;”Bavarians are equal before the law, whatever may be their titles and ranks. They contribute, without distinction, in proportion to their fortunes, towards the expenses of the state. They are all equally admissible to civil and military employment. Their personal liberty is likewise guaranteed - no one can be prosecuted or arrested save in the cases provided by law and in the form which it prescribes. Everyone may profess his religion with equal freedom…The legislative power is exercised collectively by the Duke and Elector, and the Landtag, comprised of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives…”\nThe Duke-Elector has surrendered almost all of his authority. The legislature has been empowered, universal male suffrage granted, censorship abolished - even independent trade unions are now legal! Needless to say the Empire is aghast at this sudden liberal resurgence, and we have effectively become a pariah state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF36.A;But, my God, how the people cheered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF37.T;Major Protests in Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF37.D;Liberal anger at the shortcomings of the new constitution ran far deeper than the Duke-Elector or his ministers had believed. People who once considered themselves to be moderates and reformists are now gravitating towards republicanism, believing that the monarchy will never voluntarily devolve the entirety of its authority onto a democratic government. Across Bavaria, rumors are circulating of secret societies being formed by attendees of the Innsbruck Festival, societies whose goal is to lay the grounds for a republican revolution. Munich has been hit particularly hard by republican unrest, with regular protests in the city streets bringing day-to-day business to a halt. §RThe only reason that the violence might de-escalate is that the more moderate liberals wish to put their grievances aside in the name of pan-German nationalism. If German unification turns out to not address their problems, then liberal agitation may return with a vengeance.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF37.A;We must watch ourselves around the liberals going forwards…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF38.T;The Passau Meeting, or the Second German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF38.D;Following the end of the Council of the Nations of Germany in Munich and the Salzburg crisis that followed, the Bavarian and Austrian governments agreed on a future meeting in Passau, a city both important to the Archduke and the Duke-Elector. Expectations are high on both sides, even though many wonder what the Austrians will think of the Electoral Proclamation and the events that followed. While romanticists have described this prospective summit as a “Second German Council,” it is in truth a more bilateral affair between ourselves. Yet its importance still cannot be understated : success here may open the way for the peaceful unification of our states within a joint confederation. §REven if we succeed, the Jagiellons will not be pleased by the formation of a nationalist state on their border. But, the plight of Germany demands action!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF40.T;Failure of the Second German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF40.D;Bavaria has become astonishingly liberal since the First German Council, a fact that went neither unnoticed nor unremarked upon by the Austrian delegation. In fact the new Bavarian government - and the conditions which it attempted to put forth for the unification of the Danube - proved to be totally unreasonable. Much of the Austrian entourage has already departed for Vienna, and it is likely that Passau will stand as a monument to yet another failure by the pan-German nationalist movement. It is rumored that our head of state is planning to personally meet with his opposite Austrian number in the name of German unity. If this rumor is false then the only option to unite the Danubian Circle may be through iron and blood - if true, then the German people may yet snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF40.A;Our collective fatherland hangs in the balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF41.T;Negotiations Proceed in Passau;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF41.D;We have maintained stability in the Danubian Circle since the First German Council, a fact positively remarked upon by the Austrian delegation. So far it seems that both of our nations have recognized our common ground in the name of building German unity and resisting both the Jagiellons and foreign powers such as Burgundy and Scandinavia. However all the good will in the world cannot determine whether or not the Austrians will accept our proposal for unification within a single confederation. Now we can only try our best to convince them of the honesty of our intentions, and that the benefits of unity outweigh the risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF41.A;Austria, Germany’s hope is in your hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF42.T;The Bavarian Plea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF42.D;The Bavarian head of state has made an appearance at the temporary residence of our own leader in Passau. There the two men engaged in a passionate conversation regarding Austria, Bavaria, the Danube region, and Germany at large. The thrust of his argument is that German unity is so important that we both must moderate our negotiating positions and accept that neither Austria or Bavaria will be able to completely arbitrate the future constitution of our prospective confederation. He has expressed empathy with Austria’s unique political position and culture, and sworn that the Bavarians desire an equal, equitable, and fair system, “just as your people, just as all of the German people, do.” Eventually, our head of state stood up from his chair, and said…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF42.A;§R”Even in the face of Armageddon, I shall never compromise.”§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF42.B;§d”Sir, henceforth I shall call you my friend and my brother!”§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF43.T;Negotiations in Nassau Come to a Head;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF43.D;We have now largely determined the prospective constitution of the unified Danubian nation which we seek to construct. If adopted, it would establish a confederation reserving significant powers to local governments, but still placing essential powers of legislation in the hands of the confederal legislature. The mood amongst the whole Austrian delegation is that we have reached the point of no return. If we do not withdraw from negotiations now then we will be committing ourselves to unification with Bavaria. Given that the prospective confederation would be a stepping stone to the consolidation of all of Germany, we would also face a Reichsexekution - an official Imperial judgment by the Imperial Aulic Council, the highest court in the Empire, against us. And though the Treaty of Paris ostensibly forbids it, we could even face a Reichsexekutionkrieg, a sanctioned war by the Emperor against us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF43.A;§REnough! This was madness from the beginning! Withdraw at once!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF43.B;§hOne people we shall be, one band of brothers!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF44.T;Failure of the Second German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF44.D;The governments and desires of Austria and Bavaria have proved irreconcilable. To the horror of pan-German nationalists everywhere, the meeting in Passau has ended in failure, with both of our delegations departing with nothing to show for their efforts except for bitterness. However, the collapse of the council by no means marks the end of pro-unification sentiment. If anything, it has cemented it in the minds of the Austrian and the Bavarian people. The difference is that, now, the unity of both the Danubian Circle and of Germany is spoken of in darker tones, in tones of iron and blood, of manifest destiny. §RA military confrontation between Austria and Bavaria is now inevitable.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF44.A;The Bavarians have nobody to blame but themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF440.T;Failure of the Second German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF440.D;The Austrian government has steadfastly refused to make any political compromises for the sake of German unity, demanding instead that our government realign towards their own regime. Therefore we have been left with no choice but to depart from Passau in anger and plan our next move. One way or another, the people of the Danubian Circle must be united. We had hoped that this could be done through diplomacy, but the failure of our negotiations means that only force shall be able to settle the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF440.A;We must look for an opportunity…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF45.T;Success of the Second German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF45.D;The day long awaited by pan-German nationalists everywhere is closer than ever, as Austria and Bavaria concluded a series of negotiations in Passau resulting in the groundwork for the unification of the Danubian Circle under a confederal structure. Both nations have agreed to create a united government which will oversee matters such as foreign policy, taxation, and infrastructure development, and the transformation of the Danubian Circle Diet into a proper national Landtag. The formation of a “Danubian Confederation,” a country which may very well be the cornerstone of a future German nation-state, is no longer a theoretical possibility, but instead an imminent reality. For the first time since the days of Marinus Dahlke, a new power may soon arise within the Empire itself to challenge the Jagiellons for the destiny of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF45.A;The German people are standing up at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF46.T;The Second Salzburg Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF46.D;Our rule in Salzburg has become unstable. Despite the annexation of the principality, liberal revolutionaries began to regroup. They have demanded either the adoption of a constitution so radical that it would end the monarch’s influence in politics, or the outright abolition of the monarchy. After a recent Mass in which the Archbishop of Salzburg severely criticized the liberal movement, a protest occurred outside of St. Peter’s Abbey during a meeting of Salzburg religious authorities. The Archbishop summoned the city guards, but this time several revolutionaries in the crowd came armed and engaged in a shootout with the police, with several priests caught in the crossfire. In the aftermath, guns seized from the rebels were found to be of Austrian manufacture! The military insists that this is proof of Austrian sponsorship of the ongoing liberal agitation. We must assume the worst, and prepare for immediate confrontation with Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF48.D;With the recent tensions in both Bavaria and Austria, liberal revolutionaries have flocked to Salzburg, spreading their rhetoric and demanding either massive reform or outright republican revolution.

After a recent Mass in which the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg lambasted the liberal movement, a protest occurred outside of the Residenz palace during a meeting of Salzburger religious authorities. Before the Prince-Archbishop could summon the city guards, several revolutionaries - who, having learned from past street battles, came armed - overpowered the local security and let the crowd into the Residenz. The Prince-Archbishop was soon lynched in front of his own palace and the rest of the clergy have been imprisoned within the Hohensalzburg Fortress, while revolutionaries have declared a new republican city-state. Both Austrian and Bavarian authorities have accused one another of supporting the rebels, and a confrontation between our nations over the Salzburg crisis is now imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not : Am I my brother's keeper? And He said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.” - Genesis 4 : 8-10\n\nAustria and Bavaria have long been regarded as the greatest hope for German unification, but only on the condition of learning to overcome their differences. That has now become impossible. Both powers have accused each other of fomenting unrest in the disputed city of Salzburg, and today both the Austrian and the Bavarian armies attempted to occupy it. This led to a skirmish that has spiraled into a full-blown war. At stake is not merely the right to unify the Danubian Circle, but the prime candidacy for uniting Germany. One shall stand, one shall fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF51.A;Bayern, Bayern über alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF52.T;Der Donau Bruderkrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF52.D;The recent unrest in Salzburg forced us to take action. We had deployed a division of the Austrian Army to occupy the city and put down the liberal insurrection, but Bavaria had the same idea. Our forces engaged in a running battle throughout the city streets, and now we have been drawn into a direct confrontation with the Bavarians! The time has come to fight, not simply for the fate of Austria, but for the fate of the people of the Danube, and for Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That state is already on unsteady footing, as we prepare to absorb a resentful Bavarian population who will not soon forget the circumstances by which we struck their nation from the map of Europe. The city of Ulm, which chafed under Bavaria and has even less loyalty to ourselves, has wasted no time in taking advantage of the chaos to secede to Wurtemberg. Far more pressing, however, is the threat of retaliation from Emperor Sigismund V. Therefore we cannot spend any time smoothing over the last details.

They failed on both counts. Austria has forced Bavaria into submission and established a united Danubian Confederation. In a proclamation from Vienna, the Austrian head of state declared the unification of the Danubian Circle, before making an even more shocking announcement : the immediate secession of the Confederation from the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The Danubian German state of today may become the unified German state of tomorrow - if it survives Prague’s wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF560.D;The conflict between Bavaria and Austria has exhausted both sides who have been unable to dominate the Danubian river valley. At this point there seems to be no end to our conflict and this lack of resolution is not unnoticed by Prague. We cannot allow foreign intervention to destroy us, not when we are so close to realizing our mutual destiny! Therefore an armistice has been negotiated pending further discussions of peace terms. A meeting is planned in Salzburg between the leaders of Austria and Bavaria to determine the terms by which we can end this fratricidal bloodshed. Upon them is pinned not merely the hope of the Danubians but of Germans everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF57.D;”You ask which form of government is the best? Whichever teaches us to govern ourselves.” - Ludwig von Goethe\n\nThe so-called “Bruderkrieg” between Austria and Bavaria has ground to a standstill. Now, in an ironic twist of fate, the leaders of both Bavaria and Austria have met on the famous bridge over the Salzach built by Anglois funds to celebrate a meeting between the Bohemian King and the King of France and England in Salzburg. There the two Danubians have publicly shaken hands to end their fratricidal war and put their differences aside in the name of the German cause. A new Danubian Confederation, with its capital in Salzburg to accommodate both Bavaria and Austria, has been born today. In a most daring move, the President of the Confederation, the Archbishop of Salzburg, in accord with each of its member states, has proclaimed that all territories of the Confederation renounce all allegiance to the Emperor in Prague.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF58.T;The Petition from Klagenfurst;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF58.D;Over the last few years, Slovenian nationalism has coalesced behind a push to make the Landtag more reflective of the population and curtail the power of the German (including the Germanized Slovene) nobility. It was hoped that we could circumvent the Carinthian issue through German nationalism. However, the prospect of becoming a minority in a pan-German (and possibly even officially Catholic) state has sent alarm bells ringing throughout Carinthia, and this fear has manifested in the Landtag. Now a group of notable Carinthian Slovene politicians have arrived in the capital to present a request for a conference between Austrian and Carinthian officials to arrive at what they call an Ausgleich, or “Compromise.” It is feared that the Carinthians will demand significant cultural and political protections as a condition for supporting the unification of the Danube, but all things considered this is a rather polite request and refusal could cause Carinthian separatism and Slovenian nationalism to merge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF58.A;Absolutely not! The mere suggestion is treasonous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF58.B;We’ll meet them, they came in peace after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF59.T;The Carinthian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF59.D;Our refusal to negotiate with the Carinthian Landtag confirmed the worst fears of Slovenian nationalists. They have become obsessed with the idea that we will reduce them to an internal colony and suppress their cultural and religious identity. A call to action was recently published in the Slovenian newspaper Celovški casi (Klagenfurt Times) by Protestant priest and Slovenian nationalist Father Aleksandar Kozler, and this morning he gave an inflammatory sermon in which he called upon the Slovenes of Carinthia to rise up against “the German Babylon.” The result was a mass mutiny of ethnic Slovenian soldiers in the Carinthian militia, who arrested their own German officers and then converged on the Carinthian capital to swear loyalty to Kozler! He has now been proclaimed the provisional president of a republican regime, and declared full independence from both Austria and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF59.A;Carinthia was, is, and will be GERMAN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF60.T;The Ausgleich Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF60.D;The conference between Austrian and Carinthian politicians, the latter headed by Carinthian politician Peter Miklosich, has been convened. After multiple rounds of heated negotiations, where we were able to convince the Carinthians that independence was off the table, it appears that they want one of two concessions : either autonomy, or the disavowal by Vienna of pan-German projects. The Carinthians have absolutely refused to accept any sort of internal status within a future pan-German state that would not allow their own Landtag to legislate matters within Carinthia. Many of our own politicians believe that these negotiations are a waste of time, though a handful of isolationists have raised the point that a pan-German state could very well subsume the Austrian identity as well. Therefore, they say, the idea of abandoning Danubian unification is not unthinkable. Bavaria would of course be infuriated if we abandon them now for the sake of Carinthia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF60.A;We must accept the compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF60.B;The Carinthians are right, Austria should remain Austrian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF60.C;This was a waste of time! A few Slavs cannot stop the German destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF61.T;The Austrian Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF61.D;Discord reigns in Munich, as we have received news that Austria has terminated their involvement in the unification of the Danubian Circle. It seems that a wave of isolationist sentiment swept Vienna after a conference with representatives from the Austrian-controlled Duchy of Carinthia, who had pleaded with the Austrians to protect their autonomy. Few had expected Austria to go so far as to abandon pan-Germanism just to maintain control over Carinthia. As difficult as it is to believe, if we wish to press ahead with unification, then force may be our only remaining option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF61.A;What were they thinking!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF62.T;The Ausgleich of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF62.D;Negotiations in Vienna have been successful. While we were unable to press for full independence from Austria, we have forced the Austrians into granting and guaranteeing our autonomy no matter what sort of pan-German state they participate in going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF62.A;A victory nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF63.T;The Salzburg Meeting, or the Third German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF63.D;We are on the precipice of forming a united Danubian state with Austria, but several matters remain to be ironed out. The location of the capital, the matter of the head of state, and most importantly, the prospect of war with Emperor Sigismund V upon the formation of our confederation, all require further discussion. However, some members of our cabinet have raised a fourth possible issue : the situation of Carinthia relative to Austria. Carinthia enjoys a complex arrangement of privileges dating back to the Middle Ages and many of us are still unclear as to how this will function under a new pan-German state. Therefore we have arranged a third and hopefully final meeting in Salzburg between our government and that of Austria to put these matters to rest and prepare for the imminent unification of the Danubian Circle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF63.A;Glory is within our reach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Furthermore, some members of our cabinet believe that Munich has caught wind of brewing trouble with the Carinthians. While we had hoped to keep the matter off the table until after unification had been settled, we must not allow the Carinthians to force a more public confrontation with our government. Therefore a meeting has been arranged with the Bavarian government in Salzburg to finalize the terms of the unification of the Danubian Circle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF64.A;Let’s hope that they don’t mention it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF65.T;The Carinthian Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF65.D;The “Third German Council,” as romanticists have dramatically referred to it, has immediately run into the issue of Carinthia.The Austrians repeatedly refused to elaborate on the matter, saying only that it was irrelevant. We were forced to send an agent to Klagenfurt, where he obtained several German- and Slovene-language newspapers on recent disputes between Vienna and the Carinthian Landtag. He brought this evidence back to Salzburg, where the Austrian delegation, confronted with irrefutable evidence of the crisis, finally confessed that Carinthia is fearful of losing its cultural and religious identity. They therefore had petitioned Austria for independence, which was denied, before negotiations became bogged down and collapsed. The Austrians have warned us that they do not want to reopen the issue but the Carinthians are distressed by the prospect of German unification and could resort to force if they feel that their needs will not be addressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF65.A;We must attempt mediation to solve this crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF66.T;Bavaria Proposes to Mediate the Carinthian Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF66.D;At the Salzburg meeting, Bavaria repeatedly inquired into Carinthia, and our delegation tried to avoid the matter. Unfortunately, the Bavarians went so far as to procure several German- and Slovene-language newspapers discussing ongoing disputes between our government and the Carinthian Landtag, forcing us to elaborate on the autonomy question. The Bavarians have been sympathetic to our desire to keep matters calm on the eve of unification, but have insisted that if the matter is not addressed, Carinthia may become destabilized and could even rise up in revolt. Therefore they have proposed to convene a joint Austro-Bavaro-Carinthian council to mediate the matter. It is likely that the Bavarians will eventually propose a modified form of the original autonomy agreement, which will still prevent us from fully incorporating Carinthia. §RHowever if we refuse then it would amount to forsaking Danubian unification.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF66.A;They may try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF66.B;§RNEIN! WAS FÄLLT IHNEN EIN!? DAS IST EMPÖREND!§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF67.T;Collapse of the Third German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF67.D;Bavaria’s underhanded actions to attempt to force us to cave in to the Carinthian separatists were too offensive for us to tolerate. This must have been a sign of things to come, of Bavaria seeking to pit the peoples of a prospective pan-German state against one another for their own ends! We shall have no part in it. Our delegation has already departed Salzburg. Let this be a lesson for those who attempt to dictate terms to the Austrian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF67.A;We will not be pawns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF68.T;Failure of the Third German Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF68.D;The Austrians absolutely refused to entertain any discussion of Carinthia. To the horror of pan-German nationalists everywhere, they went so far as to abandon the meeting entirely in protest of our “interference.” However, the collapse of the council by no means marks the end of pro-unification sentiment. If anything, it has cemented it in the minds of the Austrian and the Bavarian people. The difference is that, now, the unity of both the Danubian Circle and of Germany is spoken of in darker tones, in tones of iron and blood, of manifest destiny. §RA military confrontation between Austria and Bavaria is now inevitable.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF68.A;The Austrian mind is ruled by hatred of others and love of themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF69.T;The Carinthian Mediation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF69.D;An agreement has been reached with the Carinthians. They will fully support German unification and will allow the prospective confederal government to have authority over their foreign and military policy, in exchange for the Carinthian Landtag being given the power to pass domestic legislation and control taxes within Carinthia. The Austrians remain bitter at the lost opportunity to curtail Carinthia’s autonomy, but the threat of an upcoming Carinthian uprising has for the moment been dealt with. §dThis agreement will not fully come into effect until unification is complete.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF69.A;A compromise is better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF70.T;The Question of the Capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF70.D;We are on the verge of unifying the Danubian Circle, but one last pressing question remains - the location of the capital. No matter how much we stress the equality of the confederal system, whichever city is made the capital of the confederation will inevitably allow that region to exert special influence upon the rest of the country. As we have taken a leading role in the negotiations and in advancing pan-German nationalism in general, Munich is the natural candidate. We could put forth Vienna instead, but at this point doing so would be seen as forfeiting our leadership of the German cause. Whatever we decide, it is clear that a Danubian Confederation shall soon be born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF70.A;Munich shall be the new heart of the German people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Following the negotiations, Wilhelm IV von Wittelsbach was elected President and Munich was chosen as the permanent capital of the Federation. However the gentleman’s agreement between Willy and Archduke Joseph promised the Habsburg the position of leader in 5 years, helping quell the dissensions between the two Danubian foremost princes. This system has been heavily criticized by the radicals who see it as a reactionary system to preserve the power of the aristocracy, but moderates see it as the best model to further German Unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Taking inspiration from the Fürstlichkonferenz of Ducal Saxony, the Konferenz der Bundesherrscher, consisting of the head of states of each federal member,  elects the President of the Federation every 5 years from candidates of the hereditary heads of states. Following the Salzburg agreement that ended the Austro-Bavarian war, Johan von Thun, Archbishop of Salzburg was elected President and Salzburg ended up as the permanent capital of the Federation. This interim election was meant to avoid further dissensions between Munich and VIenna but tensions have hardly calmed down. Johan as archbishop is demonized by the radicals who see his rule as the proof of the reactionary nature of the Federation and he is hardly supported by the houses of Wittelsbach and Habsburg who are already plotting for the next election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF78.T;The Habsburg Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF78.D;The War with Bavaria has seen the victory of the House of Habsburg, with Joseph II forming the Danubian Federation in the aftermath. Ruling as the hereditary President of the Federation, Joseph II can now rebuild the Danubian Plain as he wishes. Many in the private council urge him to end the interim governments in Tyrol and Bavaria and crown himself Count of Tyrol and Duke of Bavaria : this will show the rest of the German princes that Germany will be united around the house of Habsburg, by force if needed. More moderate figures urge him to build a true Federal State which will not be seen as an Habsburg ploy but a true German Federation. The Leopoldian-Tyrol cadet branch of the Habsburg house ruled Tyrol until 1814 and Franz-Joseph could easily placed back in Innsbruck while numerous Wittelsbach princes could easily be manipulated to further Austrian interests in Bavaria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF78.B;A true Federation, to heal the wounds of the Bruderkrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF79.T;The return of the Tyrol-Habsburgs in Innsbruck;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF79.D;Following the plans drafted by Joseph II, his distant cousin, Franz-Joseph von Habsburg, direct heir of the last prince-count of Tyrol, Ferdinand IV who had been deposed by the Bavarian army in the Great German Wars because of his support of Wenceslaus has come back to Innsbruck. The county had been annexed formally in 1814 and confirmed during the Treaty of Paris but Tyroleans remained staunch legitimists with several revolts and general discontent toward Bavarian authorities. At least, that’s the narrative Franz-Joseph has decided to push forward to his speech from the Innsbruck from the balcony of the Hofburg, accompanied by the Federal President Joseph II of Austria. Already Tyrol seems to see the Federation as not just the instrument of the Vienna Court but also a promise of better times and the resentment against Vienna is rapidly fading in the Alps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF79.A;We have freed Tyrol from Bavarian occupation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF80.T;The Bavarian inheritance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF80.D;With the Tyrol issue dealt with, the Bavarian interim was the next issue to deal with. Wilhelm IV of Bavaria did not have any children, and the succession was always quite clear with his nephew, prince Ludwig, designated Crown Prince of the Wittelsbach demesne before the war. However Ludwig had been married to Maria-Louise von Habsburg, one of the Austrian heirs that Joseph II had bypassed when he accessed the throne, and thus the Vienna circle fears that if they are allowed on the Bavarian throne, the power of Joseph II be challenged within the Federation. The other solution is to crown Joseph Duke of Bavaria and have Munich ruled by Bavarian elites in personal union with Austria. This action would strengthen Joseph II's position in Germany but also embolden the opponents to Austrian rule who had hoped Bavaria would regain a true Duke following the Tyrol example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF80.A;Crown Ludwig as Duke of Bavaria and let the wounds heal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF80.B;Crown Joseph as Duke of Bavaria, for the unity of the German nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF81.T;The Wittelsbach Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF81.D;The War with Austria has seen the victory of the House of Wittelsbach, with Wilhelm IV forming the Danubian Federation in the aftermath. Ruling as the hereditary President of the Federation, Willy can now rebuild the Danubian Plain as he wishes. Many in the private council urge him to end the interim governments in Carinthia and Austria by crowning himself Duke of Carinthia and Archduke of Austria : this will show the rest of the German princes that Germany will be united around the house of Wittelsbach, by force if needed. More moderate figures urge him to build a true Federal State which will not be seen as a Bavarian ploy but a true German Federation. Recent developments in Carinthia around the bypassed heiress Clementina has strengthened the idea of having a different ruler from VIenna and there are also potential successors for Vienna that Bavaria could manipulate to further the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF82.T;The Enthroning of Clementina I of Carinthia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF82.D;Clementina von Habsburg was the second eldest grand-daughter of Charles IV of Austria by his first son Ferdinand, but she was denied the succession by the Vienna Court and saw her cousin Joseph II ascend instead of her sister. In an act of defiance against Vienna she later married Georg Khevenhüller, a prominent Carinthian noble and converted to Protestantism becoming the champion of the Carinthians in Austria. Thanks to an arrangement with Wilhelm IV of Bavaria, Carinthia has been definitely separated from Austria and Clementina has become Duchess, establishing her court in Klagenfurt where she and her husband were crowned in the presence of the President of the Federation. Because of the troubles between Klagenfurt and Vienna because of the religious divide alongside the language issue between the Slovenes and the Germans, the news of the separation with Austria has been met with joy throughout the Duchy and their integration within the Federation is already a success by all reports!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF82.A;Let Carinthia flourish without Vienna’s interference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF83.T;The Austrian Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF83.D;Contrary to Carinthia, Austrian succession is another problem. Joseph II has gone into exile following his defeat, but his wife has stayed in Vienna to clamor for the rights of their son Ferdinand and has appealed to Wilhelm IV and her cousin-in-law Maria-Louise directly to champion her cause. However the Munich court has also entertained the idea of supporting the claim of Maria-Louise, the eldest granddaughter of Charles IV, who is married to Ludwig of Bavaria, nephew and presumed heir of Wilhelm IV. Like Clementina, her claim is strong but this would likely be seen by Austrians as a power grab by Bavarians hoping to later unify the Archduchy with the Duchy in a few decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF83.A;Maria Louise will rule as Regent for her nephew Ferdinand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF83.B;Maria Louise will become Archduchess and Ludwig Archduke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF84.T;Demonstrations in Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF84.D;The failure of the new Bavarian constitution to address the demands of the liberals has been a known fact for some time, but we had assumed that their anger had burned itself out. We thought wrong - they were biding their time, waiting for an opportune moment to strike. The spread of new notions of militant, radical republicanism has caused Munich to catch fire with liberal agitation, as all of the grievances of the past are recalled, and multiplied by the fear that the government will use the confederation’s consolidation to silence demands for political rights. The prospect of a future German nation-state built not on the principles of egalitarianism and democracy but instead on monarchism and tradition has outraged those who now realize that the Danubian Confederation will not necessarily lead to the end of monarchism in Germany, but may in fact protect it. Ongoing protests in Munich have demanded that the government either introduce comprehensive reforms to return power to the people…or step aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF84.A;This mood will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF85.T;Demonstrations Spread to Vienna!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF85.D;The unrest in the Danubian Confederation continues to mount. Protests have also broken out in Vienna, revolving around similar liberal and republican rhetoric. The two revolutionary strains appear to be merging, with the republicans taking the lead in the current discourse. Martial law has been declared across the nation, but multiple officers have remarked with concern that the rank-and-file troops are some of the most sympathetic to radical rhetoric. If enough of the army mutinies and joins the protestors, then it could spark a revolution which we would be unable to oppose. The current unrest means that the confederal Landtag cannot be convened due to the risk to the legislators’ lives, rendering us unable to ratify any reforms to calm the masses. Something is going to give.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF85.A;How could the people betray us, after all we’ve done for them!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF86.T;The Danubian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF86.D;The rulers of the Danubian Confederation assumed that unification of the Danube would be enough to quiet liberal demands. Instead the opposite occurred - it exposed just how many political issues went unsolved by unification. A group of liberals led a crowd to the Landtag to seize it and vote in a new, radical constitution to abolish the monarchy and form a radical republican federation. There they were met by soldiers, and a tense standoff ensued. However, their commander, Harold Merkel, recognized a close personal friend in the crowd and abandoned his post to join him. His men followed, and the rebels stormed both the Landtag and the royal palace. After the monarch was executed by Fallschwertmaschine in front of the Landtag, the revolutionary leaders appeared at its balcony and asked the crowd to “vote” on the new constitution, and the people roared their approval. Europe watches in horror as their worst fears are realized - a revolutionary pan-German republic has arisen like a phoenix, and Marinus Dahlke is young again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF87.T;The Danubian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF87.D;It had been assumed that the Danubian Federation’s democracy would satisfy the liberals. Instead it exposed just how many political issues the mainstream parties refused to address. After members of more than one liberal party joined with conservatives to block yet another radical republican bill, the radicals staged a walkout from the Landtag. Word spread of a massive rally to be held at Innsbruck, site of the famous liberal festival. Fearing rebellion, an army was sent to keep watch, but when the order was received from the capital to form a security cordon around the thousands of demonstrators, the officers led their men straight to the ringleaders and swore fealty to them “in the name of a free and united Germany!” The radicals returned to the capital in triumph at the head of a new army, quickly seizing it and proclaiming a new, neo-Dahlkist regime. Europe watches in horror as their worst fears are realized - a revolutionary pan-German republic has arisen like a phoenix, and Marinus Dahlke is young again.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SGF88.T;A Transalpine Pact with the Danubians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF88.D;Tensions have been building amongst $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationalists regarding the eastern Alps, which they see as our natural frontier. It was feared that this might lead us into conflict with the Danubian Germans of the north, yet now the Danubian ambassador has approached us to propose a treaty. Its terms state that if $COUNTRY$ forms an alliance with the Danubians, then they shall transfer the Italian city of Trent and its surrounding environs to us in ten years, if we maintain the alliance. The latter term shall for reasons of political necessity remain secret. While the proposal also stipulates that we would be compelled to disavow the old Tridentine claim to the Tyrolean cities of Bolzano and Bressanone, this may be our best chance of solving the Alpine border dispute without force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF88.A;In the name of peace, we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF88.B;In the name of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor, we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF89.T;The Transalpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF89.D;The eastern Alpine border between the German and Italian peoples has been in contention since the days when both groups were still part of the Holy Roman Empire. It was feared that nationalists from both $FROM_COUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$ would provoke war over the disputed Tyrol region, yet instead these powers have found common ground. They have formed a military alliance, pledging not only mutual defense but to join one another in “maintaining security in Central Europe.” Rumors are swirling that some provisions of the treaty have been withheld from publication, which would explain why two nations with seemingly opposite territorial goals became allies in such a short time. Regardless the Danubians have once again shifted the balance of power in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF89.A;Shoulder to shoulder, marching together into the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF90.T;$FROM_COUNTRY$ has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF90.D;It seems that nationalist sentiment has prevailed in $FROM_COUNTRY$ as they have refused our offer of a trans-Alpine pact or to disavow Trent’s old northern territorial claims. This is a clear statement of intent and we should make ready for conflict in the Tyrol with them in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF90.A;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF91.T;The Fulfillment of the Transalpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF91.D;Ten years ago we met with Italian representatives to come to a peaceful solution regarding the Tyrol. The resulting treaty formed a military alliance between us but also secretly promised the city of Trent and its surroundings to our southern neighbors if the alliance was maintained for at least a decade. They have honored the terms and now we should expect them to demand Trent before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF91.A;Very well…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF92.T;The Fulfillment of the Transalpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF92.D;Ten years ago we met with Danubian representatives to come to a peaceful solution regarding the Tyrol. The resulting treaty formed a military alliance between us but also secretly promised the city of Trentino and its surroundings to our southern neighbors if the alliance was maintained for at least a decade. We have honored the terms and now it is time to demand that the Germans honor their own side of the treaty and cede Trentino to us. If they dare to refuse then we shall take…appropriate measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF92.A;We deserve Trentino!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF93.T;The $FROM_ADJ$ Demand Trent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF93.D;As expected, the $FROM_ADJ$ ambassador has delivered a note to our government this morning reminding us of the terms of the Transalpine Pact and demanding the immediate turnover of Trent to $FROM_COUNTRY$. As we were the ones to propose this arrangement it would reflect poorly on our international reputation to refuse, not to mention giving $FROM_COUNTRY$ more than enough of a justification to declare war upon us. On the other hand, Trent IS a valuable city, the gateway between Italy and Germany, and one with a notable Danubian population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF93.A;We must honor the terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF93.B;After all, why not? §RWhy shouldn’t I keep it? My PRECIOUS…!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF94.T;The Tyrolean Border Treaty of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF94.D;Foreign suspicions of secret provisions of the Transalpine Pact were correct, it seems. This morning representatives from both sides of the eastern Alps met in Trent to mark the official handover of the city from Danubian control and the public delineation of the two nations’ resulting Alpine borders. All German-speaking citizens of the area have been offered to either exchange their citizenship for that of their new ruler or move to Danubian lands. While Danubian reactionaries are outraged by this voluntary reduction of the Danubian sphere of influence, Italians are quite pleased by the recovery of Trentino, and the Danubian government has shown itself to be truly magnanimous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF94.A;May the Italian and German peoples prosper together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF95.T;The Danubian Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF95.D;We had made an agreement with the Danubians in good faith to recover Trentino. However when the time came to transfer the city to our control, they refused! All sorts of excuses were made for this backstab but none bear repeating. This is now a question of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor! We must avenge ourselves upon them and liberate Trentino, and perhaps all of Alto Adige, from their illegitimate rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF95.A;As expected of tyrannical German savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF96.T;Annulment of the Transalpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF96.D;The recent shifts in the political landscape of Danubia and northeastern Italy have invalidated the Transalpine Pact. Therefore there is no longer any reason for us not to annex Trent and assume full control over the city and its surroundings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF96.A;Make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF100.T;The Collapse of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF100.D;We have entered a period of irreversible decline. Whether through total political paralysis, catastrophic military defeat, or the loss of a critical population center, $COUNTRY$ no longer has legs to stand upon. The German people have lost faith in our leadership, and the once-united front of pan-German nationalists is splintering into countless rival groups. Even our own provincial governors are drawing away from the capital, gathering their own authority in anticipation of a national collapse which their actions shall surely hasten. §RThis is the end of $COUNTRY$.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF100.A;Failure demands punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LMAOSGF1.T;The Restoration of the Danubian Circle;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LMAOSGF1.D;The formation of a truly unified Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation has sounded the death knell of our government. With Prague restored to full power, they have sent us an ultimatum demanding the immediate restoration of "full Imperial authority over the Danubian Circle." As the rest of Europe has recognized their legitimacy we have no means to resist that would not be suicidal gestures. This is the end of the Danubian experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Let it be known that I am disposed towards the peoples of the Danube with a heart filled with mercy. I shall at once bring this occupation to a close and raise up the ancient realms which once ruled in the lands taken by the criminal rebellion. It is my earnest hope that when next I receive the Archduke of Austria and the Duke of Bavaria, it shall be in conditions of eternal peace.” - Emperor Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

renovate_munich_desc;Munich was the crown jewel of Bavaria ever since the reunification of the Duchy, with each monarch adding new buildings and monuments to the heart of Bavaria.

If the city-state was seized by a pan-Italian power then they could leverage these claims against us. Let us instead propose a treaty to our southern neighbors : if they form a military alliance with us, and waive Trent’s northern claims, then we shall secretly agree to cede Trent to them in ten years, assuming that the alliance is maintained for a full decade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH1.T;Bohemia’s Uncertain Future;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH1.D;With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, our country now finds itself in an awkward position. Unlike the other members of the former empire, our country was never fully German, and the only thing that seemed to tie the various peoples of our country together was the Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. With the loss of the Crown, many in our lands question if our country will hold together, and some are even plotting to try and break the country apart along ethnic lines. The future of Bohemia is in dire straits and a balance will have to be struck to ensure that all sides are placated. If we are unsuccessful then Bohemia may find itself consigned to the ash heap of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH1.A;We exist and shall work to persist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH2.T;The Establishment of the Bohemian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH2.D;”We have therefore resolved, after mature reflection, to assume and to establish for us and for our successors and forever tie the unalterable possession of our lands, and states under the title and dignity of Hereditary Emperor of Bohemia.” - Sigismund I’s Proclamation of the Bohemian Empire\n\nIn order to better bind the lands of our country, Karl von Schwarzenberg has arranged for Sigismund to take on a new royal title that will now supersede his other titles. This title of Emperor or, more accurately, Kaiser is directly modeled on the old Holy Roman Emperor and should serve as a unifying force for our various subjects. As this is a new title Sigismund has also been crowned Sigismund I to illustrate the break from the old Empire. The only threat to this plan would be Sigismund’s tendencies, however after everything that has happened we hope that Sigismund has grown wiser and more reserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH2.A;Gott erhalte Sigismund den Kaiser!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH3.T;The Bohemian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH3.D;It has become clear that the autocracy of the Emperor has only been a destabilizing force, especially with the rise in liberal sentiment. In order to placate these groups a new constitution has been personally crafted by Karl von Schwarzenberg and promulgated over Sigismund’s reservations. This constitution limits the power of the Emperor and grants free and open elections to propertied adult men. Von Schwarzenberg for his part has been naturally selected to lead this new government and will serve in this position so long as he has the Emperor’s grace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH3.A;A constitution guarantees stability, at least…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH4.T;Our Influence in Southern Germany Collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH4.D;Another effect from the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire that we should have expected was the weakening of our influence in Germany. However, it seems that the South German states have taken this opportunity to completely break relations with us leaving the region open to exploitation by other powers. In order to salvage whatever influence Bohemia still had in Germany, Schwarzenberg has been sending letters and diplomats all throughout the Elbian German states. So far it looks as though Schwarzenberg has been successful and the Elbian states appear willingly to remain by our side. Nevertheless our diplomatic situation is dire and it will be a challenge to keep our sphere of influence together, let alone expand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH4.A;The south is lost, but the north still holds promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH5.T;The Collapse of the Reichsarmee;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH5.D;The end of the Holy Roman Empire has now left the many former member states without the de jure protection of the Emperor. Many German states have thus begun to expand their armies to protect themselves and to try to secure their borders as best they can. This has resulted in an opportunity for many members of our Reichsarmee to seek high ranking positions in these new armies as officers, drill instructors, or even just as well paid recruits. Unfortunately, the result has been the gutting of our own Reichsarmee - it is now a shadow of its former self, kept together only by a vague sense of loyalty among those who remain. For now we must accept the fractured state of our army until we are in a better position to enact reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH5.A;The army of Wenceslaus now laid to ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH6.T;The Ersatz Kaiser;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH6.D;”We think ourselves authorized after the example which has been given to us by the court of Anvers and the Scandinavian realm to confer onto our house as far as relates to our lands, the hereditary title of Emperor.”-Sigismund I’s Announcement of the Bohemian Empire\n\nWith the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire by the hands of Burgundy and Scandinavia, it was decided for the sake of stability to grant Sigismund the title of Emperor of Bohemia and crown him as Sigismund I. During the coronation, Sigismund was forced to sit through speeches given by the ambassadors of Burgundy and Scandinavia as they talked about how magnanimous they were to Bohemia. This humiliation has bonded some of the more conservative elements of our country together while more liberal elements mockingly deride the new title. Since this title is seen as a substitution for that of Holy Roman Emperor, many are referring to the title as Ersatz Kaiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH6.A;This is all a bad joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH7.T;The Liberal Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH7.D;Not content with the humiliating coronation, the victorious powers have also enforced a constitution of their own making onto us. This constitution looks more like a checklist for all the demands the liberals in our country have made over the years. While the constitution does guarantee free and fair elections to properted adult men, it also creates a byzantine system of checks and balances that can result in the paralysis of the entire governmental apparatus by a minority of elected officials. Nevertheless the liberals in our country seemed pleased by this, while Sigismund can only look in horror as he is forced to promulgate this constitution. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH7.A;The insults never end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH8.T;Our Diplomats in Southern Germany Have Been Expelled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH8.D;Sensing our weakened state, the Southern German states have expelled our diplomats from their countries and removed all influence we had in the region. While many feared the complete collapse of our sphere of influence, we have been able to keep some of the Elbian German states under our hold due to our long shared history with them. Still our diplomatic situation is dire and it will be a challenge to keep our sphere of influence together, let alone expand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH8.A;At least we were able to salvage something from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH9.T;The Great Bohemian Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH9.D;The end of the Holy Roman Empire has continued to haunt Bohemia and the aftershocks have constantly stunted our attempts to reassert ourselves. To combat this malaise, Karl von Schwarzenberg has called for a series of reforms to be debated and approved by a special consul. This consul will tackle the largest issues in our country. Those being army reforms, the state of religion in the Empire, and the power of the Emperor. There is no doubt that Sigismund himself will try and swing these reforms in his favor, however Schwarzenberg feels comfortable that regardless whatever tomfoolery Sigismund gets into that the end result will still be beneficial to Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH9.A;Now begins a period of national rejuvenation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH10.T;The Czech National Revival;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH10.D;With the announcement of the Great Reforms there suddenly came a new voice that demands the recognition and protection of a separate Czech identity. Already this has seemed to spark a renaissance of the Czech language with many books, plays, and speeches being created. This movement appears to have been long in the making and some  have even begun advocating for an independent Czech state to exist outside of Germany. It appears now that the reforms will have to manage the considerations of both the Germans and Czechs in order to ensure Bohemia’s survival. Favoring the Czechs too much may result in the German lands seceding from the Empire. However, favoring the Germans too much may anger some powerful Czech figures who may support a change of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH10.A;We are walking a tightrope and there is no safety net.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH11.T;The New Bohemian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH11.D;The first target of our reforms is naturally going to be what has long been the pride of our nation, the army. The army has long been in need of reform even before the Second Great German War, however because of that war we never had a chance to pursue such reforms. Now we must choose the direction of how we should reform the army and three ideas have presented themselves. First is to follow the advice of the German officers and focus on a high quality, well trained army with German as the operating language. The second plan is just to restaff and retrain the army along more conventional lines, however this will most likely only result in an army that while serviceable will not be exceptionable. Finally some veteran soldiers have advocated for a general expansion of the army, bringing in more Czechs and overwhelming our enemies by sheer numbers. No matter what option we choose it will make someone angry. The German option will anger the Czechs, the Czech option will anger the Germans, and the conventional one will anger both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH11.A;Go with German Quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH11.B;Build around conventional lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH11.C;Overwhelm with Czech quantity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH12.T;The New Bohemian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH12.D;The first target of our reforms is naturally going to be what has long been the pride of our nation, the army. The army previously had been reformed under the advice of the German officers with a focus on a high quality, well trained army with German as the operating language. Now we must choose whether to restore the army under this direction or reform the army under two new ideas. The first new plan is just to restaff and retrain the army along more conventional lines, however this will most likely only result in an army that while serviceable will not be exceptionable. Secondly some veteran soldiers have advocated for a general expansion of the army, bringing in more Czechs and overwhelming our enemies by sheer numbers. Moving away from the previous German idea will surely anger the Germans, however sticking with the German method will anger the Czechs. Whatever we choose will be the the form of our nation’s army takes for the next 50 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH13.D;The first target of our reforms is naturally going to be what has long been the pride of our nation, the army. The army previously had been reformed under the advice of veteran soldiers who advocated for a general expansion of the army, bringing in more of what are now Czechs, and aim towards overwhelming our enemies by sheer numbers. Now we must choose whether to restore the army under this direction or reform the army under two new ideas. The first new plan comes from the advice of the German officers with a focus on a high quality, well trained army with German as the operating language.

Whatever we choose will be the the form of our nation’s army takes for the next 50 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH14.A;Go with German Quality;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH15.T;The Status of Religion in Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH15.D;In the latter days of the Holy Roman Empire the matter of religion was based around the idea of “Cuius regio, eius religio” - whose realm, his religion. This was true in Bohemia as while most Germans are Catholics, a large number of the Czechs are Utraquists. These followers of Jan Hus have been in communion with Rome since the end of the Hussite Wars, affording them special religious protections. Even though the Empire is gone we have continued to follow the pluralistic ideal that whatever religion is the majority for that region will be the commanding religion there, especially among the Utraquists in particular. However, this still produces friction between the two groups as both can be prosecuted if they are in an opposing religion’s region, and hardline Catholics see Utraquists as Protestants while Utraquists insist they that are essentially Catholic. This religious divide, if handled poorly, may call into question the delicate balance of Bohemia's identity that has lain dormant for centuries under the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH15.A;Grant more rights and protections to all religions in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH15.B;Maintain Cuius regio, eius religio for our country ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH15.C;It’s time to fix this mistake. Only true Catholics belong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH16.T;Scale Back the Constitution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH16.D;Our constitution, while popular with many people, has been much maligned by both the nobility and our Emperor Sigismund I. It is no surprise that the nobles, most likely under the direction of Sigismund, have begun campaigning for the removal of certain aspects of the constitution. The nobles propose dissolving the lower house while leaving the Land Diet as the only legislative body in Bohemia which would disenfranchise many voters. Not only that, the proposal would also remove some of the restrictions on Emperor Sigismund’s power and allow him to act independent of the legislature in regards to diplomatic, military, and economic matters.. While the Germans couldn’t care less about what happens to the constitution, the constitution is popular among the Czechs as they feel that it has given them a voice in government they have never had before. For his part Karl von Schwarzenberg has been trying to rally the council in keeping the constitution, and after a long debate the council reached a decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH16.A;Leave the Constitution as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH17.D;Our constitution, while popular with many people, has been much maligned by both the nobility and our Emperor Sigismund I. It is no surprise that the nobles, most likely under the direction of Sigismund, have begun campaigning for the removal of the entire constitution. This would remove all elections in the Empire and restore the autocracy that was present at the start of Sigismund’s rule. While the Germans couldn’t care less about what happens to the constitution, the constitution is popular among the Czechs as they feel that it has given them a voice in government they have never had before.

CAEBOH18.D;After gutting the constitution it was assumed that the Emperor’s political goals were satiated. However, the nobles have approached the reform council with one more proposal, dissolving the German led Diet entirely. This would remove all elections in the Empire and restore the autocracy that was present at the start of Sigismund’s rule. To say that this proposal is unpopular is an understatement as both Germans, and even the Czechs, have spoken out against this idea. Karl von Schwarzenberg has been frantically working to prevent this from happening knowing that this can only cause more problems down the line. After much debate and even more bribes from both sides, the final decision for the Great Reforms was made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH20.D;”You all are mad, like bulls seeing a red rag! What has happened to you to overwhelm us with suspicions that we are unworthy of a great nation! What else shall I do? This misunderstanding strikes us as a personal insult.”-Sigismund I\n\nEmperor Sigismund I was scheduled to give a speech today that simply should have capped off the Great Reforms and lay out the plan for Bohemia’s future. Instead he gave out a series of complaints that admonished almost all elements of society for perceived disloyalty in the aftermath of the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and how now he expects everyone to be more accommodating to his demands. This of course has had the opposite effect and now there are now plots abound on removing Sigismund from the throne one way or the other;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH20.A;God help Sigismund for no one else is going to now;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH21.T;The Nobility Demands Sigismund’s Abdication;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH21.D;In the aftermath of Sigismund’s speech a group of prominent Bohemian and Czech nobles gathered together to decide on how they should handle their Emperor. A few talked about making a constitution to make him a figurehead, some talked about finding ways to permanently distract Sigismund from directly governing, one even proposed throwing him out a window, however no one felt that they had to go that far. In the end a decision was reached, Sigismund must abdicate the throne. They have already composed a letter signed by many powerful figures in the Bohemian realm in order to illustrate what little choice Sigismund has in the matter. The nobles have already lined up the more liberal Ludwig Wolfgang of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karstein to succeed Sigismund with the hopes that the transition will be a smooth and welcomed one. Regardless of what Sigismund does he will not be Emperor for much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH21.A;The walls are closing in on Sigismund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH22.T;The Abdication of Sigismund I;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH22.D;In the face of growing resentment and subtle threats, Sigismund I has today abdicated the title of Emperor of Bohemia.This surprising act came about following an incendiary speech Sigismund gave in the wake of recent reforms in Bohemia. The nobility unified following Sigismund’s speech along with many high ranking members of the army demanded the Emperor’s abdication or else they would refuse to support the government in any way. Seeing his support quickly evaporate Sigismund decided it was best to abdicate. With Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karstein due to become the new Emperor, the German north of the country decided to split off and declare independence because of the new Emperor’s liberal tendencies and Bohemia’s perceived anti-German bias. These new German states have also gone to Scandinavia to ask for protection from Prague. Despite this set-back the new Emperor, Ludwig I, still seems hopeful of the future and appears to be planning Bohemia’s resurgence in German politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH22.A;At least we are free of Sigismund now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH23.T;The Abdication of Sigismund I;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Seeing his support quickly evaporate Sigismund decided it was best to abdicate. Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karstein was crowned as the new Emperor of Bohemia, Ludwig I. The Bohemian public response to the ascension of Ludwig I is overall positive and both German and Czechs are rallying behind their new Emperor. The Emperor for his part seems hopeful of the future of Bohemia as a part of Germany, and appears to already be planning for Bohemia’s new place in German politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH23.A;Is this a new dawn for Bohemia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH24.T;The Great Defenestration of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH24.D;An act of hereto unforeseen violence has happened in Prague with the Emperor of Bohemia, Sigismund I, being thrown out of a window at Prague Castle to his death. This brazen act came about following an incendiary speech Sigismund gave in the wake of recent reforms in Bohemia. Czech members of the Bohemian nobility, fearing that the Bohemian Government’s string of pro-German coupled with anti-Czech decisions would lead to the loss of their positions, decided that they needed to remove Sigismund from the throne. After bribing various guards and servants in Prague Castle, the Nobles cornered Sigismund demanding his abdication. After an argument they overpowered the Emperor, eventually throwing him from a third story window. Following Sigismund’s death the nobles have formed a an regency council to try and maintain power in Bohemia and have called on Ludwig Wolfgang of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karstein to become the new Emperor. However many functions of government are refusing to listen to the council and it seems that trouble is on the horizon for Bohemia. ;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH24.A;Sigismund, we liberate ourselves from thee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH25.T;The Great Defenestration of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH25.D;The fact of the matter is that Sigismund I’s days as leader of Bohemia were numbered the moment he lost the Second Great German War. Following an incendiary speech Sigismund gave in the wake of recent reforms in Bohemia. Members of the Bohemian nobility, fearing that they might lose their positions of power, decided that they needed to remove Sigismund from the throne. After bribing various guards and servants in Prague Castle, the Nobles cornered Sigismund demanding his abdication. After an argument they overpowered the Emperor, eventually throwing him from a third story window. Following Sigismund’s death the nobles have formed a regency council to try and maintain power in Bohemia and have called on Ludwig Wolfgang of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karstein to become the new Emperor. However many functions of government are refusing to listen to the council and it seems that trouble is on the horizon for Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH25.A;Can’t say he didn’t have it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH26.T;The Bohemian Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH26.D;The nobles hoped that the death of Sigismund would solve the problems plaguing Bohemia, however it has only caused governance in the Empire to break down almost completely. The murder of Sigismund has scared off the next in line to the throne, Ludwig Wolfgang of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karstein, who fears that the nobles may kill him if he were to step out of line. Even Karl von Schwarzenberg has disappeared and no one has any idea where he could be. With the lack of any competent government official the regency council will have to try and restore order while balancing the tensions between Czechs and Germans and hopefully afterwards find a new Emperor that Bohemia deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH26.A;We just need time to piece everything together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH27.T;Germans Demand German as the National Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH27.D;With the chaos resulting from the Great Defenestration of Prague, the regency council have been forced to rely on various militia groups to help maintain order. Now a group of prominent German militias have gathered together to submit a petition to the council demanding that German become the state language for the Empire of Bohemia. Not only that it would outlaw the use of other languages, such as Czech, in any form of government or business. While the German militias have been an invaluable help such a move will alienate the Czechs and their militias may abandon their support for our government. No matter what choice is made one group will be angered, the only question is who do we anger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH27.A;German shall be the language of the realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH27.B;We aren’t here to make sweeping changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH28.T;Czechs Demand Protections For Their Own Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH28.D;After we refused the German petition to make German the national language the Czechs have submitted their own petition to demand protections for their language. Unlike the German demand, this petition only wants to ensure that Czech can be used in local governments while German will still be respected. Despite this guarantee, the Germans have made it clear that this proposal is unacceptable to them and they may not support the council in the future. Likewise the Czechs have announced that if we reject the proposal then the militias will abandon their support for our government. Once again someone is going home angry so who will it be today? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH28.A;Again we are not going to make changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH28.B;Fine, they can have these protections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH29.T;The Czech Revolts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH29.D;After we went against the Czechs in the recent language debates, our worst fears were realized. Most of the Czech militias have abandoned their support for the council and not only that but have been instigating revolts and violence throughout Bohemia. The German militias have been working overtime to try and contain the renegade militias, but this has shaken the overall support for the regency council.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH29.A;Why can’t we catch a break?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH30.T;The Prague Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH30.D;Despite our efforts, support for the regency council has been decreasing day by day. This has now reached a critical point as riots have broken out all over Prague due to the council’s inability to solve the ongoing crisis. Despite reassurances and promises nothing seems to be stemming the violence now commonplace in the heart of Bohemia. Liberal groups have also been gaining power throughout the Empire with the promise of ending the crisis by removing the nobility that they, somewhat rightfully, blame for causing Bohemia’s current problems. It appears that the council's days are numbered and unless things improve drastically they will find themselves removed from power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEBOH31.D;During the recent riots, the Catholic Archbishop of Prague, Zdenek Kolovrat, was found murdered in St. Vitus Cathedral. This horrific murder has shocked many throughout the Empire and naturally they demand a swift investigation to find the culprit. However, the ongoing crisis prevents us from putting in resources to conduct an investigation and it has instead been decided that we shall blame either the Protestant Czechs or hardline Germans for the crime. Blaming the Protestant Czechs makes sense as interfaith crime has been commonplace for a while now and no one would second guess this result. However, Kolovrat was a prominent supporter for Czech rights which does present some problems with our narrative of it being a Protestant Czech. This is why the second option of blaming a German nationalist would work, as the ethnic clashes between the two groups have been on the rise and this would be an expected escalation of what is already going on. The clock is ticking who should we pin the crime on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH31.A;Put the blame on the Czech Protestants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH31.B;Put the blame on German nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH32.T;The Religious Question Resurfaces;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH32.D;Even though we thought that the Great Reforms answered the question about religion in the Empire, the recent murder of the Archbishop has once again brought the debate back. Many proposals have been submitted to the council about increasing the religious freedoms throughout the empire to even doubling down and enforcing Catholicism as the state religion. It’s clear that the idea of Cuius regio, eius religio has no place here and a choice will have to be made. Naturally the Czechs, by enlarge, support more freedoms, while the Germans support Catholicism as the state religion. The Empire cannot handle anymore conflict and this will most likely be the last influential act the council will decide on and what happens next will be the cumulative result of the last 20 years.l ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH32.A;State Catholicism is the only real option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH32.B;Guarantee all the religious freedoms we can grant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH33.T;The Bohemian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH33.D;The farce that was the regency council has finally been put out of its misery. Today a large group of liberals, many associated with the Wolfgang Society, swarmed Prague Castle and overpowered the guards protecting the council. The liberals have announced a sweeping series of reforms which aim at restoring peace in the Empire and breaking the domination that the Germans have had over Bohemia for centuries. The liberals have made it clear that they are not seeking to establish a republic but instead a modern monarchy and have called on Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karstein to join them in bringing peace to Bohemia. This Revolution has polarized whatever remains of Bohemia society and it is unknown if the liberals will succeed in stabilizing the Empire or if they too will be overthrown. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH33.A;The Revolution stands at a precipice ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH34.T;The Bohemian Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH34.D;Many feared that following the Great Defenestration of Prague Bohemia would be stuck in an endless cycle of violence. However, following a liberal coup that overthrew the regency council, it seems that peace is finally returning to Bohemia. The liberals have been able to strike a deal with both German and Czech factions in the country that while keeping the German nature of Bohemia will ensure that the rights of the Czechs will be protected and the Czech’s themselves considered an equal part of Bohemia. Seeing the situation finally start to calm down Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karstein finally appeared and was crowned the new Emperor of Bohemia as Ludwig I by the liberals. Ludwig promises to abide by the decisions made by the new liberal government with his position made more of a ceremonial rule that serves to unify the Bohemian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH34.A;At last, our long national nightmare is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH35.T;The German Counter-Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH35.D;Ever since the Great Defenestration of Prague, Bohemia has seemingly been stuck in an endless cycle of violence. Following a liberal coup that overthrew the regency council, it seems that another coup was launched by German militias. The militia's reason for this counter-coup appears to be the cumulation of a series of anti-German decisions made by the previous regency council which has led the militias to refuse to work with any non-Germans. The militias have announced a new regency government would be established along with an introduction of martial law to restore order. The German militias have since spread out and are conducting a purge to remove any perceived threat to their rule which has fallen mostly onto Czechs from all aspects of society. Despite the barbarity of their actions it seems that order is returning to Bohemia and Bohemia may soon reassert itself in Central Europe. As for who will be the new Emperor? That debate seems to keep getting postponed and may never truly be answered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH35.A;Böhmen war, ist und wird deutsch sein!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH36.T;The Germans Launch a Counter-Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH36.D;While the Bohemian Revolution had large popular support, one group they did not have the support of was the Germans. After years of what has been perceived as Czech favoritism the German militias marched onto Prague Castle, and easily removed the new liberal government. The militias announced a new regency government would be established along with an introduction of marital law to restore order. However when the militias left to enforce their order they found stiff resistance throughout the city. While the German militias are slowly gaining ground it appears the goal for a swift coup and assumption of government will not be accomplished. So long as there are no big surprises the Germans will eventually secure their rule over Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH36.A;Something’s wrong, I can feel it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH37.T;The Bohemian Break-up;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH37.D;Bohemia had seemingly been stuck in an endless cycle of violence following the Great Defenestration of Prague. However the chaos has finally reached a crescendo with the entire country of Bohemia breaking up forever. First the regency council was ousted by liberals, which then led to a counter-coup by German militias. These militias tried to enforce their order but instead were chased off by Czech militias which finally secured power and announced the creation of a Czech-led state that would be forever removed from the politics of German Unification. Naturally this was met with outrage with the Germans in the country and the German regions have begun breaking off and have been asking Scandinavia for support. Not only that but Silesia has also broken off in the chaos declaring their own independent government, though supported by no one currently. Regardless of what has happened the Czechs are now free and now must find their place in the world outside of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH37.A;And so ends Bohemia and its role in Germany…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH38.T;The Legacy of the Hamburg Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH38.D;In order to try and bring people to our cause regarding a German Confederation we need something for them to rally around. Luckily nothing brings people together faster than having a common enemy. Scandinavia has long worked to ensure their continued domination of Northern Germany and are constantly working on moving southwards. Let us remind our people and our fellow Germans what life is like under Scandinavia and the terrors they can expect. We shall remind everyone of the Hamburg Massacre where Scandinavian soldiers murdered Germans who were only trying to seek recompense from the hardships Scandinavia put on them during the Great German War. As we have constantly fought against Scandinavia we will show the North German states that we will stand up for them and ensure that what happened in Hamburg will never happen to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAEBOH38.A;Scandinavia is a threat to all Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH39.T;The Unification of the Elbian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH39.D;CAE is being unified and you are targeted for unification. If you are playing Saxony here then its advised that you restart to a game in where Scandinvia still controls the north because this is clearly unfair for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAEBOH39.A:O fuck. (Exit Hamlet.);;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA1.T;The Lost Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA1.D;The loss of northern Germany has been a bitter subject ever since the end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. So long as foreign powers dominate the region, we shall never truly be able to consolidate our own country and more importantly proclaim our leadership over the Elbian Germans…and perhaps the whole German people in the future. While Burgundy and Scandinavia have both contested this region in the past, Scandinavia’s protectorate over the Elbe has made them our chief enemy. Now we have conceived a plan to send agents into Scandinavian territory and provoke them into brutalizing the Elbians as they once did in Hamburg, to justify a new crusade to liberate the Elbe! But before we strike against them, we must be certain of the Elbians’ political position. There is still a chance that they may betray their supposed Scandinavian overlords in the name of a united Germany. Or they might even strike out on their own and become a third actor in this drama…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA1.A;Come what may, Germany can be divided no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA2.T;The Saxon Limitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA2.D;The unification of the Saxon domains has been a thorny subject ever since the end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. So long as a so-called “Plattdeutsch state” exists, we shall never be able to proclaim our leadership over the Elbian Germans…and perhaps the whole German people in the future. While Burgundy and Scandinavia have both contested this region in the past, Scandinavia’s increasing interference in the Elbe has made them our chief enemy. Now we have conceived a plan to send agents into Scandinavian territory and provoke Scandinavia into brutalizing the Elbians as they once did in Hamburg, to justify a new crusade to liberate the Elbe! But before we strike against them, we must be certain of the Saxons’ political position. While they may betray us it is hoped that they will instead join forces with us in the name of a united Germany. Or they might even strike out on their own and become a third actor in this drama…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA2.A;Come what may, Germany can be divided no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA3.T;The Intolerable Status of the Elbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA3.D;Ever since the end of the Holy Roman Empire, northern Germany has been divided. So long as this division persists then we shall never be able to proclaim our leadership over the Elbian Germans…and perhaps the whole German people in the future. While Burgundy and Scandinavia have both contested this region in the past, Scandinavia’s increasing interference in the Elbe has made them our chief enemy. Now we have conceived a plan to provoke Scandinavia into brutalizing the Elbians as they once did in Hamburg, to justify a new crusade to liberate the Elbe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA3.A;Germany can be divided no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA4.T;Ominous Rumors of an Elbian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA4.D;Nobody can quite say where the trend started, but more and more members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political world seem convinced that a military confrontation between the Bohemians and the Scandinavians is both inevitable and imminent. News articles in both liberal and conservative papers have begun to cover the possibility of a war between the two powers, and their editorials question on which side we will find ourselves. We even believe that agents of the Bohemian government are lurking in the capital, eager for an answer, though curiously we have seen no sign of Scandinavian agents…It seems that the matter boils down to this question : Where does our national sympathy lie? Does it lie with the Scandinavians of the north? The Bohemians of the south? Or only with Germany? §RWhichever power triumphs in the war to come will surely seek to turn their attention upon us - unless we take a stand against both.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA4.A;§RWe must support Bohemia.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA4.B;To Hell with the foreigners, we shall fight only for Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA4.C;§dWe must support Scandinavia.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA5.T;$FROM$ Supports Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA5.D;We have received effective confirmation that $FROM$ will support Bohemia in any upcoming confrontation with Scandinavia. The mood in their country is decisively in favor of our status as the leader of the German people! We can rest assured that when hostilities break out, $FROM$ will be with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA5.A;Wunderbar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA6.T;$FROM$ Seems to Support Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA6.D;We have received mixed responses from $FROM$ as to whether they would support us in a war with Scandinavia. While they certainly do not seem loyal to Copenhagen, they also do not seem particularly attached to Prague, either. It is tempting to expect their support anyway but they may very well have plans of their own. We should be cautious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA6.A;At least they will not side with the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA7.T;Elbian Support for Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA7.D;We have received indications that the government of $FROM$ will support Scandinavia in any upcoming confrontation with us! Their leaders have exploited apathy amongst their populace to turn them against pan-German nationalism in favor of unity with the Nordics. This is a great setback but we have also discovered that the Thuringians are the least loyal to Copenhagen and thus we may be able to induce them to betray their own masters and support us instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA7.A;At least we now know who our enemies are…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA8.T;The Infiltration;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA8.D;Much of northern Germany still holds plenty of anti-Scandinavian sentiment. It is merely dormant, waiting for a spark to set it alight once again. Our agents have made contact with the Tugendbund or “League of Virtue,” officially known as the “Society for the Exercise of Morality,” a Hamburg-based pan-German nationalist group operating under the guise of a mutual aid society. The Tugendbund is small and most of its current members are older military veterans with little talent for intrigue but they are fanatically devoted to their cause. We shall provide them with weapons and logistical assistance, to incite a revolt in Hamburg during an upcoming ceremony to commemorate the Hamburg Massacre, where, during the Great German War, Scandinavian forces shot down a crowd of unarmed citizens seeking to block their entry into the city and prevent them from crushing its Dahlkist government. Scandinavia will surely repress this revolt with force, allowing us to demand they relinquish control of northern Germany to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA8.A;And if they refuse…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA9.T;The Hamburg Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA9.D;In a completely unexpected turn of events, the memorial ceremony in Hamburg escalated after several German nationalists made impromptu speeches denouncing Scandinavian tyranny. The mood became so excited that the crowds began to roam through the streets and attack Scandinavian-owned businesses. It was only through deployment of the whole Hamburg police force that the agitation was ended, yet while the immediate violence has ceased, unrest continues to simmer throughout the greater Hamburg area. Small clashes between Hamburgers and the authorities are now becoming commonplace, and it is only a matter of time before the matter completely explodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA9.A;We’re all trying to find the ones who did this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA10.T;The Hamburger Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA10.D;The death of an unarmed German nationalist in a demonstration outside of the local Hamburg tax office has caused the local unrest to erupt into an all-out insurrection. Battles have now begun to rage across the city between the authorities and German nationalists. In some cases, when the local authorities came out to contain the spiralling chaos, unior officers defected to the rebels instead! Even the policemen who remained loyal to Copenhagen were forced to retreat under the fire of unexpectedly well-armed Hamburgers. Barricades have now been erected by both the crowds and the police at different points within the city, and several neighborhoods have been entirely sealed off, as trade in Hamburg grinds to a halt. Scandinavia will surely take aggressive action to put down the revolt before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA10.A;The people of Hamburg have made their voices heard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA11.T;The Hamburg Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA11.D;The city of Hamburg had, over the last few weeks, become a battleground between German revolutionaries and Scandinavian loyalists. With the local police crippled by defections to the rebels, but not wanting to repeat the carnage of the Bremen Massacre, Scandinavia decided to call out the Holstein militia. These men were trained and led by Scandinavian officers and mostly from rural areas, so it was hoped that they would not be so liable to defect. What Scandinavia did not realize was just how little sympathy the militiamen had for the Hamburgers. The rebels were bombarded into submission by cannon fire, and entire city blocks were torched in order to either smoke out the rebels or turn their makeshift defenses into funeral pyres. The resulting devastation is an order of magnitude larger than that of the Bremen Massacre years ago and has provoked an even more furious reaction across the German cultural world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA11.A;THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA12.T;Responding to the Hamburg Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA12.D;Scandinavia has once again shed the blood of the Elbian German people for the crime of daring to demand their freedom from Copenhagen. The news from Hamburg is grim, with whole neighborhoods having been destroyed in the violent crushing of the recent nationalist uprising. Many within our government are demanding that we cut all ties to Scandinavia in response. However a few individuals close to our head of state have approached him in private and alleged that the violence may have been deliberately provoked by an outside power - Bohemia is the obvious suspect. Even so this represents a valuable opportunity to remove all Scandinavian influence from our nation should we desire to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA12.A;Terminate all diplomatic contact with Scandinavia at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA12.B;Summon the Scandinavian ambassador for an explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
CAESCA13.T;Our Ultimatum to Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA13.D;Scandinavia’s recent atrocities in Hamburg cannot go unanswered. Any doubt that their rule in northern Germany is to the utter detriment of its denizens has been erased by the blood which they have let flow through the streets of the former Free City. As we are the natural protectors of the German people, we shall now issue an ultimatum to the Scandinavian government : Turn over all ethnically German lands under their control to us, or face war. In light of the circumstances we foresee few objections to this demand by the other Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA13.A;The hour of destiny draws nearer…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA14.T;The Bohemian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA14.D;A series of pan-German nationalist demonstrations in Hamburg recently turned into a full-fledged uprising by rioters who sought to overrun the city and secede from Scandinavia. With the police compromised and mindful of the role which the Army played in the Bremen Massacre years ago, we instead mobilized the Holstein militia to the city. Unfortunately the mostly rural recruits had little sympathy for their urban counterparts and little hesitation in using the most destructive methods at their disposal to squash the uprising. Now whole city blocks have been gutted by fires and by bombardment and the city remains under martial law. Bohemia has had the gall to use this horrifying tragedy as an opportunity to demand that we surrender all Elbian German lands to them! We obviously cannot accept, yet the current disorder in the south has seen the Elbian lands plunge into chaos. Nobody can say whether our control over them will be preserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA14.A;THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA15.T;The Elbians Defect to Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA15.D;When we took control of the Elbian Germans we always knew that it was possible they might rebel. Yet few within our government had expected this level of treason. The Elbians have not only dissolved all diplomatic ties with us, they have openly pledged loyalty to the Bohemians! Our southern front is now in grave danger and we are desperately attempting to convince the non-Saxon parts of the Elbian domain to counter-secede back into our protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA15.A;Et tu, brute?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA16.T;The Elbians Remain Loyal;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA16.D;Our control over the Elbian Germans has not yet been completely compromised. While we have heard numerous reports of pro-nationalist protests breaking out in northern Germany, these actions have not prevented the political elite from maintaining order. As of now the region is still firmly in Scandinavian hands. If Bohemia wants to claim the lands of the Elbe then they shall have an uphill battle in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA16.A;Thank God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA17.T;The Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA17.D;Scandinavia’s grip upon northern Germany has finally broken. News of the Second Hamburg Massacre spread across the nation like wildfire, leaving outrage in its wake. At last the Junkers have realized that Scandinavia has never had their interests at heart, and have utterly rejected their Nordic overlords in the most vivid possible way. This morning the government ordered the army into the streets to place all Scandinavian civil and military officials within the nation under arrest! After a brief struggle in the capital, the Scandinavian garrison was forcibly disarmed and locked in the city prison under armed guard along with all non-diplomatic Scandinavian personnel. The government has now sworn loyalty to Bohemia and has placed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army under their command. However much of the nation is now in chaos and Scandinavia’s remaining loyalists may try to secede.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA17.A;We must defend our freedom at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA18.T;The Pro-Scandinavian Counterrevolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA18.D;The Nordelbians have never felt truly at home within our nation. These regions have seen considerable Scandinavian investment, building the economic independence of their communities apart from the traditional Junker manorial system. It is this reduction of Junker influence, and the corresponding good will fostered towards Scandinavia amongst the locals, which has now created an unpleasant situation. Multiple Nordelbian regions have declared secession and have aligned with Scandinavia instead! They claim that our glorious revolution is some sort of reactionary plot by Bohemia, a power towards which they hold little affection;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA18.A;Traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA19.T;Luneburg Declares for Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA19.D;The Electorate of Luneburg had cherished its independent status and gave it up only reluctantly. Their elites had become skeptical of Bohemian influence even before the end of the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia’s entrenchment into northern Germany only strengthened this belief. Now the Luneburgers have declared their secession from $COUNTRY$ and have pledged their loyalty to Scandinavia! They claim that we have “betrayed our oaths” by purging the Nordic parasites within our midst, and that we are simply the puppets of Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA19.A;Traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA20.T;The Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA20.D;Scandinavia’s grip upon northern Germany has finally broken! German nationalists have risen up across $FROM$ and ousted their old overlords. Its government has pledged loyalty to Bohemia and placed its troops at our disposal. The nature of this revolution is such that, if Scandinavia does not soon restore their control over the Elbians, then they shall never again be able to hold a similar level of influence. A great blow for the freedom of the German people has been struck, and now we must prepare ourselves for the struggle to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA20.A;Welcome home, countrymen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA21.T;The Great Northern War;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA21.D;”It is harsh in the world, whoredom rife - an axe age, a sword age - shields are riven - a wind age, a wolf age - before the world goes headlong. No man will have mercy on another.” - The Völuspá, as recorded in the Poetic Edda, Volume II\n\nSince the days of the Norse, Scandinavian powers have sought control over the Baltic. That conflict has now once more led Scandinavia into conflict with Bohemia, long the protector of the Germans and recently recovering its strength. While the spark of this conflict lies in yet another Scandinavian atrocity in Holstein, its roots are the struggle for dominance of northern Germany between the two powers. Only total victory will save Scandinavia’s position amongst the Elbian Germans. Anything less will end their authority in the region and cast northern Germany adrift into an uncertain future. This war shall be the Twilight of the Gods - but which gods? Those in Copenhagen? Those in Prague? Or both?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA21.A;Germany shall be reborn in fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA22.T;The Pomeranian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA22.D;Years ago in Venice it was ruled that we would be forced to surrender Scandinavian Pomerania - a term which has come to encompass the whole eastern German coastline - to the Holy Roman Empire. We defied this demand, but the Elbian Germans never forgot or forgave our actions. Now a pan-German nationalist group known as the Tugenbund or the “League of Virtue'' has come out of the shadows across Pomerania to spearhead a revolution against our rule. The Pomeranian militias were compromised by the Tugenbund and betrayed their oath of loyalty to Scandinavia in favor of joining with the rebels. Communities across Pomerania are now being seized by pan-German nationalists who have in turn sworn loyalty to the Elbian German state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA22.A;The debt at last comes due…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA23.T;Intervene in the Great Northern War?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA23.D;Bohemia and Scandinavia are now locked in a vicious struggle for the fate of Germany. Whoever prevails will become the undoubted hegemon of the Elbe. Yet perhaps we might be able to cause an upset and surpass both powers…but only if we play our cards right. At the moment Scandinavia has by far more to lose in this contest than Bohemia, and is also in a more vulnerable position. If we want to assume leadership of the German people in the future then we must take an active role in defending them now. §RIf we fail to support Bohemia in this contest and they defeat Scandinavia, then garnering opposition to them in the future shall become much more difficult.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA23.A;Scandinavia shall get what it so richly deserves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA23.B;All we want is to protect our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA24.T;The Treaty of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA24.D;Fortune has not favored Scandinavia. Bohemia has driven us out of Germany in its entirety and we have been unable to reclaim our lands, forcing us to sue for peace. The resulting treaty has stripped us of all German-speaking lands in the former Holy Roman Empire. Bohemia has consolidated her position within Germany towards her own interest, bringing more and more of the Elbe beneath a single leadership. The announcement of this treaty has provoked apocalyptic fury towards the government across Scandinavian society. Many are calling not merely for the current administration’s resignation, but for its overthrow, in the face of this unmitigated disaster. The military is particularly irate at our failure and blames political interference from the civilian leadership for “stabbing Scandinavia in the back.” Revolution from the left or right could come at any moment and any possibility of advancing Scandinavian rule over Germany has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAESCA25.D;Fortune has not favored Bohemia. Scandinavia has shattered our offensive and brought the breadth of the Elbe Basin under its control, forcing us to sue for peace.

CAESCA26.D;Fortune has scowled upon Central Europe. Neither Bohemia nor Scandinavia could achieve a convincing victory, fighting one another to a stalemate. As a result the two powers were forced to sign a peace treaty in the neutral city of Barcelona.

No more shall the Elbian German people bend our knees for distant masters! We have ordered the expulsion of all Bohemian personnel from our nation, and interned their garrisons. The Junkers have reclaimed their rightful position as stewards of Germany, and shall lead us to battle against our ancient Bohemian oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA33.A;Onwards, to a purified Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAESCA34.D;There is an old saying : Never trust anyone who boasts to you of having lied to someone else. It is an adage which we ought to have heeded regarding the Elbians. Having been freed from Scandinavian oppression, they have now had the gall to turn upon us! The Junkers have executed a coup to consolidate state power within the hands of the nobility and have proclaimed the independence of $FROM$. All Bohemian officials within $FROM$ have been expelled and the few Bohemian soldiers stationed there interned. We have reason to believe that they do not merely desire to carve out a nation for themselves, but that they wish to challenge us for the mantle of the leading candidate to unify Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA34.A;THIS WILL NOT STAND.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA35.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA35.D;It was hoped that the power of the Junkers would keep foreign influences out of $FROM$ and preserve our independence. Yet the nobles have instead turned their resources towards the oppression of our own citizens, and failed to leverage our nation’s strength in the cause of German unity. Now the time has come for the people to take matters into their own hands. Yesterday an outspoken liberal lawyer named Helmuth Oppler led a crowd of radical demonstrators to the National Landtag, demanding extensive reforms. Instead the city guards fired upon them to prevent them from storming the building, setting off a night of rioting. The violence continued into the morning and Oppler rallied the republicans to come out in force and seize the city! The Fallschwertmaschienen have been raised throughout the capital, and Oppler has been proclaimed Chairman of the League of Magdeburg. He has proclaimed that the League shall become the foundation of a unified German republic..;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA35.A;Freiheit, Gleichheit, Brüderlichkeit! (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!);;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA36.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA36.D;Chaos has erupted across northern Germany. The Junkers have been assaulted by hordes of radical republicans, who have overthrown the government and installed a new regime under liberal lawyer Helmuth Oppler. Fallschwertmaschienen have been erected in all the major communities of the nation, and revolutionary tribunals have been instituted to formally deliver the Junkers unto them. Worst of all, Oppler and his cohorts have sworn that their “League of Magdeburg” shall adopt German unification as their official foreign policy! This represents an extreme danger to Bohemia, one which cannot be allowed to persist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA36.A;Crush them AT ONCE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA37.T;The Matter of Saxony;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA37.D;The continued existence of an independent Saxony presents an obstacle to our consolidation of northern Germany. So long as it persists, we will be unable to fully consolidate the Elbe beneath our leadership. However, a few members of the foreign office have arrived at a solution. They have proposed that we offer Saxony membership within a united Elbian Federation under our authority, in exchange for giving Saxony and its elites the leading role within said government. While it is possible that the Saxons will defy us, this is a quite generous offer considering the present condition of Germany and so they are likely to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA37.A;Make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA38.T;The Saxon Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA38.D;The division of northern Germany can no longer be tolerated if we are to preserve our control of the region. The foreign office has proposed that we create a united Elbian Federation under our authority, until such time as we can more properly integrate the region. This would also aid our dismantlement of the traditional Junker manorial system in the area. While it is possible that a united Elbian state could chafe beneath our control, if the past has shown us anything it is that allowing multiple separate Elbian governments to exist unsupervised is not a wise idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA38.A;We must consolidate our position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA39.T;The Elbian Consolidation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAESCA41.T;Scandinavian Offers Us Leadership of an Elbian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA41.D;It is an unfortunate fact that we remain beneath the shadow of Scandinavia. Yet our nation is far from impotent, a fact of which even Copenhagen is conscious. They have now proposed to make our nation the foundation of a new Elbian Federation beneath their protection. They argue that this consolidation of the Elbian Germans is to the region’s economic interest, but it is clear they also want to have a more efficient space within which to wield their influence. Yet such a nation could, when Scandinavia is vulnerable, be used as a weapon against their hegemony…They have left the final decision up to us, but it is clear that if we refuse then they shall force us into this new nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA41.A;Perhaps we can turn this to our advantage…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA41.B;We shall sooner welcome death than live as slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA42.T;The Formation of the Elbian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA42.D;The heads of state of the realms of northern Germany met in Lubeck to sign the treaty establishing a unified Elbian Federation. This government shall coordinate all matters of taxation, internal development, and other matters of domestic policy. However Scandinavia shall be the arbiter of its foreign policy and shall have the right during wartime to assume control of its armed forces. Many challenges lie ahead : the Elbian basin has yet to recover from the Hollowing, its economy is underdeveloped compared to other parts of Germany, and the peoples of this new Elbian state, despite sharing the same language, do not at all think of themselves as one nation. If we are to remain within northern Germany then we must labor to make the Elbian Federation a truly prosperous land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA42.A;They deserve no less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA43.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA43.D;Scandinavia’s attempt to maintain control of northern Germany has failed. The Junkers, long opposed to Scandinavia’s disruptive so-called “reforms,” have decided to strike back and defend their fatherland. This morning the government ordered the army into the streets to place all Scandinavian civil and military officials within the nation under arrest! After a brief struggle in the capital, the Scandinavian garrison was forcibly disarmed and locked in the city prison under armed guard along with all non-diplomatic Scandinavian personnel. No more shall the Elbian German people bend our knees for distant masters! The Junkers have reclaimed their rightful position as stewards of Germany, and shall lead us to battle against the Scandinavian invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA43.A;Alles fur Deutschland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA44.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA44.D;In retrospect, the establishment of a unified Elbian German nation may have been a fool’s errand. The consolidation of the region has, rather than making it easier to control, allowed the treacherous Junkers to combine their strength against us. This morning we received word of a reactionary coup d’etat in the Elbian Federation against us! The nobles of the realm have organized an anti-Scandinavian coalition under the banner of the League of Magdeburg, and have declared their intention to fight for their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA44.A;They WILL regret this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA45.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA45.D;Bohemia’s rapidly growing power in northern Germany threatens to allow them to completely consolidate the Elbian basin under their control. This cannot be permitted! The Elbian Germans cannot pass into the night without one final, glorious struggle for our liberty. We have made contact with anti-Bohemian elements across the region who are willing to join forces with ourselves to fight against Prague’s dominion. At our signal they shall rise up and pledge allegiance, allowing us to lead the coalition against the Bohemians. The risk of this endeavor is tremendous, but in the face of Bohemia’s resurgence throughout northern Germany, we have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA45.A;We must fight for our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA46.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA46.D;”Desperate? Of course we are desperate. Everything in a revolution is desperate : it is always a choice between desperation now and safety later, or safety now and liberty never.” - Marinus Dahlke\n\nThe consolidation of Bohemia’s influence across northern Germany has caused more and more Elbians to chafe under their renewed authority. Saxony has now taken up the banner of insurrection, rallying the Elbian German people beneath the banner of a united Elbian state. Despite nationalist rebels rising up across northeastern Germany to bring the region under Saxony’s control, few international observers expect the revolution to succeed. If there is to be any chance of Bohemia’s restoration of its control over Germany being thwarted, then it shall be decided here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA46.A;A noble but futile gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA460.T;The Second Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA460.D;We have allowed a foreign power to gain economic hegemony in our Elbian protectorate. This has cut the legs out from underneath its institutions, and allowed Elbian nationalists to move back into the public eye. This morning they struck, with cells of nationalist militias assaulting government strongholds across the realm before seizing the administrative center and declaring independence! Bohemia has wasted no time in declaring their new nation an illegitimate state and they will almost certainly invade them as soon as they are able. We have lost control of northern Germany, perhaps this time forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA460.A;Damn, damn, damn, damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA47.T;Die Katastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA47.D;”Death is not worse than a dishonorable life which destroys its own soul as well as that of its neighbor.” - Vaclav Dvorák, Czech author and nationalist\n\nThe legitimacy of the Bohemian government has hinged upon its determination to prove its worth as a defender of the German people. The failure of successive Bohemian administrations to liberate the Germans of the Baltic coast put the lie to that notion. The radical opponents of the Bohemian government, sensing its weakness, have now seized upon the unrest created in Prague by a protest about high bread prices to marshall their supporters. Across the city, liberals, socialists, and both German and Czech nationalists are now brawling. The government is paralyzed between those who wish to court the reformists and those who wish to summon the Bohemian Army to cleanse the city of dissent. Nobody can predict what will happen next but the future of Bohemia has never looked worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA47.A;God have mercy upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA471.T;Die Katastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA471.D;”Death is not worse than a dishonorable life which destroys its own soul as well as that of its neighbor.” - Vaclav Dvorák, Czech author and nationalist\n\nBohemian leadership over the German people is now a dead letter, as the German heartland has sprung from Prague's grasp, be it through war or intrigue. The radical opponents of the Bohemian government, sensing its weakness, have now seized upon the unrest created in Prague by a protest about high bread prices to marshal their supporters. Across the city, liberals, socialists, and both German and Czech nationalists are now brawling.

CAESCA470.D;”Death is not worse than a dishonorable life which destroys its own soul as well as that of its neighbor.” - Vaclav Dvorák, Czech author and nationalist\n\nThe legitimacy of the Bohemian government has been founded upon the prestige of the House of Jagiellon and its support of the German-speaking elites against the Slavic lower classes. Now this delicate balance has been destroyed. The trouble began when Chancellor Franz Watzlawik, von Schwartzenberg’s successor, attempted to flee Prague to avoid anti-government riots over high bread prices, only to be caught by an angry mob of republicans and strung up from a streetlamp. Emperor Sigismund V barricaded himself inside of Prague Castle for his own safety, paralyzing the government. Now liberals, socialists, and both German and Czech nationalists have taken to brawling through the streets in the midst of this anarchy. Nobody can predict what will happen next but the future of Bohemia has never looked worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA470.A;God have mercy upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA48.T;The $YEAR$ Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA48.D;The government was forced to make massive concessions to the rebels in order to avert a revolution. A new constitution has been quickly drafted and adopted whose terms include a universal male franchise, more equitable composition of the Diet, the right to public assembly, and the right to freedom of the press. The powers of the head of state have also been greatly curtailed. The most significant proviso was the establishment of Czech as the second national language of Bohemia alongside German, and that the government must strive for bilingualism going forwards. Time will tell if these provisions will actually be honored but for the time being most liberals in Bohemia have been satisfied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA48.A;We shall do what we must to survive…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA49.T;The Ossification of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA49.D;We have managed to ride out the worst of the unrest. The extremists have been contained, and the moderates have reconciled with our government. The placating of the Czechs especially has bought our government a new lease on life. Yet a general sense of malaise is slowly creeping into the Bohemian spirit. Nobody can place a finger on the exact cause, but the national mood is becoming distinctly sour. There is a sense that we have missed our chance to make our mark upon history, that the fate of our nation will never be as great now as it may have been. Perhaps this is all just the prattle of pessimists, but we cannot ignore the possibility that, in choosing the path of safety, we have turned our back upon our destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA49.A;Peace in our time…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA50.T;The Prague Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA50.D;The government’s promises of reforms failed to calm the masses. They remembered well how many times in the past the government had made similar assurances, only to take advantage of a lull in rebel activity to crush them. The socialists have convinced enough of the liberals to defect to their ranks to prevail in the street fighting, and seized control of most of Prague just after the head of state and his family were able to escape. The rebel leaders, led by half-Czech socialist ideologue and Chairman of the National Ironworkers’ Union Klement Dressler, declared the Prague Commune! “Premier” Dressler has called upon “the Bohemian proletariat” to launch a general strike to “cast down the bourgeois edifice of the old Bohemian order.” The military is clamoring for a brutal crackdown to purge Bohemian of Blanquist elements, but the interior minister insists that we can snip the revolt in the bud by capturing the national labor leadership outside of Prague.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA50.A;§RFIAT IUSTITIA, ET PEREAT MUNDUS!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA50.B;Arrest every union leader that you can find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA51.T;The Bohemian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA51.D;In the end the final actions of the old Bohemian regime did nothing but hasten its end. Arresting major labor leaders only ensured that there was nobody for the government to negotiate with to end the general strike or to order the unions to stand down, and attacks against labor unions and village self-defense collectives only pushed urban workers and rural farmers into one another's’ arms. Soon the military read the writing on the wall and scores of junior officers defected to the Commune, taking their soldiers with them. Within days, the old government had been dismantled, its remaining loyalists either driven into exile or given their eternal reward. A referendum was organized by the revolutionaries to authenticate their popular mandate, and with overwhelming support, the Blanquists have prevailed over all rivals. The time of $COUNTRY$ is over. The glorious age of the Bohemian Socialist Republic has begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA51.A;Die Wahrheit siegt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA52.T;Der weiße Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA52.D;”After receiving information about the Socialists, the commander of the captured detachment was shot. Under Colonel Engelbert Radetzky, there was some especially painful cruelty. I know of many cases when under the influence of hatred for the Socialists, the officers assumed the duties of shooting the captured volunteers. The executions were necessary because under the conditions in which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army had to move with the utmost speed, prisoners could not be taken…Hermsdorf we left a graveyard. The wives of the dead searched constantly for bodies, unaware of the horror behind the walls of Schloss Kynast. At least 2500 people were killed. Entire carts of bodies were carried there, like winter lamb and pork carcasses…” - Alois Brod, Bohemian veteran\n\nWe have suppressed the Blanquist menace. All major figures connected to left-wing organizations are being hunted down, and excessively leftist trade unions have been liquidated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA52.A;Pure necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA53.T;The Dissolution of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA53.D;”The motto of the old Empire : ‘Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus’ - Let justice prevail, though the world perish. The motto of modern Bohemia : ‘Fiat iustitia, aut pereat mundus’ - Let both justice and the world perish.” - Silesian satirist Antonin Havel\n\nThe struggle to crush both the liberals and the socialists left us open to the Czech nationalists. Summoning reinforcements from the countryside, they seized control of Prague with the help of ethnic Czech military defectors. Their first act was to proclaim the establishment of a new, truly Czech state, launching brutal purges of German-speaking nobles and intellectuals throughout the nation. In light of this revolutionary bloodshed, the old Bohemian realm has broken apart, with regional elites in the north declaring independence. The last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation has signed its own death warrant : Bohemia has erased itself from the face of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAESCA54.T;A New King?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
CAESCA54.D;With the true stewards of Germany now once more in control of the Bohemians and the Elbians, we must decide upon a Head of State. There is an attraction in maintaining the "military state" as a law unto itself, but if we want recognition from the rest of Europe then we should at least put up a figurehead monarch to legitimize ourselves. There are two main candidates now that the Jagiellons have been cast out. The first is the House of Reuss, an obscure Saxon dynasty which would surely be grateful to us if the Diet were to nominate their Prince Heinrich XXIII as sovereign. The second is the House of Piast in southern Silesia, which maintains an old claim to the Bohemian throne. The Piasts were the first kings of Poland in ages past but now seem estranged from that land. While they understand that the new monarch would be a mere symbol for our regime they have insisted upon the candidacy of their Prince Leszek III to be the next ruler. A Piast puppet king might keep the Slavs quiet but some wonder if they have secret aspirations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAESCA55.T;The Rise of Elbian German Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA55.D;Our leadership of the Germans is once again in doubt. The northerners put their trust in us with the expectation that we would make definitive progress towards the unification of Germany. Yet this has not occurred : Bohemia remains as it was when the Empire fell. This situation is becoming untenable, as the Elbian Germans question whether they might be better off with a state for themselves. Time is running out to keep Elbian German separatist nationalism in check. §RIf we have not consolidated northern Germany under a more unified government in the near future, then this process may become irreversible.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA55.A;We WILL bring unity to the Elbe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA56.T;The Elbian Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA56.D;The Elbian Germans have lost their patience with us. Deploring the lack of progress towards German unification by Bohemia, they have taken matters into their own hands. Several German nationalist parties had for some time been advocating for an independence referendum for the north, a measure repeatedly declared illegal by our government. But it did not matter : loyalty to Prague in the north has fallen to such lows that not even the authorities were willing to stop them. The referendum was held, despite our attempts to quash it, and passed with overwhelming support. All Elbian German territories have now proclaimed themselves sovereign and separate from Bohemia. With no other option, we have declared martial law in the north and are mustering the army to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA56.A;THESE CRIMINALS WILL PAY!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA57.T;The Elbian Divorce;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA57.D;The Elbian German territories’ sudden independence from Bohemia in the aftermath of an independence referendum which Prague continuously denounced as illegal was feared to be the start of a civil war. However the Bohemian military, dominated as it is by Czech soldiers, became paralyzed with mutinies and insubordination when it was ordered north to crush the separatists. Many units refused to leave their barracks. As a result the democratic parties of the Diet - many of whom are dominated by Czech interests - were able to join forces with a handful of German defectors from the conservative parties to force through a bill recognizing Elbian German independence. Civil war has been avoided but any hope of Bohemia claiming a renewed position of leadership of the German people may now have been lost forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA57.A;It had to be this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA58.T;The Czech Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAESCA58.D;"Seek the truth, hear the truth, learn the truth, love the truth, speak the truth, hold the truth and defend the truth until death.” - Jan Hus\n\nThe Bohemian government ordering its predominantly Czech army to crush the Elbian German separatists, after having declared their independence referendum to be illegal, proved to be a fatal error. Units across Bohemia mutinied, rallying instead to the Czech nationalists, who called upon the soldiers to see through the lies of their leaders, for the Czech people to see Bohemia for what it was : an oppressive German regime over a Slavic nation. These rebels marched on Prague, where they deposed the government and proclaimed a new, truly Czech state. All German territories once controlled by the old regime have disavowed Prague, either joining the Elbian Germans or going their own way. The last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation has been swept away by the will of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA58.A;Pravda vítezí! (Truth prevails!);;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CAESCA59.T;The Junker Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA59.D;The Danubian Federation’s radical liberalism has alarmed the Elbian nobility. It is no secret that the southerners see themselves as the leading candidates to unify Germany, but none of our Junkers have any desire for a liberal Germany. Thus they have decided to act. This morning a group of army officers, bolstered by far-right militias organized with Junker support, led their regiments into $CAPITAL$ and declared the formation of a new government! At the head of the coup d’etat was Count Maximilian Erwin von Aroldingen und Eltzingen, a man whose eloquence and aggressive personality has made up for his dynastic obscurity. He has now been crowned King Maximilian of the Elbian League, and seeks to herald a German rebirth fueled by conservative nationalism. It seems that the future clash between north and south shall be one of both geography and ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA59.A;Long live King Maximilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA60.T;The Elbian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA60.D;The Danubian Confederation’s far-right turn has alarmed the Elbian intelligentsia. It is no secret that the southerners see themselves as the leading candidate to unify Germany, but no liberal has any desire for a reactionary Germany. Thus they have decided to act. This morning a crowd of activists gathered outside the national legislature in $CAPITAL$, demanding a new constitution. Martial law was declared only for junior army officers to lead their regiments over to the liberals! Soon both the legislature and the executive mansion were stormed, and Radicalist revolutionaries led by author Gunther Rosenberg declared the creation of the League of Magdeburg. Rosenberg, acclaimed as Consul of the League (after Marinus Dahlke’s title), has declared that “Germany shall be whole, free, and she will be free - free of oppression, free of foreign occupation, and free of old idols and old tyrants.” It seems that the future clash between north and south shall be one of both geography and ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAESCA61.T;The Elbian Constitutional Convention of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA61.D;Dissatisfaction with our current political system on both the left and right has reached a boiling point when the Landtag voted to pass a law calling for a constitutional convention. Groups of liberals and conservatives have thus gathered in $CAPITAL$ to hammer out a new political vision. Paternalists have argued that extreme measures are necessary to defend against the Danubians, an argument which has failed to gain traction due to the southerners’ stable government. This morning a swath of paternalist delegates stormed out in disgust at the convention’s rejection of their proposals. It is rumored that they may be plotting with sympathetic members of the army to stage a coup d’etat and impose an absolute monarchy led by the charismatic Count Maximilian Erwin von Aroldingen und Eltzingen. If these are in fact just rumors then the main question is whether the liberals, led by author Gunther Rosenberg, will defend republicanism, or whether the conservatives will create a monarchy under Prince Werner von Amsberg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAESCA61.A;The convention is dissolved by the paternalist coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER1.T;The Eidgenossenschaftgespenst;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER1.D;The Confederacy proudly stands as an enduring “alliance” of cantons composed of various entities having greater autonomy in the Reich. Despite such developments, political analysts and observers consider the state as a ‘spectre’, a “Eidgenossenschaftgespenst”, torn apart by years of internal turmoil and meddling by foreign powers that left it in a limbo. Such examples are the Western cantons under Burgundy’s sphere and the Graubunden (Grey Leagues) to the east being a longtime ally of the Confederacy since the 15th century. Despite their nominally independent status, they are considered “associates” with their historically amicable ties with Zurich. Many liberals in the Tagsatzung have argued that a “Swiss” identity is the solution to mend the wounds of our state. With Imperial encroachment on the rise and pan-German radicals at our doorstep, the Swiss must live up to its destiny and best its rivals through wit or by force, lest we succumb to the whims of Great powers or German upstarts in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER2.D;The Western cantons, notably the areas under the jurisdiction of Basel and Fribourg are nominally under the influence of Anvers but are longtime associates of the Swiss Confederacy. After experiencing the carnage of the Great German War, most of its war-weary inhabitants have longed for unity with Zurich fearing that another war would “tear comrades apart and bring upon the never-ending sorrow of mothers.” In a recent plebiscite held in both counties  this year, Bern and Freiburg have voted 97% and 99% respectively to become full-fledged cantons of the Confederation. Despite celebrations erupting in the Confederacy welcoming their new brothers, the jubilant mood is dampened with the fact that Anvers, while still silent on the matter, has the final word on these affairs, and may force “special conditions'' outright that may infringe on our sovereignty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We could offer Zurich the two counties in exchange for “reassurances'', putting the Swiss firmly under our influence, or shall we opt to send in the army with haste before the bill is ratified, rendering the referendum null and void in practice? §RSurely we won’t possibly provoke the locals to engage in radical activity and embolden the revolutionaries in doing the former, right?§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER4.D;The inevitable has begun. The Burgundians, fearing a resurgent Swiss Confederacy giving Bohemia leverage in Alpine affairs, were quick to dispatch the 6eme Corps d’Armee in Geneva to Basel and Fribourg to pressure the counties to reject the bill and block the annexation of these territories. Brawls between the occupiers and locals have begun erupting, with reports of casualties, revolutionary involvement, and even reprisals on both sides. Many of our citizens have derided the government on this affair, which resulted in an upsurge of revolutionary and radical sentiment in the “occupied” cantons and within the Confederacy!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER4.A;We will not forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER5.T;An Offer from Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER5.D;An envoy from Anvers has arrived in Zurich, offering us the “complete” and “absolute” support of the admission of Basel and Fribourg into the Confederacy. In return, the Burgundians have requested “reassurances” from us, urging that we would “stay out” of imperial affairs for an unspecified period of time (and nature) and instead enter security treaties and a customs union with Anvers. While liberal radicals and revolutionaries in the Tagsatzung consider this as an “opportunistic” move and a “betrayal” of national interests, conservatives and the Rheintreue (the pro-Burgundian faction) alike have seen the potential economic prospects with Burgundy appealing, even more so than Prague already did to us for the past hundred years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER5.A;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER5.B;We decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER6.T;The Confederacy Stands Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER6.D;Despite our diplomatic overtures towards the Swiss, it appears that they have outright rejected our most humble and interesting proposal! Of course, we were quick to mete this disgrace with force: we were quick to dispatch the 6eme Corps d’Armee in Geneva to Basel and Fribourg to quell dissent outright and block any attempts of collusion with rogue revolutionaries in Zurich. Despite reports of infighting with perceived ‘insurgents’ aligned with the radical “Helvetic Society'' and brawls with the locals which have resulted in casualties, hopefully we were right in convincing them who is the boss of the Alps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER6.A;If those greedy bankers want to rot with Prague, then so be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER7.T;The Swiss Demand our Annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER7.D;The Swiss Confederacy have requested we abide by the “will of the people”, that is the irrevocable and absolute annexation of $COUNTRY$ to the Swiss Confederacy! That is unless reactionary elements were to immediately storm the town halls and instill that we remain independent and maintain our sovereignty as usual!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER7.A;We welcome our brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER7.B;Oh, look, a bird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER8.T;The Failure of the Graubund;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER8.D;The counter-coup has happened;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER8.A;Oh no…Swissbros…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER9.T;Chaos in the Tagsatzung;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER9.D;The demise of the Holy Roman Empire meant that the calls of German unity have dramatically shaken the foundations of our country to its roots. Despite masses welcoming the end of an era, the dissolution of the old Imperial order brought political instability to the country of the highest levels never seen before, intensified with the fears of famine. The Tagsatzung is on edge, furiously debating and scheming on how the country shall move forward from this abrupt development, be it through subservience with the Burgundians, “unity” with the Danubians pressured by Pan-Germanists in the diet, or the pursuit of further reform - dissolving the Tagsatzung for an National Assembly culminating in the establishment of a full fledged unitary democracy modeled after Etruria. With the dust starting to settle, the final convocation of the Tagsatzung on this day shall decide the fate of the Swiss nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER9.A;We will see what shall become of our fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER10.T;The Nationale Schutzregierung of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER10.D;Many elements of the Landesmiliz in the Aktientheater - the meeting place of the Tagsatzung in Zürich, have been long weary and sick of the hourly tirades that resonated the walls of the building within. This feeling of unease was shattered with a sudden thud from the backside of the building: it appears that a rogue faction of the Army has overrun Zurich, occupying key government buildings without any resistance whatsoever even from the Landesmiliz. This faction, led by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Dufour, a veteran of the Great German War aligned with the Danubian cause, announced their intentions to instill a “military government” in light of the impending Burgundian threat. Despite their noble intentions, they were outed as Danubian loyalists by radicals and revolutionaries alike, conspiring with the Pan-German cause. Order is restored - at the cost of burying the Helvetic dream in the dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER10.A;”Platz machen!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER11.T;The Revolutionary Swiss Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER11.D;The atmosphere inside the halls of the Aktientheater - the meeting place of the Tagsatzung, were more or less unsettling with the hourly tirades that resonated within. The bickering ceased when an official approached the podium, proclaiming that there was a failed “coup attempt” moments ago by pro-Danubian loyalists, thwarted thanks to the efforts of revolutionary militias and city folk in a rare, bloodless struggle. The liberal and revolutionary deputies erupted in jubilation, whilst pro-Danubian conservatives and Burgunders smirked and left in protest. With the support of radicals, liberals and revolutionaries regardless of affiliation, have unanimously proclaimed the establishment of a new, unitary “Revolutionary Swiss Republic'' that shall hopefully carry on Dahlke and the 91ers’ legacy. The beacon of liberty shines on the majestic peaks of the Alps!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER11.A;The voice of the people, the voice of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER12.T;The Natural Conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER12.D;The atmosphere inside the halls of the Aktientheater - the meeting place of the Tagsatzung, were more or less unsettling with the hourly tirades that resonated within. As the chaotic bickering comes to a close in the afternoon, the Aktientheater is filled with gloomy faces, most present from the liberals and the revolutionary delegates. Many were shocked that the Rheintreue and the conservatives have stood out. However as soon as the vote has been delivered, the assembly again erupts into chaos, with the matter at hand devoted to the preservation of the “old order” or the wild prospect from Rheintreue reactionaries and noblemen in giving the title of Duchy of Schweiz bound by “union” with Friedrich III of Baden, noted for his ambitious reactionary zeal and his sympathies with the Jeanist cause in Anvers. In the end only one faction stands out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER12.A;The Rheintreue prevail - establishing the Duchy of Schweiz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER12.B;Maintain the Status Quo - The Confederacy endures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER13.T;The Seizure of Ulm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER13.D;The rapid deterioration of the situation in Ulm, following the collapse of Bavarian authority in their loss in the Donaubrüderkrieg meant that our forces were able to seize the opportunity - instilling order in the city. Despite accounts of bickering from the locals, the occupation was mostly peaceful, and the Mayor of Ulm has announced his loyalties and allegiances to our monarch, ensuring that Ulm will be forever Wurttemberger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER13.A;Another Contender to the Swabian Claim?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER14.T;The Danubian Accord on Ulm, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER14.D;With Ulm crucial to the Danubian cause knowing that will certainly strengthen our claim to the German throne, they have immediately jumped on this opportunity and claimed the lonely “free” city to themselves! With the country being deprived of Imperial immediacy, they are now helpless. With the Emperor’s attention completely divided, there is nobody to stop us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER14.A;A noble ending for a “free” city?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER15.T;Interference from Anvers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER15.D;With the Burgundians firmly entrenched in their prerogative to resurrect the Stem Duchy under the “noble” wing of the house of Bouillon, the Monarch, avoiding war with the bellicose neighbor,  has no choice but to accede to the demands of Anvers, putting the fate of the Swabian project under the machinations of the Jeanist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER15.A;A disgraceful yet necessary agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER16.T;The Proud Torchbearer of the Swabian Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER16.D;The Duchy of Württemberg stood for nearly 800 years as the predominant Catholic hegemon of the Swabian Imperial Circle. it has withstood tumultuous decades of religious strife and internal turmoil. Still, the memory of the Great German War still remains fresh in its citizens, ever weary of Prague’s influence and the revolutionary spirit still lingering. Despite nostalgia for the revival of the old Stem Duchy up nigh, the Swabian Lion must prove itself worthy. The current monarch, Wilhelm I, having witnessed the Coalition Wars tearing his demesne apart, has urged for a more “independent” footing among the other states in the Reich, and from the Burgundian titan as well, at times even fervent to the idea of the revival of a Swabian “Kingdom”. Whatever happens next surely depends on how Prague reacts to the impending maelstrom, which can affect us profoundly in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER16.A;We march into the world, fearless and true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER17.T;A “Revolutionary War” for Swabia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER17.D;War has erupted in Burgundy between the dissenting liberal factions of the Parliament in Anvers and the reactionary royalists devoted to the cause of Jean VI! This is a window of opportunity for us - and as such the National Assembly has convened on the next course of action. The bellicose and radical Pan-German faction insists that we capitalize on this - committing ourselves to a sweeping expeditionary campaign against Württemberg. On the other hand, the non-interventionist Cliques, representing business owners and the old order, sought for neutrality in the conflict. After hours of usual cutthroat debates and tirades on both sides, only the gavel’s pall decides the course of action. §RHowever, we must be wary as a resurgent Württemberg might entail open conflict irregardless of our approach.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER17.A;The Liberals succeed - the National Council gears up for war;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER17.B;The Non-Interventionists proclaim neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER18.T;News from the Swiss Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER18.D;With the Burgundian Civil War still reeling, the inevitable has happened: reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces overwhelming border posts along the $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ border en masse, reminiscent of the tactics seen in the Great German War, even capturing numerous towns along the frontier in the process! The $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army has begun mobilizing its forces to meet the revolutionary bastards in battle. With the Duchy already proclaiming its intentions to resurrect the Stem Duchy once more, it appears that the Swabian Lion is ready to pounce on its enemies to fulfill its destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER18.A;We shall bring these unruly Helvetics to the fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER20.T;The Unterwerfungskrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER20.D;Our ambitions are slowly being brought to fruition! With the outbreak of civil war in Burgundy, they have been rendered powerless in intervening in the affairs of their spherelings. This timing is crucial! With the Swiss rendered vulnerable in the conflict, we can now finally subjugate them once and for all, avenging the setbacks of the Staufers in the XIIth century. This is an opportunity to make our mark and be worthy of the title of “King of Swabia”!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER20.A;We shall bring these unruly Helvetics to the fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER20.B;A land war in the Alps? Probably not worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER21.D;”You still have sons,\nLike St. Jacob saw them,\nJoyfully hasten to the battle.”\n- Excerpt from ‘Rufst du, mein Vaterland’\n\nWe have received reports of $FROM_COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces massing on the frontier, with the sole goal reviving the olden Stem Duchy of Swabia through the outright subjugation of all Swabian states! As fearless the Swabian lion may be, none can fear the forces of brotherhood and fraternity that will smite any foe that dares trespass the free and sacred peaks of the Alps!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER21.A;We’ll make sure that they’ll pay dearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER210.T;The West Alpine War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER210.D;The ongoing chaos amongst the Swabian states has deprived us of foreign protection. This has not gone unnoticed by the Swiss, who have now declared war to force us into their confederation! We must make a stand in the name of cantonal liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER210.A;The mountains shall be their graves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER22.T;The Matter of the Duchy of Baden;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER22.D;Baden is historically one of the most problematic states in the Reich and the German periphery. Sharing a border with the Burgundian behemoth, it always fell victim to the whims of Anvers despite nominally being a part of the Swabian Circle. Their monarch, Friedrich Wilhelm III, despite having sympathies to the Burgundian Crown (and some anti-monarchist gossip tabloids in Germany describing him as a closet Jeanist by heart), is still a threat to be reckoned with and has recently pronounced his support for the formation of Swabia. With the Burgundians still in turmoil with their civil war, it is now high time we conclude the campaign to unite the Swabian peoples into one banner! Let us do it with haste, however, since Anvers may intervene if we act slothful in this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER22.A;$THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ brethren, to battle! For Swabia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER22.B;Its best that we hunker down so as not to provoke the beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER23.T;Burgundy Enforces Peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER23.D;With our war torn country being back in one piece, it is now time that we deal with the Swabian threat. The upstarts have torn apart the Treaties of Zurich, which was formulated in 1821 amidst the War of the 4th Coalition that had stipulations that prohibited any open conflict between any of the states that encompass the former Swabian Circle. Those ambitious opportunists, however, have used the abrupt loss of diplomatic authority to reform the old stem Duchy without any consent from Anvers. We must enforce the Treaties of Zurich and restore order to the unruly states in Swabia, for we cannot allow another threat to meddle in our affairs (and ambitions) in the Rhine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER23.A;The Treaties of Zurich must be enforced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER24.T;Burgundy Demands we Uphold the Treaties of Zurich!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER24.D;With the Burgundian government successfully emerging victorious after their civil war, we were met with reports that the Burgundian military was amassing soldiers to our borders. At the same time, an envoy from Anvers has sent our $MONARCHTITLE$ a word of warning, demanding that we stay true to the 1821 Treaties of Zurich - ceasing all conflicts with our neighbors and rescind all our illegal territorial gains in Swabia! As our armies are no match against the Burgundians, unprepared even, in fighting a two front war, we have no choice but to abandon our claims and uphold the treaties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER24.A;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER25.T;The Swabian Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER25.D;The lands of the former Swabian Circles have always been vital to the fulfillment of the Donaulicherehrgeiz, and for the eventual formation of a unified German state. However the Swabian states were always subject to Burgundian repercussions despite historically being a nominal part of the former Reich. The Hollowing, combined with the upsurge in revolutionary sentiment had further destabilized the area - altering the political landscape in the region tremendously. With Burgundy having recovered from a brief yet chaotic civil war, we can now begin negotiations with the Burgundians on the status of the Swabian states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER25.A;A deal with the devil? Don’t mind if I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER26.T;The Stuttgart Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER26.D;The newly established Süddeutscher Bund, brimming with ambition to fulfill the Donaulicherehrgeiz (Danubian ambition), has set its sights on its unruly western neighbors: the states of the former Swabian Circle in southwest Germany. Not wishing to provoke a costly conflict with Burgundy which still has an immense sway in Swabian affairs and the entirety of Germany still struggling with the effects of the Hollowing, the Danubian government has opted to mediate the issue with the Burgundians in a high profile meeting at Stuttgart.\nAnalysts and observers welcomed the development gladly but remained cautious. They all agree that the result of the conference depends on the allegiances of Swabian states - despite claims from Danubian and Burgundian outlets touting this as a “deal of the century”, open war is still a distinct possibility should either side fail to keep one’s side of the bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER26.A;Hopefully things won't go south;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER27.T;The Stuttgart Conference - The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER27.D;The two behemoths bordering our lands have come knocking at our doorstep. With a resurgent South German Confederation and the Burgundians recovered from their civil war, they have politely approached us to finally mediate the Swabian Question once and for all in Stuttgart. So far, our monarch has longed for a neutral approach to the matter while the pro-Burgundian Rheintreue elite and pro-Danubian conservatives are still at large in the Landtag. The “day of decision” has come, and the following days will decide our country’s destiny - be it either under the Burgundian jackboot or even of neutrality, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER27.A;We must side with the Danubians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER27.B;We shall remain neutral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER27.C;Side with Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER28.T;The Stuttgart Conference - The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER28.D;The two behemoths bordering our lands have come knocking at our doorstep. With a resurgent South German Confederation and the Burgundians recovered from their civil war, they have politely approached us to finally mediate the Swabian Question once and for all in Stuttgart. Despite the tumultuous effects of the Hollowing is, luckily, still intact and in one piece. Our country’s destiny, of course lies on those who handle it, and ultimately their loyalties:;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER28.A;The Schutzregierung pronounces its support for the Bund!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER28.B;The National Council declares neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER28.C;The Rheintreue sides with Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER29.T;The Stuttgart Conference - Burgundian Dominance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER29.D;Our country is now in shambles : despite being nominally independent in the eyes of the world, our current political trajectory means that we are fated for the worst. Despite our best efforts, the $MONARCHTITLE$ is defenseless either to continual Burgundian subversion and influence, or be forced to the fold amidst recent defeats following a disastrous conflict with the Burgundians. We have no choice but to ultimately enter a series of “friendship” treaties with Anvers which will surely cost us our sovereignty in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER29.A;The Rheintreue fanatics finally got their wish…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER30.T;The Stuttgart Conference - Bedingung A.II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER30.D;”The Respective Heads of State of the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Danubian Confederation come in mutual agreement in the matter as follows : With the Swabian situation rendered untenable due to the lack of ‘order’ and ‘discipline’ within the vicinity, a special case shall be laid therewith, that shall instill immediate order to the region with haste. Both parties have reciprocally agreed that a military intervention is in order, seeing that no further negotiation would be possible other than the use of force.”\n\nThe unthinkable has begun. We must now act at once! There is no turning back for the defense of the Swabian cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER30.A;Die Zeit ist nah, Brüder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER31.T;Burgundy Dominant in the Stuttgart Conference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER31.D;With the Stuttgart Conference coming to a close, it appears that the Burgundian delegation has stood overwhelmingly victorious, proclaiming that the entirety of Swabia is now under the “safe hands” of the Burgundians. As an insult, they have asked us to “respect their and the Swabian people’s decision”. The Danubian delegation was outraged, and has since appealed to the King for mediation on the issue! The public is outraged with these developments, demanding that we take action by “taking matters into our own hands”. We shouldn’t be worthy of being called the Danubian Confederation if we couldn’t even liberate the oppressed peoples of Swabia, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER31.A;We can’t openly enter into conflict - Concede.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER31.B;"Respekt?" Als ob! Wir fahren nach Antwerpen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER32.T;The $YEAR$ Conference of Stuttgart - Conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER32.D;The Conference of Stuttgart was brought to a close with beset Danubian diplomats and statesmen leaving Stuttgart and the Burgundian delegation rejoicing in festivities commemorating this occasion well through the night. The Conference has stood out with a resounding victory for Burgundy, effectively making the states of Swabia into one country under Burgundian guidance. The Swabian dream is finally fulfilled - not through sweat or blood, but in an undignified manner, in the halls filled with sniveling diplomats engaging in debauchery, rendering it a dream cursed to its doom -  nowhere else for it to flower up and bloom in the death-ridden forests of Germania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER32.A;The pen has proven itself mightier to the sword for another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER33.T;The Future of Swabia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER33.D;The Conference of Stuttgart was favorable to the Swabian cause, in a way. Celebrations held all around the country commemorating the foundation of a new Swabian Kingdom, but were beset by the fact that the country is essentially deprived of its ambitions set by the agreements formulated by Burgundy and the Danubian Confederation in Stuttgart. Amidst the busy streets, the Landtag convenes once more (under Burgundian guidance) to deal with the matter of Swabian sovereignty: The radical remnants and the liberal faction have together settled for a wholly neutral Swabia while the conservative and pro-business Rheintreu have appealed for a “special status” within the Burgundian crown which would deprive us of all sovereignty and render us subservient to Anvers. After an intense day of debate, the Landtag finally settles on the one bill that would mean life or death for our country:;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER33.A;The Rheintreue succeed in their plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER33.B;The vote is passed - Neutrality is upheld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER34.T;The Future of Swabia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER340.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER340.D;Sûreté de l'État and Rheintreue have managed - in all likelihood through bribery and blackmail - to compel the Landtag to seek Burgundian “protection.” Naturally this has outraged Swabian isolationists who see such measures as little more than deferred annexation. Yet Burgundy has wasted no time in “accepting” the results of the vote. Now a column of Burgundian soldiers is massing on the western border and their commander has requested permission to “expand defensive positions” within our nation. If we permit this then it will mean the end of our sovereignty. If we refuse then it shall mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER340.A;We have no choice…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER340.B;If a single Burgundian soldier sets foot in Swabia, we will shoot him dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER35.T;The Stuttgart Conference - The Swabian Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER35.D;Our efforts in the Congress have been fruitful: Our delegation, along with the Danubians and Swabians, have agreed on the prospect of partitioning the former lands of the Swabian Circle. Many observers have seen this development as an unprecedented yet brief “lull” between German and Burgundian relations never seen before in the region for almost hundreds of years. Many critics of Burgundian foreign policy begged to differ, stating that the Burgundians still have “definite” sway over the course of the negotiations, speculating that the agreement is not entirely fool-proof - furthermore going on to say that “one misstep may lead to war”. Hopefully this will bring lasting peace along the Rhine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER35.A;A ‘compromise’ has been reached?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER36.T;The Danubians Dominant in the Stuttgart Conference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER36.D;Our efforts in the Congress have been met with despair: Our delegation was  shocked to see that the Danubian and Swabian circles have agreed to “collaborate” with each other. “Patriotic” pundits in Anvers have stated this as a provocation for war - as a revitalized German Confederation could lead to a shattering “domino effect” in Germany, urging our people to war and to stop the German threat once more as the fabled “mediators” of Europe. As a response, our delegation has demanded the Danubians to come to terms and agree to a “Swabian Partition” that would ensure the balance of affairs in Swabia and Central Europe. We must expect the Danubians to uphold their bargains!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER36.A;They must agree or else…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER37.T;The Stuttgart Conference - Burgundy Demands Partition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER37.D;Gottlob! Our efforts in the Congress have been met with success! In a fortunate stroke of luck, the Danubian and Swabian delegations have agreed to “collaborate” with each other. Most Danubians welcomed the news warmly - some even going further describing the occasion as an “ideal step for the German dream”. The Burgundians, aghast by the news, were quick to approach us with a ‘compromise’ -  to “partition” the Swabian territories. The Burgundians highly trust us to uphold our bargains - boasting their preeminent weal in mediating European affairs. §RDeclining, on the other hand, would not be a viable option for us as it will irrevocably lead to an open conflict with the Burgundians that will cost us dearly! §!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER37.A;We abide by these terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER37.B;The Danubian Ambition shall not be stopped by mere “compromises”!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER38.T;The Stuttgart Conference - $FROM_COUNTRY$ Demands Annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER38.A;We abide by these terms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER38.B;Auf meinen Arsch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER39.T;The $YEAR$ Stuttgart Conference - The Swabian Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER39.D;The status of the territories of the former Swabian Circle have been subject to countless conflicts throughout its history, dating back to Roman times. Years later, the former Reich under Wenceslaus V attempted to mediate the issue, to no avail, leaving it to be torn apart by the Wars of the coalition in the early XIXth Century.\nThe most recent Stuttgart Conference concluded with an interesting outcome: the Swabian Partition. Under the terms, Burgundy was to assume lordship over the Duchy of Baden. The Swiss Confederation, furthermore, was to be granted “indefinite neutrality” in foreign affairs. Lastly, The Danubian Confederation was to receive direct control over territories on the ‘east’ of Baden, notably the former Duchy of Wurttemberg, the Free City of Ulm and the lone canton of Graubünden. The tense situation in Europe has entered a thaw, and many hope that this development shall enshrine a new age of mutual respect between powers in Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER39.A;Our borders on the Neckar to the Alps are now secure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER40.T;The Stuttgart Conference - An Intervention in Swabia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER40.D;The situation in Swabia has rendered itself untenable. With Bedingung A.II of the Stuttgart Conference in full effect both Burgundian and Danubian delegations have agreed on the restoration of order to the rogue Revolutionary Republic of Swabia. Our Burgundian counterparts have demanded us their “full and unwavering cooperation” in this endeavor - demanding that we partition Swabia upon the war’s conclusion in order to maintain the balance of power in European affairs. §RBe forewarned, refusal would lead to another massive European war with Burgundy and Swabia outright§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER40.A;Agree to the terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER40.B;No compromise with the Burgundians - We’re fine on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER41.T;La guerre Souabe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER41.D;The region of the former Swabian Circle has been subject to countless conflicts throughout its history, dating back to Roman times. Years ago, Wenceslaus V attempted to mediate the issue as part of his centralization and consolidation of the Imperial Estates. This failed and Swabia was left to be torn apart by the early 19th century Wars of the Coalition.\n\nBurgundy and the Danubians, deeming the Swabian situation untenable and refusing negotiations with the “rogue state” of the revolutionary Swabian Republic, have concluded that the Swabian Problem can only be solved by the sword out of fear that the Swabians might otherwise sow the seeds of revolution that ravaged Europe in the early 19th century once more. The revolutionaries in Swabia now prepare to “wave the flag of revolution honorably to the death.” Hopefully this conflict shall end the thousand year struggle in the lands of the Alemanni and settle the matter of Swabia at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER41.A;No quarter shall be given for revolutionary scum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER421.T;Der Große Vaterländische Krieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER421.D;Our country has entered a point of no return. With the perfidious Kingdom of Burgundy and treasonous Danubian Confederation both plotting our demise we have been left with no choice. This is not an excuse to back down, however. The Swabian people, after all, have fulfilled their dream, a dream that they will not relinquish over a mere “Bedingung”. We have achieved freedom!\n\nAll able men are now at arms to the hills and trenches dotting the entire country, bidding farewell to their maidens and mothers, probably for the last time. The rest are at the factories and gunsmiths, or digging the trenches necessary for the Fatherland’s defense.

MGER42.D;With war between Burgundy and the Danubian Confederation on the horizon, our country is split despite our explicit stances of “neutrality” in the impending conflict.

MGER45.T;The Stuttgart Conference - The Danubians Defy Us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER45.D;It appears that the Danubians have failed to see the light. All negotiations had broken down earlier at the conference due to the “tense” and “uneasy” situation that soon followed over the matter of “dividing” the Swabian territories. This is a clear sign that the Danubians government has their own ambitions and machinations for Swabia. Conservatives and Paternalists at the Chamber of Deputies have rebuked this situation, acknowledging that the use of force is preferential to “punish” the Danubians for their “insolence”. The anti-war liberals moderate however have urged restraint, preferring to remain neutral in the conflict and instead focus the governments’ energies on reviving the country from its war-torn state brought upon by the Civil War rather than being involved in a “ potentially costly” and “useless'' war in Swabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER46.T;Victory in the Große Vaterländische Krieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER46.D;We have witnessed the miracle of miracles! Our soldiers, despite their weariness over the tremendous cost of life and the dreary conditions on the front, have erupted in jubilation with the news of an armistice effective at 12:30 in the afternoon. Many have already taken to the streets in many cities, greeting marching columns of Swabian regulars and Waldjäger militias with flowers, hugs and even kisses! The Danubians and the Burgundians were aghast at this development, outright dumbfounded. The Treaty of Baden-Baden was signed on this day, with the defeated powers recognizing the Revolutionary State of Alemannia and allowing trade to be conducted through the lifting of border controls from each respective country. The Swabian people will now sleep easy knowing that they have proven themselves worthy of the title of being the new beacon of freedom in Southern Germany!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER46.A;The sons of the Alemanni have remained true to their duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER290.T;Defeat in the Große Vaterländische Krieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER290.D;Fortune continues to elude us. The Swabian regulars and Waldjäger militias were cut down in the forests and mountains of our homeland by the enemy, and now we all must pay the price of failure. The Treaty of Stuttgart, imposed by the Danubians and the Burgundians, has dismantled our nation. Baden, Wurttemberg, and the Graubund have all been restored, and the resurrected Swiss Confederacy, forced into official neutrality, is the last remnant of our once-revolutionary nation. Swabia returns to what it has been for centuries : a patchwork of buffer states between greater powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER290.A;The sons of the Alemanni are divided once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER370.D;With the Alemannian state smashed to pieces, we have met the Burgundians in Stuttgart to formalize its partition. Ulm Wurttemberg, and the Graubund have all been restored and placed under our influence. Some German nationalists have called our actions treasonous but for now the threat of a Dahlkist resurgence has been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER390.T;The Treaty of Stuttgart;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER390.D;With the Alemannian state smashed to pieces, we have met the Danubians in Stuttgart to formalize its partition. Baden and the Swiss Confederacy have both been restored, the former placed under our control and the latter made officially neutral as a buffer state. Some expansionists have criticized the government for not taking full control of the Swiss as well, but for now the threat of a Dahlkist resurgence has been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER390.A;An acceptable conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER391.T;Le Miracle de la Forêt Noire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER391.D;After a fierce fight with the Swabians we have finally achieved victory. Swabian forces put up a commendable fight with one memorable battle taking place in la Forêt Noire  - the Black Forest. A Burgundian division had to march through the forest, but during the march three regiments got lost. These regiments were then accosted by Waldjäger militias who constantly harassed them and seemed poised to eliminate them. However instead of a repeat of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest these regiments stuck together and found their way back to Burgundy after a week in the forest. This event has encapsulated the spirit of the war in our popular culture and has become known as ‘Le Miracle de la Forêt Noire’. Regardless of what happened we must now handle the Swabian state. Since we are not conquers, the Swabians will have a responsible government installed with us as their protectors against those who would seek their destruction. With this we can secure the southern Rhine border and deny those perfidious Danubians the lands of the Alemanni.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER391.A;Au revoir, Danubiens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER392.T;The Conclusion of the Schwabenkrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER392.D;Despite the veracity of the Swabians and the might of the Burgundians we have triumphed over both of them. The Swabia’s Revolutionary Republic has been dismantled and incorporated into our country and the people of the former Swabia shall be equal citizens to the Danubians. Burgundy on the other hand will receive a lighter punishment and will be forced to recognize this new order in Southern Germany and renounce any interest in the former Swabian lands. With the lands of the Alemanni now under our control, our dream of a united Germany appears to be halfway done, it is only a matter of time before the North joins us as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; #SGF eats Swabia

Yet all of our efforts were in vain and we have lost the war for our independence. However, neither the Burgundians nor the Danubians were able to achieve a decisive victory and have instead seen fit to divide our country amongst themselves. We have no choice but to adhere to their demands and dissolve the Swabian union once and for all. At least we ourselves will maintain  some independence in the Alpines, but our chance to become something greater has now passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER395.D;Despite Burgundy being considered one of the most powerful nations, they have apparently considered the effort of going against us too great and will let us have a free hand in Swabia. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate our victory and plans are already being made to incorporate Swabia into our country. We have shown to all of Europe and especially the Germans what a united German state is capable of. All the remains is extending our hand out to the Swabians and politely, yet firmly, ask them to join their brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; #SGF- Burgundy backs down lets eat the Swabians

MGER396.D;The debate between the Burgundians and the Danubians over us has finally reached a conclusion and that is to let the Danubians have a free hand in our country. The Danubians have decided that our future best lies with us joining their union. With Burgundy out of the picture there is no one who will stand with us against the Danubians if we should refuse. Honestly, most of the population seems excited at the prospects of joining the Danubians and working towards the dream of a united Germany. However we need to ask ourselves is our future a German one or a Swabian one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;; #Swabians have to decide if they want to be eaten by Swabian or put up a pointless defense

Unsurprisingly Burgundy has issued us an ultimatum demanding that we renounce any interest over Swabia and recognize them as being a part of the Burgundian sphere of influence. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ demanding that we confront Burgundy and fight over the future of Swabia. Burgundy may have the stronger army, however the terrain of Swabia favors the defenders, and even if we can stalemate the Burgundian army we may still be able to leverage a favorable peace deal out of it. Granted that all depends on if our military is up for the task. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER398.D;The Danubians have come to their senses and have finally backed down over Swabia in the face of our might. With the Danubians out of the picture we can now extend our influence over the region and ensure that the Swabian government becomes our loyal vassal. We have already sent an envoy with our demands to Swabia, if they are like the Danubians they should also fold to our demands. Otherwise we shall teach them a lesson in what happens when you go against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER399.D;The debate between the Burgundians and the Danubians over us has finally reached a conclusion and that is to let the Burgundians extend their influence over us. A Burgundian envoy has already arrived with a treaty for us that will tie our economic, political, and military under them, effectively making us a vassal of the Burgundians. At the very least we still have some form of self governance, but we will always have to put Burgundian interests first and abandon any hope for further integration with the German region. What shall our reply be to the Burgundian envoy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While the Burgundians have the stronger legal argument for their actions, German nationalists abhor the thought of placing our faith in the hands of a foreign, non-German state.

MGER404.D;”To abandon your shield is the basest of crimes.” - Tacitus, ‘Germania’\n\nSwabia has been divided against itself for centuries, long coveted by surrounding empires. What began as an attempt to unite the region has ended in acrimony, with the Burgundians in the west and the Danubians in the east drawing swords against one another for the fate of the region. The repercussions of the war to come stretch far beyond the Alps or the Schwartzwald. The momentum of German pan-nationalism shall either be accelerated or arrested. While many observers see the war as an inevitable Burgundian victory, the Danubians hold a strong position and may not be easily bested. The future of Germany remains unknown but the next omen of its fate shall be discerned when Swabia once more emerges from the tumult of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus we have met in Konstanz to negotiate an end to our war. The terms of the treaty have ratified the partition of Swabia between Danubian and Burgundian spheres of influence. While this represents an unfortunate setback to our eastern policy we have at least managed to assert our control of the southwestern states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER47.D;Despite our best efforts we could not defeat the Danubians in the field of battle. Likewise the Danubians could not break our army and we have been forced into a stalemate. With tensions over the Swabian lands still high we have been forced to compromise with the Danubians as to what that future should be. After a long debate in the Swabian city of Baden we have finally reached a compromise. The Former lands of Swabia are to be divided between Burgundy and Danubia. The Württemberg region of Swabia is to be governed directly by Swabia, while the Baden region is to be under the guidance of Burgundy. The remaining Swabian territory shall become a neutral and independent country confined to the Alpine mountains. While we may not have achieved all of our goals at least we have gained something from this terrible war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER47.A;At least we have secured the upper right bank of the Rhine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After a long debate in the Swabian city of Zürich we have finally reached a compromise. Swabia shall remain independent and more importantly neutral on the world stage. This will create a large buffer between the Burgundians and the Danubians which should prevent any direct conflict over the upper bank of the Rhine. This isn’t an ideal outcome for us, but at least it gives us some security along our borders for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER49.T;Jean’s Rhenish Project;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER49.D;Recently King Jean has had regular meetings with the Duke of Berg, Frédéric-Guillaume de Jülich. Given that the Duke is Jean’s uncle on his father’s side and the Duke was accompanied by his very young son, Guillaume, it was assumed they were just meeting to talk about family matters. However, word has gotten out that Jean has been pressuring Frédéric-Guillaume to unify the Rhenish states under a loose confederation with Jean assuring the Duke that Burgundy will support the creation of this confederation. This has angered the Parliament as it is the job of the Prime Minister to direct the foreign policy for the country. When confronted about this Jean was reported to say “Correct, the Prime Minister does direct foreign policy, but whatever the Duke does is of his own violation, and we only ask that the Prime Minister supports him.” Unfortunately the Duke is back in Berg and there is nothing that can be done to stop Jean’s Rhenish project. We can only hope they stay pro-Burgundian in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER49.A;What’s the point of even having a Prime Minister?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER50.T;Jean Demands we Unify the Rhein;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER50.D;After what should have been a simple family visit between our Duke, Frédéric-Guillaume, and his nephew the King of Burgundy, Jean VI, our Duke has now come back with plans for a Confederation of Rhenish States. Apparently Jean has pressured our Duke to unify all the Rhenish states under our control as a means to create an effective buffer state in the wake of the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. Jean has also made it clear that while Burgundy will give passive support to the Rhenish project it will not intervene for us and for the sake of Rhenish unity this is something we will have to do for ourselves. For his part at least, Jean’s Confederation might actually be enticing enough to unify the Rhenish territories, but the hard part will be getting everyone together to actually talk about this idea. We will draw up plans to try and present these ideas to our neighbors and hopefully Burgundy will stop interfering with us in these matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER50.A;We are just a cork in the maelstrom of German politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER500.T;The Western Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER500.D;The demolition of the Burgundian monarchy and its replacement by a republican regime is a dire threat to our nation. It is feared that the new Burgundian government may attempt to spread its republican ideas across the Rhenish lands. Fortunately the Duke of Berg has a plan. He will convene a conference of the Rhenish German states in Düsseldorf with the goal of forming a united confederation - not to oppose Burgundy, but to cooperate with them. By presenting himself as the leader of the Rhenish Germans it is hoped that the Burgundians can be convinced to accept him as their ally. It may be a desperate plan but it is better than waiting for Anvers to strike us down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Burgundy has noted this declaration with approval, and will be keeping a close eye on its proceedings. Now we can only hope that the other states of the Rhine are willing to entertain their - our? - plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER53.D;”Our goal must be to avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect” - Frédéric-Guillaume\n\nWith the Duke’s opening speech out of the way he begun laying out the preliminary outline of the proposed Rhenish Confederation. After much debate, and many amendments, it is time for the members to vote on adopting the new Rhenish Constitution. The only roadblock remaining is the vote for the leader of the union, the Prince-Primate. Münster is influential enough that they could run for the position of Prince-Primate, or even try to make their own version of a Rhenish Confederation. However our one ace in the hole hopefully should be Hesse-Nassau as the dynastic relations of the Hesse-Nassau should influence the other states and guarantee us our rightful position. At this point all we can do is wait and see what the members choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER53.A;We’ve done our part, and now it's time to wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER54.T;We Agree with Berg’s Confederation Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER54.D;Only a fool would think that this Conference was Berg’s idea ; Burgundy is clearly the mastermind behind this plan. However, considering the overwhelming Burgundian influence in our country we do not see an issue with going along with the Rhenish Confederation. This arrangement will provide us with both protection from other foreign powers and stability that has been lacking since the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. While this will place Berg above us in terms of power, we will have to recognize this as a cost of joining the Confederation. While we would like to be the Prince-Primate of the confederation there is no way we can overcome the Burgundian influence to become the leader of this Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER54.A;Stability above all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER55.T;We Announce our Candidacy to Lead the Rhenish Confederation ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER55.D;It’s blindly obvious that this conference to make a Rhenish Confederation is just a Burgundian plot to solidify their influence over the region. Berg and Burgundy think that we are just puppets that they can toy with, then they’ve got another thing coming. At this point there is nothing we can do to stop the conference, but we can try to rob Burgundy of their influence over the region by announcing our candidacy to the leading position of the Confederation, the Prince-Primate. We will use our Elbian ties to Bohemia as an alternative to Burgundian influence and if there is enough support then we can take the title of Prince-Primate and bring us under protection of Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER55.A;A German Presence for a German Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER56.T;The Birth of Westphalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER56.D;If Berg believes that we shall blindly follow this Burgundian scheme then they are sorely mistaken. The only reason we were invited is because we lie in the Rhenish area of Germany, otherwise culturally we have more in common with the Northern, Elbian Germans. We have reached out to our friends in Copenhagen and they have informed us that if we were to create our own competing union in the Rhenish area then they will support us. Instead of creating a country with an artificial name like ‘The Confederation of the Rhine’ we shall look to the past and name our union after the old Duchy of Westphalia. Our influence over the greater Rhenish states may be limited, and chances are only Osnabrück may join us, but our existence will at least be a constant annoyance to both Berg and Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The only reason we were invited is because we lie in the Rhenish area of Germany, otherwise culturally we have more in common with the Northern, Elbian Germans. With the sudden loss of Burgundian influence within our nation we now have the freedom to create our own competing union in the Rhenish area. Instead of creating a country with an artificial name like ‘The Confederation of the Rhine’ we shall look to the past and name our union after the old Duchy of Westphalia. Our influence over the greater Rhenish states may be limited, and chances are only Osnabrück may join us, but our existence will at least be a constant annoyance to both Berg and Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER560.A;We’ll create our own Union with Blindhuhn and Himmel und Erde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER57.T;Exporting the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER57.D;When we received notice about this farce of a conference we had no desire to actually partake in this Burgundian ploy. However, this conference does give us a once in a lifetime opportunity. Almost all the leaders of the Rhenish states are cooped up in one place and if we were to capture most, if not all of them, we could bring the revolution to completion and create a unified Republic of the Rhine. With that in mind we have both smuggled in our revolutionaries as diplomatic aides and have made contact with revolutionary groups inside of Berg. During the next meeting our revolutionaries and their allies will launch an attack on the conference in Düsseldorf Castle with the goal of overwhelming both the Duchy of Berg and capturing as many heads of state as we can. This is a risky plan, but by doing this we can seize control of this unification of the Rheinland and repurpose to fit our own plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER57.A;Delightfully devilish, Münster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER58.T;Revolutionaries Besiege the Conference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER58.D;Düsseldorf Castle has come under siege by revolutionaries while the Conference was having a debate on the legislative matters of the Rhenish Confederation. To make matters worse members of the Münster delegation are actively sabotaging the defense of the castle and have even opened the gates to the revolutionaries. At this point the conference members are trapped in the banquet hall while Duke Frédéric-Guillaume tries to organize his royal guard to either fight back the revolutionaries while keeping an escape route open for himself. If the Conference falls, almost all of the heads of state of the Rhenish states will be captured and we will most likely see the rise of a liberal republic instead of our Confederation. Ultimately after a long fought battle the end result was…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER58.A;The Royal Guard fends off the Revolutionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER58.B;The Revolutionaries seize the Conference as the Duke flees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER59.T;Münster Announces their Westphalian Alternative;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER59.D;In an upsetting turn of events Münster has decided to not only withdraw from The Conference of Düsseldorf, but also create their own Rhenish union that they call Westphalia under the protection of Scandinavia. While this may seem like a blow to Rhenish unity the only member that has joined the Westphalian state was the small state of Osnabrück and considering the regions were mostly populated by Elbian Germans, no Rhenish majority areas were lost to us. Not only that but without Münster’s influence, our ascendance to the role of Prince-Primate is now assured. While Burgundy may not be too pleased by these turn of events they should be happy that at least they retain some influence in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER59.A;Annoying but, we don’t need Münster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER60.T;Should We Join Westphalia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER60.D;Münster has decided to create their own Rhenish Union and has asked us to join them. Münster has made it clear that even if we refuse they will still claim our lands as their own. We could try to hold out and see of we can join Berg’s Confederation, however there does not seem to be a viable way for us to remain independent and any attempt to do so may only delay the inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER60.A;We shall join Westphalia §R(ANNEXATION)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER60.B;We refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER61.T;The Vote for the Rhenish Grand Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER61.D;With the The Conference of Düsseldorf wrapping up the only thing that remains is the vote for who will lead the Rhenish Confederation. Due to our dynastic ties we can easily influence the vote to lean towards one side or the other. Many expect that Berg will win and many also expect that we will vote for them. However we could throw a curveball and vote for Münster instead. Doing this would favor Bohemian interests over the Burgundian interests that are backing Berg, however this will only work if Münster is also pro-Bohemian. If we do vote for Münster and they are not pro-Bohemian then our vote will be for naught and whatever happens next is out of our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER61.A;We vote for Berg and Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER61.B;We vote for Münster and the hope of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER610.T;The Westphalian Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER610.D;The Duchy of Berg had once entertained plans to promote itself as the locus for the unification of the Rhenish German states, but the ousting of the House of Jülich from its ancestral lands has put an end to that project. Yet we remain under threat from the Burgundian republican regime, one which shares an interest in spreading its influence eastwards throughout the Rhine. We have reached out to our friends in Copenhagen and they have informed us that if we were to create our own union of the Rhine then they will support us. Instead of creating a country with an artificial name like ‘The Confederation of the Rhine’ we shall look to the past and name our union after the old Duchy of Westphalia. Our influence over the greater Rhenish states may be limited, and chances are only Osnabrück may join us, but our existence will at least be a constant annoyance to both Berg and Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER610.A;Lang lebe Westfalen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER62.T;Frédéric-Guillaume Wins the Vote for Grand Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER62.D;As we have expected, Frédéric-Guillaume has won the vote to become the Grand Prince of the new Rhenish Confederation. The overwhelming influence of Burgundy in the Rhenish region has carried us to this position and with it we shall affirm our loyalty to Burgundy for all the work they have done. All that is left is for the members of the conference to ascend to membership with the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER62.A;As was expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER63.T;Duke Dietrich VI of Münster Wins the Vote for Grand Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER63.D;To our shock and horror the Duke of Münster has won the vote for Grand Prince of the Rhenish Confederation. This can only be the result of a calculated diplomatic play by Bohemia, to influence both Münster and the Hesse-Nassau to their side through what we can only assume was by exceptional foresight. However, there is nothing we can do to stop Münster from taking control of the Confederation as we have bound ourselves towards the creation of the Confederation. Bohemia is already exerting their influence over the new Confederation and any Burgundian influence that was once present in the region is now gone and we are now solidly in Bohemia’s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER63.A;Oh, Jean will hate this bitterly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER64.T;The Rise of the Rhenish Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER64.D;With the success of the revolution in seizing the Conference of Düsseldorf we can now pronounce the creation of a liberal Rhenish Republic independent of both Anvers and Prague. With the capture of so many heads of state we can either strong-arm the remaining Rhenish states to join us or encourage revolutionaries to create governments loyal to us. As for German politics we shall lean on our brothers in Danubia for defense against the old powers and for the hopeful unification of all Germans under one representative government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER64.A;Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER65.T;Shall We Join the Rhenish Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER65.D;For better or for ill, the Conference of Düsseldorf has come to an end and a new Rhenish country has come into existence. As we were a participant in the conference we must now decide whether or not we fulfill our obligations and join this new country. Düsseldorf has made it clear that if we will not join freely then they legally will have every right to incorporate us by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER65.A;It’s time to be a part of something bigger.§R(RGAME OVER)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER65.B;I’d rather not be a part of this monstrosity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER66.T;The Burgundian Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER66.D;We have tried to remain steadfast in our support of the Jagiellons, but the decline of their power within Germany has made this commitment moot. Now it has placed us in grave danger. The Burgundians no longer seek to merely support us - they only desire our submission under their absolute rule! This morning the Burgundian parliament seized upon a minor border incident to declare war, with the intent of transforming $COUNTRY$ into an autonomous part of their nation! We now must fight for our freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER66.A;Zum Krieg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER67.T;The Rhenish Germans Reject our Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER67.D;It appears that the $FROM_COUNTRY$ government has failed to see the light. In hopes that the European Concert would recognize their pleas for independence, they have resisted our generous demands and have chosen to draw swords with us instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER67.A;Then there is only one course of action…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER670.T;The $YEAR$ Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER670.D;The Burgundians and the Bohemians have fought for control of the Rhenish German lands for years. Now matters are coming to a head. This morning we received word of an attempt by a group of Rhenish Protestant fanatics to help the Burgundian Army stage a border incident to justify an invasion! When questioned these delusional men railed against the “Satanic” Bohemians and the Catholic Church, arguing that they wanted to “save the Rhenish people from Papal slavery.” News of this incident has inflamed political tensions across the country, and the Elbian Confederation has already announced its intent to send additional civil and military aid to $COUNTRY$ to shore up our defenses. However Duke Frédéric-Guillaume de Jülich of Berg has publicly accused the government of framing “these brave patriots” and has threatened to lead the secession of Berg proper if the Bohemians attempt to use this as an excuse to take control of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER670.A;What a mess…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER68.T;The Rhenish Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER68.D;Duke Frédéric-Guillaume de Jülich of Berg’s flair for drama is once again causing headaches. We have received word that a group of Rhenish German Protestant zealots dressed in fake Rhenish Army uniforms were recently apprehended by the Rhenish border guard. It seems that they intended to stage a mock battle against several Burgundian soldiers to give our government a pretext to invade the east! We believe that the Duke somehow organized this scheme in an attempt to curtail Bohemian influence within the Rhenish Confederation. Instead the whole affair has outraged the common Rhenish people, with multiple Rhenish newspapers denouncing the Burgundian sympathizers amongst them as anti-Catholic bigots and foreign agents. The Elbian Confederation has announced that it shall increase its military presence in the Rhine region as a result of this affair. Our only option to preserve any Rhenish influence is to force the Duke of Berg to lead the secession of his homeland to keep it out of Bohemian hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER68.A;Berg is better than nothing…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER69.T;The Bohemians Assume Control of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER69.D;The Elbian Confederation has stationed scores of civil and military personnel within our lands in the aftermath of the recent fiasco with the Burgundians. As we feared, the Duke of Berg led the secession of his homeland into Burgundian control. In response the Bohemians have declared that they shall be taking control of our administration for “reasons of security.” With the growth of pan-Germanism and Catholic fervor amongst our people in reaction to the Burgundian loyalists’ subterfuge, there is little chance of resisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER69.A;Perhaps this was inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER70.T;The Rhenish German Submission;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER70.D;Our efforts to apply annexationist pressure upon the Rhenish Confederation have borne fruit. A sympathetic majority has prevailed within the Rhenish Landtag, where they have passed several measures soliciting further civil and military support from $COUNTRY$. This has given us an opportunity to station sufficient personnel within their nation to peacefully install a satellite government in the Confederation. §GOnce the German political arena grows more stable, we will be able to fully integrate the Rhenish Confederation into our own nation.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER70.A;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER71.T;The Crisis of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER71.D;Jean de Bouillon’s Rhenish project seems to be coming to a head. A recent report on the Elbian Confederation’s military has stirred up a wave of anti-Bohemian panic across the Rhenish political elite. More and more people are becoming convinced of two things : first, that the Elbian Confederation is preparing to subjugate us by force, and second, that we shall not be treated as equals within a prospective German nation-state, but instead disempowered and punished for perceived lack of obedience to Prague. Whether or not these concerns are based in reality, a radical pro-Burgundian faction is now attempting to push a bill through the Landtag that would reorganize much of the military along Burgundian lines and court Burgundian investment. If the measure passes then we will likely find ourselves transformed into a Burgundian client state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER71.A;The piper is about to be paid…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER72.T;The Rhenish Submission;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER72.D;Anti-Bohemian sentiment is reaching a fever pitch in the Rhenish Confederation due to several alarmist publications on the rising power and belligerence of the Bohemian military. Many Rhenish citizens have lost faith in Bohemian leadership of Germany and fear the loss of their cultural identity should the Confederations merge. To that end a group of pro-Burgundian politicians have forced through a bill reshaping their military along Burgundian lines and soliciting major Burgundian investments in their economy and institutions. This combined with the general Burgundophile mood sweeping the Rhine will allow us to peacefully install a satellite regime in the Rhenish Confederation. It appears that Jean de Bouillon’s plan to subordinate both banks of the Rhine has finally paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER72.A;It…it actually worked? I mean, of COURSE it worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER73.T;The Looming Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER73.D;We have successfully cast off the shackles of the Altes Regime and established a truly free nation, built upon the foundations laid by the First German Revolution in 1790. Yet unfortunately the Danubians, once hoped to be the beacon of liberal fervor within Germany, have instead succumbed to other political temptations. Thus we stand alone amidst the German people as the bearer of Marinus Dahlke’s legacy. The Burgundians are already marshalling their forces to attempt to force us back into servitude. Let us, then, recall the battle anthem of the German revolutionaries as they marched against the monarchists at Kassel so many years ago!\n\n”Lay the proud usurpers low! Tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty’s in every blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER73.A;”Let us do or die!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER74.T;We Must Save $FROM_COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER74.D;All diplomatic contact has been broken off by the Rhenish government. They have declared our government to be a “den of reactionary vipers” and have stated that any further attempts by $COUNTRY$ to influence their politics will be taken as an act of war. Clearly the Rhenish institutions have been overrun by unchecked Dahlkism! We must free the Rhenish German people from their tyrannical regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER74.A;They shall surely welcome us as liberators!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER75.T;The Burgundian Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER75.D;Burgundy has been seeking to push all of the greater Rhenish basin into one confederation for years. Now they have deemed our existence an obstacle to that goal - one which they intend to remove. This morning a minor border incident occurred between a Burgundian patrol and some Westphalian militiamen. Such affairs have been swept under the rug by both of our governments in the past but this time the Burgundian government has seized upon the event to declare war! We must now fight to protect not just our independence but the future of Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER75.A;Zum krieg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER76.T;The End of Westphalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER76.D;With Westphalia defeated and occupied, we may now integrate its lands into the Rhenish Confederation. As Westphalia was a rather artificial nation to begin with it is hoped that there will not be much sentiment around seeking its revival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER76.A;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER77.T;The Danubian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER77.D;The Danubian government’s well-known raison d’etre is the unification of Germany, and they have for years been pressuring us to join their nation. Now they have presented a final ultimatum : Accede to annexation or face invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER77.A;We must bow to the inevitable and spare our people war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER77.B;Never! We shall fight for our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER78.T;The Danubian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER78.D;The Danubian government’s well-known raison d’etre is the unification of Germany, and they have for years been pressuring us to join their nation. Now they have presented a final ultimatum : Accede to annexation or face invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER78.B;Never! We shall fight for our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER79.T;The Danubians Demand Bayreuth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER79.D;The dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth by Emperor Sigismund V, and the subsequent Burning of Nuremberg by the Reichsarmee, was always a bitterly unpopular action amongst the Danubian Germans, who saw it as a direct betrayal given their cultural connections to Bayreuth. Now that they have become united, they seem poised to seek revenge. After previously having sought to use agitators to foment a pan-German nationalist uprising against the Bohemian garrison in Bayreuth, they have now turned to more direct measures. We have received an ultimatum from the Danubian government : Evacuate all civil and military personnel from Bayreuth immediately, or else they will regard any attack upon Scandinavia by ourselves in the future as an attack upon $FROM_COUNTRY$ as well. We should seriously consider if Bayreuth is worth a prospective two-front war when the time comes to liberate Pomerania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER79.A;We cannot afford any distractions - remove all troops from Bayreuth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER79.B;Ignore this pathetic attempt at blackmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER80.T;Bohemia has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER80.D;The arrogant Bohemians have rejected our petition for the liberation of Bayreuth. We now know that only force will separate the despoilers of Nuremberg from their ill-gotten gains. It is thus fortunate that we have reason to believe that $FROM_COUNTRY$ will, in the near future, be drawn into a major war with Scandinavia, which should give us the opportunity to free Bayreuth from them while their attention is elsewhere. Of course, if for some reason the Czech sections of their citizenry were to seize control of the state, then we would also have a mandate to step in and safeguard Bayreuth. One way or another we will have our revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER80.A;There will be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER81.T;A Golden Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER81.D;Bohemia has become entangled in a war with Scandinavia, turning their attention northwards. This is the perfect chance to make good on our prior threats and liberate Bayreuth! If we do not strike now, while we have the chance and their guard in the south is lowered, then we may never have a suitable opportunity again. §RIf we hesitate now and Bohemia emerges from their war victorious then Bayreuth shall surely be out of our reach for the foreseeable future.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER81.A;Now comes the reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER81.B;We are simply not ready to face Bohemia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER82.T;The Danubians Invade Bayreuth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER82.D;We had feared that we had not heard the last of the Danubian Germans when we rejected their impertinent demand for Bayreuth. Now the rogues have made good on their threat to plunge a knife into our back by invading the region during our war against Scandinavia! Sadly our prior political commitments to Bayreuth’s protection mean that we cannot temporarily evacuate the area and then reclaim it at a later date. We must face the Danubians here and now and remind them that, while the Empire may have passed away, we remain the sole master of Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER82.A;Death to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER820.T;The Sorrow of Old Wurzburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER820.D;The Archbishopric of Wurzburg’s continued existence is due solely to the Congress of Paris in 1820. Its population is over two-thirds Protestant yet they are governed by a Catholic theocracy. In the past the Empire was able to provide enough support to keep order within Wurzburg but its dissolution has placed us in dire straits. Many are calling for the Archbishop to secularize the realm and appoint the Burgundian Count Emanuel de Montbéliard of Alsace, whose family holds an old claim to Wurzburg, as its new ruler. If the Archbishop does not end theocratic rule then the result will almost certainly be revolution, given the unrest which continues to simmer across Wurzburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER820.A;It’s all because of that damned Zwingli!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER83.T;The Wurzburg Riots ;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER83.D;A group of Wurzburg City liberals recently organized a protest outside of the local tax office, declaring that they would no longer pay what amounted to a tithe to the church of a religion which neither they nor the bulk of the common Wurzburger people believe in. When the city guards were summoned to disperse the protest, dozens of citizens flocked to the liberals’ defense, inciting a much broader campaign of insurrection. Now the whole of the capital is awash with anti-clerical rioters and the only thing which might prevent the complete collapse of the nation, or worse, the establishment of a radical republic, is an immediate abdication by the Archbishop and the invitation of Count Emanuel to rule instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER83.A;Death to the tyrant priest! Long live the free Wurzburger people!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER83.B;We bow to no master but the Lord God and His Holiness the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER83.C;The time has come to cede all temporal authority to a secular government.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER84.T;Looming Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER84.D;The presence of a powerful, pan-German state on our borders has driven the republican coalition into a terrible division. All government business after the abolition of the theocratic regime has ground to a halt due to rancorous debates between pan-Germanists and Wurzburger nationalists. It is all but guaranteed that said neighbor is boosting their supporters within Wurzburg to promote annexationist sentiments. Our government cannot hold itself together for much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER84.A;Calamity!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER85.T;Loss of Burgundian Support;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER85.D;The cession of Burgundian aid and assistance to our government has opened the door to political chaos. Duke Emanuel I has proven to be a rather aloof sovereign, far more ignorant of German culture than expected and caring little for the day-to-day governance of the nation. Without Burgundian support to keep the government humming along, this lack of direction by the sovereign and his administration has allowed local governments to claim more and more power. At this rate our nation may well disintegrate before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER85.A;Calamity!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER850.T;The Frankish Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER850.D;The Frankish state has turned its sights upon us. They have demand our annexation to “secure the unity of all Franks.” Whatever their excuses we have little means of resisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER850.A;So be it…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER86.T;The Collapse of Wurzburg ;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER86.D;Wurzburg, one of the Congress of Paris’ many aberrations, has crumbled beneath the weight of modern political movements and its own contradictions. The power of the Catholic Church has been smashed yet no viable secular government has arisen in its place - attempts to install Count Emanuel of Alsace as Duke of Wurzburg had foundered on the rocks of the Count’s own apathy towards our culture and our administration. In light of the government’s escalating paralysis, local communities have turned to neighboring realms for support, and the inevitable conclusion of this process is our disintegration.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER86.A;Wurzburg is Wurzburg no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER87.T;The Collapse of Wurzburg;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER87.D;The former Archbishopric of Wurzburg was a mistake of the Congress of Paris in 1820, a Catholic theocracy ruling over few Catholics and many Protestants. Anticlerical elements within Wurzburg attempted to court Burgundian support for its continued survival but this failed to check the erosion of its institutions. Now Wurzburg has collapsed and several communities formerly part of its territory have turned to us for guidance, petitioning us for annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER87.A;We won’t leave them helpless - of course we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER88.T;An Ultimatum from $FROM_COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER88.D;The nation of $FROM_COUNTRY$ has refused to recognize our independence, instead demanding that we submit to their rule! Sympathetic pan-German nationalists have already begun to agitate for our annexation into their own country. If we do not fight for our liberty then we shall surely lose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER88.A;It is futile, we must accept our role within the greater German destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER88.B;We will defend our freedom to the last breath!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER89.T;An Ultimatum from $FROM_COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER89.D;Scandinavia’s presence within our nation has declined precipitously, in part due to their loss of Hamburg. Now $FROM_COUNTRY$ has refused to recognize our independence, instead demanding that we submit to their rule! Sympathetic pan-German nationalists have already begun to agitate for our annexation into their own country. If we do not fight for our liberty then we shall surely lose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER89.A;It is futile, we must accept our role within the greater German destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER89.B;We will defend our freedom to the last breath!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER90.T;The Shifting Winds in Bremen;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER90.D;Our loss of Hamburg has drastically reduced our power projection within northwestern Germany. Nowhere is this felt more acutely than in Bremen. While we have occupied the city-state for years, the cost of maintaining our garrison within Bremen has now risen too high for our government to be able to justify. Furthermore the old Nordic loyalists whom we once leaned on for Bremener political support have steadily lost ground, either to local-minded politicians or to pan-German nationalists. As a result we have been forced to shutter our Bremener barracks and withdraw all Scandinavian military personnel. It is likely that a larger German power will seek to fill the resulting political vacuum…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER90.A;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER91.T;Pacifying the Rhineland;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER91.D;Our Rhenish territories remain in disorder. They are clinging to outdated laws and customs which are deplorable relics of a bygone era. If we want to preserve the stability of our eastern frontier then we must take a stronger role in their governance. A new bill has been drawn up to officially designate the eastern Rhineland as a special region within $COUNTRY$ proper, annexed on paper but maintaining a closely monitored “autonomous” government to prevent unnecessary disruptions. The only question is whether such directives are necessary or if we should focus on preparing them for eventual full annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER91.A;A necessary step on our path to glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER91.B;A waste of time, we will absorb them soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER92.T;Pacifying Swabia;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER92.D;Our Swabian territories remain in disorder. They are clinging to outdated laws and customs which are deplorable relics of a bygone era. If we want to preserve the stability of our eastern frontier then we must take a stronger role in their governance.

MGER93.T;The New Burgundian Order;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER93.D;The Burgundian government has reorganized our nation to better suit their interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER93.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER94.T;Lingering Concerns in Swabia;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER94.D;Swabia remains unaligned with our own institutions. While few doubt the wisdom of our leader, growing voices within the ruling party are questioning our laxity regarding Swabia’s state of affairs. The excuse used by the leaders’ loyalists, that the international situation was too delicate to make such aggressive moves in the eastern frontier, has quietly but consistently been questioned by our nation’s elites. §RIt would be wise to take action to subordinate Swabia, sooner rather than later.§;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER94.A;Some people are never satisfied…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER95.T;Lingering Concerns in the Rhineland;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER95.A;Some people are never satisfied…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER96.T;The German Question;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER96.D;Western Germany is ostensibly under our protection but its current status is unsuitable for continued peace and prosperity in the region. The situation is delicate enough that the administration has decided not to heed the demands of jingoists who demanded the overthrow of the current Rhenish or Swabian governments and their replacement with autonomous Burgundian governors. While we have not abandoned our goal of securing our eastern border, we must seek other solutions beyond that of pure force.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER96.A;Honey, not vinegar.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER97.T;Burgundy Forces an Oldenburger Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER97.D;For years Duke Hans of Oldenburg has resisted pressure from Anvers to adopt a Burgundian-written constitution that would limit his authority and empower the Oldenburger Landtag. This was once possible by citing his obligations to the Emperor to preserve Imperial law from foreign disruption. However the Empire’s death now renders that excuse moot and so the Duke has no other option but to accept this constitution. While the Oldenburger people are excited by the expansion of civil rights and democracy, neither the Duke nor any of the Great Powers in this corner of Europe are pleased by Burgundy’s unilateral actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER97.A;We do what we must…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER98.T;Schloss Oldenburg under Siege!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER98.D;For years Duke Hans of Oldenburg has resisted pressure from Anvers to adopt a Burgundian-written constitution that would limit his authority and empower the Oldenburger Landtag. However the consolidation of the Rhenish Confederation has sparked a wave of Burgundian-inspired reformism across northwestern Germany, and that tide has now reached us. The Duke awoke this morning to find crowds of angry Oldenburgers assembled outside of Schloss Oldenburg, demanding a constitution! Several nobles, who had been staying at the castle after a recent party, have demanded the Duke use this opportunity to purge the Burgundophile reformists. If the Duke caves in to the protestors then Burgundy is likely to assume control over Oldenburg in the future. Of course there is a third option : try to send a message to the Scandinavian garrison in Bremen and ask them to intervene. Yet this could lead to exchanging one potential master for another.;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER99.D;For years Duke Hans of Oldenburg has resisted pressure from Anvers to adopt a Burgundian-written constitution that would limit his authority and empower the Oldenburger Landtag. However the consolidation of the Rhenish Confederation and the rise of Westphalia has sparked a wave of liberalism across northwestern Germany, and that tide has now reached us. The Duke awoke this morning to find the city in the throes of a pro-Westphalian revolution seeking to join Oldenburg with the southern Radicalists! If the Duke rallies the monarchists to restore order then Burgundy’s growing power in the region will likely lead to them assuming control of us in the future, but might that be preferable to a meeting with the fallschwertmaschine?;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER103.T;Closure of the Oldenburg Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER103.D;With the loss of Hamburg, maintaining our presence in Oldenburg has become a difficult logistical feat, not to mention expensive. Our declining influence within northwestern Germany has given the Oldenburg head of state the opportunity to issue an edict closing the Scandinavian barracks in his realm and ordering all Scandinavian military personnel out of the country. We have no choice but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER103.A;Ungrateful wretches.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER104.T;A Strongly Worded Letter from Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER104.D;The Burgundian ambassador delivered a disturbing memorandum to our head of government this morning. It opened by expressing its gratitude for Scandinavia’s “continued cooperation in our maintenance of peace and security in northern Europe,” but then diverted into a demand that we withdraw all forces from Oldenburg! Burgundy now regards the city-state as within their sphere of influence and feels threatened by our presence there. The memorandum has made it clear that if we refuse, it will mark the termination of our alliance. It closed by urging us to “understand the necessities imposed upon the Burgundian government due to reasons of national security.” If we accept then Oldenburg’s annexation into the Rhenish Confederation is all but certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER104.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER104.B;Anvers thinks that they can dictate our affairs to us? To Hell with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER105.T;Thunder of a Danubian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;; 
MGER105.D;Our defeat at the hands of the Radicalist regime in Alemannia has plunged our humble nation into turmoil. The people are outraged at the failure of the aristocracy and the other elites to lead the way to German unification as they had promised, and liberal sentiments are rising with feverish speed. Republicans throughout $COUNTRY$ have denounced the current government as doomed - if it cannot defeat Alemannia, they argue, how could it hope to stand up to the foreign powers keeping Germany divided? Therefore they are demanding unification with the Alemannian Radicalists and the abolition of the nobility…by force if necessary. The Danubian Army is already taking sides between republicans and monarchists and if we don’t order our loyalists to attack the traitors in their midst then a coup is certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER105.A;Sweep the aristocracy into the ashbin of history!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER105.B;We will fight these rebel scum in the streets, in the mountains, everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER106.T;The Danubian People Plead for Our Leadership!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER106.D;Our defeat of the decadent aristocrats in the Danubian Confederation have awakened its people to the light of republicanism. A revolution has broken out, with the old order torn from its throne and Radicalism elevated in its place. Given our previous victory, the new provisional Danubian government has offered to unify with us! They have made it clear that this would entail Alemannia taking the reins of the nation and not the other way around. This would place all of southern Germany under our authority! Shall we join in brotherhood with our eastern comrades?;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER106.A;Ja! We will unite Germany through liberty, equality, and fraternity!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER106.B;Nein, we prefer to have good relations with the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER107.T;The New Danubian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER107.D;Alemannia’s triumph over the Danubian Confederation has shattered the south-easterners’ confidence in their nobility and driven them to revolution. Radicals overthrew the monarchy and petitioned the Alemannian republicans to unite with their nation. A conference was quickly convened in the city of Ulm to draft a new constitution for the resulting state. The result was the emergence of a somewhat more centralized - and thoroughly republican - Danubian Federation, stretching across southern Germany with its new capital in Ulm as a compromise between the westerners and the easterners. The Alemannian Radicalists have now not only won their liberty but united the Hochdeutsche at the stroke of a pen. Crowned heads across Central Europe feel a pang of shock shoot through their hearts, as the bastion of Radicalism in Germany grows even stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many pan-nationalists see Bohemia as an unquestionably German state, a fact supported by the continued dominance of its German-speaking population over the Czechs. However there are those who fear international reaction from such an aggressive claim - not to mention the introduction of so many Slavs into Germany - and would prefer to only claim Upper Silesia. Still others see Bohemia as irreversibly corrupted by Slavic decadence and wish to focus on more pressing matters. §RSeveral neighboring states have declared that any attempts by Germany to completely annex Bohemia would be unacceptable.§;;;;;;;;;;;;

MGER110.T;The Conference of Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER110.D;With the establishment of a unified German state, the question of a “Greater Germany” - a Germany encompassing Dietsland - has emerged. It is true that pan-Germanism is a strong force within our nation, and a conference in Amsterdam has been organized at the behest of the German government in the hopes of determining the terms by which Dietsland might accept unification with them. However, a growing number of Dutch people believe that we should not sacrifice our hard-won sovereignty for the sake of Germany, a “nation” from which we have been estranged for centuries. Furthermore, the tide of radicalism has been sweeping Germany as of late, and its political landscape has undergone frightful transformations. We may not want to take part in the Germany which has emerged…but this “Conference” is not a mere diplomatic gesture. It is a threat : if we do not acquiesce to annexation, then Germany may seek it through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER110.A;We will make the necessary sacrifices for the German people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER110.B;Germany is not our homeland any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER111.T;Failure of the Amsterdam Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER111.D;The Dutch have refused German unity! They have declared that Dietsland and the Dutch people have their own destiny to follow, and have repudiated the “Greater Germany” ideal of union with ourselves. While pan-German fervor has not abadated amongst our own people, it appears that Dutch nationalism has prevailed in Dietsland. If we want to secure the Dutch then force is our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER111.A;We will be back in Amsterdam sooner rather than later…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER740.T;The Rhine Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER740.D;To the horror of our government, the Rhenish Confederation has defied our attempts to bring them under our control. Be it through outside interference or incompetence on the part of the Burgundian armed forces, the right bank of the Rhine remains beyond our reach. This cannot be tolerated! Thankfully Berg remains ardently pro-Burgundian, allowing us to foment a pro-Burgundian uprising which will allow us to place the region under occupation. Yet we must now remain more vigilant than ever, for the peoples of the Rhine shall surely look upon us with suspicion and hostility going forwards…;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER740.A;This is…not an ideal situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER741.T;Berg Secedes!;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER741.D;The peoples of the Duchy of Berg, especially their elites, have refused any cooperation with $CAPITAL$. This den of Burgundophile vipers has refused to break ties with Anvers. Now they have gone even further and declared independence! The Burgundians immediately dispatched troops over the Rhein to “protect” Berg. Thankfully, Burgundy has not made any additional moves to challenge our independence. The loss of Berg is a bitter blow, but at least now we are free from Burgundy’s clutches.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER741.A;A reckoning is not to be denied forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER742.T;Establishment of the Berg Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER742.D;Our forces entered Berg as soon as they declared independence from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Now Berg has become our protectorate, granting us at least a small foothold on the right bank of the Rhine. Yet it has come at the cost of outraging $FROMCOUNTRY$, who have denounced Berg’s secession as illegal and have sworn to recover Berg by any means necessary. Suffice to say any hope of peacefully establishing our hegemony over the Rhine has now been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGER742.A;At least we have Berg…;;;;;;;;;;;;
#German Overhaul Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_2GGW_title;Declare a Reichsexekutionskrieg against the Danubians;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_2GGW_desc;Ever since Imperial authority began to decline after the Great Interregnum of the mid-thirteenth century, it has at times been necessary to declare a Reichsexekutionskrieg, an official war against one of our own Imperial Estates to enforce a decision of the Reichshofrat (Aulic Council, the supreme court of the Empire). As this is a breach of the Ewiger Landfriede, the ban on internal Imperial wars, it is not done lightly, especially in the modern era where the memory of Wenceslaus V’s centralization campaigns are so fresh. Furthermore, Reichsexecutionskriegs were disavowed under Article III of the Treaty of Paris of 1820, as part of the conditions allowing the Jagiellons to keep their titles. Yet the threat posed by the dissident, even traitorous princes of the Danubian Circle, particularly their support of German nationalism, can no longer be ignored.\n\n§RWe can strong-arm the Reichshofrat and the Reichstag into declaring a Reichsexekutionskrieg against Austria and Bavaria, but only at the cost of becoming the enemy of Europe. This will without question provoke a new Great German War.§;;;;;;;;;;;;

However the Scandinavia naval presence makes it almost impossible to invade the heartland of Scandinavia so we should push for peace now.

FAKE_form_SGF_title;The Danubian Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;
FAKE_form_SGF_desc;For far too long we have been pushed around by Prague and have been kept in line only by the threat of force by the Imperial Army. Despite the Holy Roman Empire existing for over a thousand years it is a fractured mess and a playground for outside powers to exploit. That is why the idea of Danubia exists, in order to transform a mere legal territory of the Empire into a champion of the German states, and to pave the way for the inevitable German unification\n\n(NOTE: Danubian unification will be handled through events - this just serves as a reminder of the on-going unification).;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is time for the occupation to end and our nation to regain full control of our sovereignty.

FAKE_form_CAE_BOH_title;The Elbian Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;
FAKE_form_CAE_BOH_desc;Due to our previous position as the heart of the former Holy Roman Empire we are in a prime position to try and make inroads towards a greater German state, uniting the northernmost former Imperial Circles with the Bohemian crown lands. However, we will need to accomplish two things. First we must solve the political crisis in Bohemia following the end of the Holy Roman Empire by completing the Great Reforms. Second we must unite the Elbian Germans by identifying a common threat that they will rally around us to protect them from. (NOTE: this event is just to lay out what must be done. Actual Elbain unification will be handled by another event.);;;;;;;;;;;;

We have heard of second-hand stories about the murder of German citizens by Scandinavian soldiers in Hamburg sometime around the beginning of the 19th century, but nothing concrete has been proven. If we were to look more into this matter and find (or…”find”) actual evidence, we could use this to rally the Northern German states to our cause and also use it to launch a war to free the Germans trapped under Scandinavia’s direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Berg was successful in unifying the Rhenish Germans under a single state, but our administration has concluded that in order to better secure our interests we should step in and relegate the country to a puppet state. Hopefully the Rhenish Germans will be accommodating to our demands, since otherwise we may have to intervene directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HOLY_ROMAN_EMPEROR;Emperor of the Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOLY_ROMAN_EMPEROR_desc;The Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation is in theory the master of Central Europe. In practice he only controls the Lands of the Crown of Bohemia. The Emperor exercises little control over his vassals and many instead follow the orders of Anvers or Copenhagen. However, the title does confer many privileges upon the Emperor which have greatly benefited our country and the House of Jagiellon. While still a prestigious position, the Emperor's power is slowly eroding away and soon the position may become completely defunct.;;;;;;;;;;;;

### Holy Roman Empire as Coded by Attalus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE1.T;Vereinigung des Heiligen Römischen Reichs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE1.D;After almost a thousand years, the legacy of Karl der Große, the so-called ‘Father’ of Europe has left a profound mark on Western & Central Europe. Despite centuries of discord and strife that followed after, his legacy endured even in the disastrous XIXth century that saw the near dissolution of our institutions from the Dahlke’s scourge and the so-called “Great Powers” that threatened to rip our demesne apart.\nBut alas! The dust has settled, with many of Germany’s princes brought to the fold through negotiation or by force. The Reich is now complete. However, the Reichstag and the pro-military Geheimrat are still at odds on the matter of executive Imperial power, with the former backing constitutionalism while the latter seeks to entrench power in the hands of the Emperor. In the end, as always, the Emperor has the final say. After an intense night of contemplation following solemn ceremonies at the Prager Reichschloss, he inevitably writes down in his diary what could be one of the decisive moments of the Empire, and perhaps even his life:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE1.A;”...Too much power alone corrupts - it shall be given to my subjects, esteemed servants of the Reich...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE1.B;”All I have done to preserve the Empire - it is MY destiny, from MY achievement alone - MY Reich…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE2.T;The $YEAR$ Convocation of the Reichstag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE2.D;While the new Reichstag has convinced most of the Imperial elites of the goodwill of the Emperor, it will have to significantly reform the state if the Empire wishes to survive. The Reichstag is still firmly divijded on the matter of the §RDie Aushöhlung§, for the Republican hydra feeds upon the misery of the masses. However, the Army is still a patchwork of the various princely forces, the economy still bound by various tariffs and different scales and the Empire is hardly supported by the Intelligentsia. Until all those are resolved, the Holy Roman Empire will hardly be able to wield its power in Europe and perhaps, all over the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE2.A;We stand firm amidst all adversity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE3.T;The Imperial Capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE3.D;With the Empire now solidified thanks to Sigismund declarations, the time has come to select a new Imperial capital. Prague has served the Jagiellons well, but keeping the court here would only strengthen the arguments by German nationalists and Republicans that the Empire is still a Bohemian project first and foremost. Three candidates have been identified : Frankfurt of course was the city where all Jagiellon emperors were crowned following their elections, and while the memories of the Revolution still endure, placing the capital here will help strengthen the unity of the German nation. Meanwhile Nuremberg has hosted the Imperial Regalia since the Hussite wars, and the tragic fire of 1839 makes the city perfect for a new urban plan fitting for the Imperial capital. Meanwhile Regensburg was the city where the Reichstag was hosted permanently since the XVIIth century, and choosing the city would prove the continuity of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE3.A;Frankfurt, the heart of the German nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE3.B;Nuremberg, to heal the wounds of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE3.C;Regensburg, the confirmed seat of the Reichstag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE4.T;The Problems of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE4.D;The Unification of the Empire has proven harder than what we envisioned. The North has suffered particularly from the Hollowing and the latest war, with the agriculture disrupted once more and the Elbians looking for better opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile the Industrial cities of the Rhine were deeply linked with Burgundy, urban misery is thus common as factories closed and the industrialists unsure of our new policies. To top these two problems, the Empire remains a patchwork of different entities that hardly work together : the bishoprics are protected by the Papacy while commonly hated by their subjects, the Free Cities and the Swiss Confederation hardly adhere to the Monarchy while the Great Princes of the Empire hardly bow to the Imperial Recesses and the acts of the Diet. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE4.A;The real work begins now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE5.T;The Political Clubs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE5.D;One of the important changes of the latest Imperial constitution was the guarantee of freedom of expression and association. While originally demanded by the princes and the aristocracy to avoid censorship and autocratic power, it has also empowered various political clubs in the common classes. While Republicans are still forced to go underground by various political suppression policies, Gesellschaften der Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit (Friends of the Liberty and Equality clubs) have flourished in nearly all important cities of the Empire, while “Hermannssöhne”, in reference to Arminius, the legendary Germanic chief who defeated the Romans, have mostly focused on riling up the minds of disgruntled peasants and soldiers. While some have already been suppressed because of Republican speeches heard by police agents in infiltration, the task of suppressing all of those clubs would be too arduous for our state at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE5.A;We can only hope they remain unimportant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE6.T;The Relief Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE6.D;”Seven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, deserved less consideration than the lowest of them...The horrid scenes I then witnessed I shall take to my grave. The wailing of women - the screams and terror of children - the speechless agony of honest men - wrung tears of grief from all. The landlords in a circle all around warned their tenantry, with threats of direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night's shelter” - Pastor Hans Kasper\nThe consequences of §RDie Aushöhlung§ continue to weigh heavily on the Empire, and the Liberty and Equality clubs have organized a petition to be signed by all their members in the whole country to be sent to the Reichstag to take action against §RDie Aushöhlung§ and especially the entrenched and unflinching aristocracy with their old ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE6.A;The issue is complicated, the Reichstag will act in due time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE7.T;Krieg um Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE7.D;”When a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted, you must shun him on the roadside when you meet him, you must shun him in the streets of the town, you must shun him at the shop-counter, you must shun him in the fair and at the marketplace, and even in the house of worship. You must shun him with your detestation of the crime he has committed. If the population of a county in Germany carry out this doctrine, that there will be no man who would dare to transgress your unwritten code of laws.”- Wolfgand “Hermann” Keitel, head of the Hermannssöhne in Oldenburg\nThe lack of action by the Reichstag on the Hollowing issues has led to an increase of actions by political clubs and parties throughout Germany : boycotts, demonstrations against evictions, destruction of aristocratic properties have multiplied in what militants call the “Land War”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE7.A;We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE8.T;Republican Outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE8.D;"The people are beginning to fear that the Imperial Government is merely a machinery for their destruction... that it is unable, or unwilling, to take a single step for the prevention of famine, for the encouragement of manufactures, or providing fields of industry, and is only active in promoting, by high premiums and bounties, the horrible manufacture of crimes!"- “Die Frankfurter Zeitung”\nThe recent reform of the Reichstag has enraged the Republicans throughout the country who consider that the failure to act upon the misery of the campaigns shows the unwillingness of the government to go against the Landlords and the aristocracy power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE8.A;It is difficult, you know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE9.T;The Relief Petition Returns to the Reichstag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE9.D;”Unto the Honourable Reichstag of the German Nation assembled, the Petition of the undersigned, their suffering countrymen, That we, your petitioners, dwell where merchants are noted for enterprise, whose manufacturers are skilled, and whose workmen are proverbial for their industry. The land itself is goodly, the soil rich, and the temperature wholesome ; it is well suited for commerce ; it has numerous, convenient harbors ; in facility of internal communication it is peerless…Yet with all these advantages, and with every disposition and capacity to exploit them, we find ourselves overwhelmed with public and private suffering.” - Beginning of the Relief Petition\nOnce more the Clubs have organized a demonstration in $CAPITAL$ to bring a petition signed by more than 1 million Imperial subjects - or so they claim. The Reichstag has accepted the petition but has refused to table it for debate until more “pressing issues” are dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE9.A;The people will understand surely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE10.T;The Banquet Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE10.D;After the Relief Bill demonstration, rumors abound among the crowd that huge shipments of food had been seen going to the Imperial Palace. Rumors were confirmed by agents within the Palace that the Emperor was hosting the various ambassadors in Europe with a huge banquet to celebrate the new pregnancy of his wife. While state decorum may be important and understood even by the beggars, the news of this debauchery of food and luxuries while the plight of the German people went unheard electrified the crowd who took to the streets and soon began to overwhelm the police and the military forces in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE10.A;”Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE11.T;Riots in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE11.D;The Chaos that followed the Banquet riot did not stop after a few hours. Citizens of the capital joined with whatever weapons they could find and began to requisition all guns and arms from depots they stormed. Sigismund had already fled when the rioters crossed the gates of the palace while trampling the bodies of the White Guard as did many of the members of the Reichstag when a woman delegation broke into the Reichstag building to demand a direct vote on the Relief Bill. The situation has yet to calm in the Capital as everyone wonders what will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE11.A;Dear God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE12.T;A Great Disorder;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE12.D;The tensions in the Empire have eventually ended with rioters throughout the country rising against the establishment. Citizens of the capital joined with whatever weapons they could find and began to requisition all guns and arms from depots they stormed. Emperor Sigismund had already fled when the rioters crossed the gates of the palace while trampling the bodies of the Weisse Garde. Many of the Reichstag members had done the same when a woman delegation broke into the Reichstag building to demand a direct vote on the Relief Bill. The situation has yet to calm in the Capital as everyone wonders what will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE12.A;”Is it a revolt?” “No, Your Imperial Majesty, it is a revolution…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE13.T;The Proclamation of the Second Imperial Republic of the German Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE13.D;”In the first year of Liberty, the Reichstag of the German Nation unanimously decrees that the monarchy is abolished and the Reichsrepublik proclaimed…”\n\nAs the storming of $CAPITAL$ left a vacuum of power, the Liberal leaders of the Reichstag along with militants of the Friends of Liberty and Equality have begun to organize a new government. The Zentrales Revolutionskomitee alongside the new Reichstag was filled with Radical leaders that had arrived in the capital before the riots. The Imperial Republic of the German Nation has been reborn! Throughout the country, new mayors are elected while old authorities are forced to flee or accept the new order. As the Fallschwertmaschienen return to Germany, the delegates are drafting a new Constitution and issuing decrees - but already the monarchist threat rises in Bohemia, where Sigismund has rallied the Crownlands, where liberal societies were less popular and the Hollowing less brutal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE14.T;The Provisional Imperial Government-in-Exile in Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE14.D;The capital has been consumed in a maelstrom of revolutionary madness. Thankfully Emperor Sigismund V and the royal family have been able to escape before city was overrun. He has now returned to Prague where he has assembled his loyalists against the Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE14.A;God save the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE15.T;Das Entlastungsdekret;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE15.D;As the Revolution was initiated due to starvation across Germany, it is imperative that we address the immediate needs of the people before proceeding with any other business. To that end the Zentrales Revolutionskomitee has proclaimed the Entlastungsdekret (Relief Decree). Any remaining forms of manorialism and serfdom have been abolished, special tax privileges have been dissolved and made illegal, private hunting spaces have been declared public, and most importantly, all export of foodstuffs beyond the borders of the Imperial Republic have been banned. Police can now search merchant’s storages on suspicion of hoarding and any hoarders of any type of foodstuff, or those proven to be conducting or to have conducted the exportation of food, shall be liable to summary execution by Fallschwertmaschine. The Decree has also organized local committees to distribute food, chiefly bread, beneath the auspices of the new Zentrale Hilfskommission (Central Relief Commission).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE16.T;The Second Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE16.D;“The German people...have resolved to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, inalienable, and sacred rights of man, that all citizens may always take the direction of the welfare of all and never be debased by oppression and tyranny. In consequence, the Reichstag recognizes and declares the following rights of man and citizen. 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions derive only from public utility. 2. The aim of every political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, equality, security, resistance to oppression and the pursuit of Happiness. 3. The source of all sovereignty is essentially in the nation : no body, no individual can exercise authority that does not proceed from it. 4. Liberty consists in the power to do anything that does not injure others : accordingly, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those that secure to the other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE16.A;Insurrection to defend these rights is the most sacred right and duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE17.T;Secularization of the Imperial Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE17.D;The next measure of the Reichstag was the forced secularization of the Church holdings throughout the Empire, meant to provide more financial means to the state while also weakening the hold of the Catholic Church in the Republic. Tithes were made illegal, allowances to church officials were ended, strict revenue caps were imposed upon the clergy, and all lands held by the Catholic Church or any of its ecclesiastical officials were seized by the state. The fate of these lands would be determined at a later date but for the moment all citizens were permitted to farm and hunt upon them as needed. As a direct consequence of this measure, all Prince-Bishops were removed from power, much to the joy of the citizens of Wurzburg, Osnabrück, Basel, and Salzburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE17.A;They can not serve two masters, so let them serve Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE18.T;Abolition of the Princedoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE18.D;”To establish the Constitution, is for us, rebuild and regenerate the State. We cannot be beholden to the old state of things, when it is possible to build better bases. There would not be any regeneration if nothing changed, it is thus our duty to not simply rebuild with some adjustments but to regenerate the whole of the Nation by breaking the feudal provinces and princedoms and establish new administrative units which will help liberty flourish instead of the old prejudices…”\nFollowing the works of the Committee headed by Franz Engels, deputy from Berg, the National Reichstag has decreed that all former divisions of the Empire are null and void, and that all princes of the Empire lose their sovereignty to their former subjects. A new administrative map composed of roughly equal Kreise is drafted by the Assembly, while citizen guards have begun to expel princes from their property if they refused the decree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE18.A;Down with the feudal nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE19.T;The Workers’ Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE19.D;“Territorial and military feudalism has disappeared and financial feudalism must disappear as well. The power of money, the money aristocracy, is at stake.” - Ludwig Weiss, representative of the Köln workers\nThis Revolution is not the same as the one that shook Europe in 1790. The plight of the poor has become even more vivid, and as socialist criticism of republicans circulates amongst workers and intellectuals, some argue that a Social Revolution must accompany the political one. Already the Stadtausschüsse (city committees) have split between socialist and bourgeois representatives. The first demand is an end to urban misery through higher taxes for the urban rich alongside new national state-subsidised workshops to give the poor work and avoid idleness. However, the representatives of the industrial magnates propose that the government leaves the market alone, ensuring a greater prosperity in the years to come, or so they say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE19.A;The Republic will be “social” or it simply will not be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In accordance with these views, We, the undersigned, declare : 1. That all measures promulgated through the Imperial Assembly since the initial disturbance were in contravention of Imperial law, and thus are null and void. 2. That all members of the National Guard who shall fight against the Imperial Army and its allies…shall be treated as enemies and punished as rebels to their Emperor and as disturbers of the public peace. 3.

HRE21.T;The Hamburg Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE21.D;Emperor Sigismund V has been deposed by a revolution  - no, by THE Revolution, a Revolution of pan-German nationalist republicans bearing the torch of Marinus Dahlke. The Jagiellons have retreated to the Bohemian Crown Lands to prepare for a battle for the fate of Germany, but the Emperor does not wish to fight alone. Therefore his agents have arrived in Hamburg for a secret conference with representatives from Burgundy and Scandinavia. The Imperial representatives have declared that Sigismund is willing to make territorial concessions in northern and western Germany to both of our nations in exchange for their support in crushing the Revolution. Given that these Revolutionaries pose a clear and present danger to our realms as well, this seems like an advantageous arrangement…though of course it will also inaugurate yet another cataclysmic war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE21.A;An interesting proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE22.T;Das Vaterland ist in Gefahr!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE22.D;”Citizens, the Motherland is in Danger, besieged by the specter of tyranny and foreign oppression. The tocsin you hear today is not an alarm but an alert : it sounds the charge against our enemies.”\n\nThe Ultimatum of the former Emperor Sigismund has alarmed the Republicans throughout Germany, and already flocks of patriots have signed up to enlist in the Army and fight back the forces of Reaction. However, rumors of Burgundian and Scandinavian intervention have also transpired to our liberal friends in the rest of Europe, and it seems that another Great German War is upon us. The Fallschwertmaschienen await our enemies…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE22.A;Remain audacious and be audacious, and the Republic will be saved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE23.T;The Republican Weights and Measures;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE23.D;Overshadowed by the Prague Declaration and the national mobilization process, the National Assembly has continued its work and has effectively worked on implementing a new system of weights and measures. Thankfully, Etruria hosted numerous Republican thinkers and scientists following the Death of the Republic and they worked with their Italian brothers on a new universal system, the metric system. While the transition will take years, educational pamphlets and conversion tables are already printed to be distributed throughout the country. A new calendar is also surprisingly being worked upon, with many deputies agreeing to the idea of a complete break with the Ancien Regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE23.A;Work must continue even in war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE24.T;The Imperial Reclamation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE24.D;With the restoration of the Imperial Republic and the regrouping of loyalist and Czech elements of the Reichsarmee in Bohemia, Sigismund has begun conspiring with the monarchies of Scandinavia and Burgundy to assist him in re-asserting his tyrannical rule over Germany at the expense of outrageous “territorial appeasements”! Empowered by these, the deposed upstarts have announced their intention to wage war to restore “order” to our lands! The time has come! The servants of the Fatherland stand ready to face the threat once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE24.A;Ihr kräftigen Diener des Vaterlandes, haltet fest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE25.D;Observers have witnessed the reformation of the so-called “Imperial Republic of the German Nation” in Germany, with many perceived Imperial loyalists, nobility, and even rumors of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being put to death by the Fallschwertmaschine! The Republican Blutfahne is raised once more in towns and cities throughout Germany after the deposition of the Emperor in Prague. The Imperial German envoy in $CAPITAL$ has reportedly begged on his knees in front of our $MONARCH_TITLE$ requesting outright military intervention in Germany to depose the “barbaric” republicans. With both the public outraged by the quick succession of events and the government wary of the potential instability, we have no choice but to fulfill our duty to quell the German menace. We cannot allow another Dahlke to scythe through the fields of Europe and spread the revolutionary plague to our people for the second time this century!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE26.D;”Lay the proud usurpers low! Tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty's in every blow! Let us do or die.” - from ‘Germania’s Call’ by Gilbert Broun, Scottish poet and personal friend of Marinus Dahlke\n\nThe impossible has proven itself possible : Emperor Sigismund V has repeated the sins of his fathers, and the Imperial Republic of the German Nation has been resurrected by the Reichstag. The “Alten Regime” denounced this declaration, with Burgundy and Scandinavian preparing to assist Pro-Jagiellion Royalist forces in Bohemia to “restore order” in Germany. Together they have formed a new anti-radical coalition, reminiscent of olden times, with the sole goal of crushing the rebel upstarts. Observers are universal in their assessment that is is the start of a conflict unparalleled in the history of warfare. The Revolutionary Hydra has resurfaced. However, can it best its predecessor and fulfill Dahlke’s dreams of a liberal and free Europe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE26.A;So sei es!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE27.T;The Montmorency Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE27.D;The Dual Monarchy has observed with interest and anguish the recent Imperial developments. If many rejoiced at the troubles in Germany and a weakening of the Empire at first, the Republican Revolution and its massacres of priests and nobles has made the government wary of Republican successes. Following the latest reports about the defeats of the Imperial armies against the Republicans in Bohemia, the War Minister, François-Charles de Montmorency has issued with the tacit agreement of the King a manifesto demanding that the Emperor be left untouched. The document promises a violence never seen before against the Republicans otherwise, if any harm were to occur to His Imperial Majesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE27.A;We only seek to preserve Sigismund’s safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE28.T;The Montmorency Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE28.D;”His Majesty the King of England and France and his government declare that they regard the actual situation of His Imperial Majesty the Holy Roman Emperor as a matter of communal interest for all sovereigns of Europe. The subjects of His Imperial Majesty shall be required to place that prince in full and complete liberty, and to assure to him the inviolability required by his Majesty. If the least violence be offered to their Majesties, and if their safety and their liberty are not immediately assured, the government of his Majesty will inflict an ever memorable vengeance by delivering over the Imperial subjects to military execution and complete destruction, and the rebels guilty of the said outrages to the punishment that they merit…”\nOur successes in Bohemia have angered the Dual Monarchy which now dares to threaten us if we deliver Sigismund to the justice he is due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE28.A;The rumors were true! §RALL OF EUROPE IS AGAINST US!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE29.T;The Capture of Citizen Sigismund Jagiellon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE29.D;After a series of successes in Bohemia, the Republican armies have entered Prague where the traitor and tyrant Sigismund was hiding. After the assault on the old Castle of Prague, Sigismund accepted peace and was turned over to the Republican authorities. The news of his capture alongside his call to stop the fighting has made the Royalist armies shatter, with many Royal Czech and German forces abandoning the fighting to come back to their villages. A few have even defected to our cause!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE29.A;A great victory over tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE30.T;The Execution of the Last Holy Roman Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE30.D;”One cannot reign innocently : the insanity of doing so is evident. Every monarch is a rebel and a usurper.” - Anton Tassing, Consul of the National Assembly\n\nThe escort of Citizen Jagiellon to Frankfurt was swift and his trial even more so. Accused of a lengthy list of crimes, among them conspiracy with foreign enemies, orders to bring war to its own people and refusal to accept the new national assembly, the former Emperor hardly tried to defend himself, preferring to stay mute for much of the process. The Assembly, alarmed by the War and knowing that Sigismund would be a liability for the Republic, overwhelmingly voted for his execution. He was thus today brought to the newly renamed Freiheit Plaza, where masses gathered to assist in his execution by Fallschwertmaschine. His last words to the crowd were lost because of the sound of drums, but he died a dignified death according to most witnesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE30.A;Be brave, Sigismund, the whole universe looks upon you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE31.T;The Execution of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE31.D;The execution of Emperor Sigismund V by the horrible Fallschwertmaschine has horrified and outraged the Anglois court. No monarch has ever died by the hands of the common people in the history of Europe, certainly not a sovereign seen by much of Christendom as the closest spiritual heir of both Charlemagne and Caesar Augustus. Now it seems that everything is possible, and the worst nightmares of the ruling class of the continent are invading the waking world. As the Montmorency Manifesto had declared, the Anglois troops have mobilized to end this abomination in Central Europe and bring back order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE31.A;For the memory of the Emperor! DEUS VULT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE32.T;The Reactionaries of $FROM$ Declare War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE32.D;The Anglois government, outraged by our recent actions, has joined the new Coalition in their efforts to destroy our revolutionary government. As a realm built upon the hereditary power of the Anglois ruling class and the support of the Catholic Church, few members of the Zentrales Revolutionskomitee are surprised by this development. If we can topple the Anglois behemoth then one of the greatest bastions of reaction in Europe shall fall. We must strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE33.T;Victory over Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE33.D;The Burgundian monarchy, this vulture which has preyed upon Germany for all their history, is now vanquished, and the Parliamentarians' opponents to King Jean have already welcomed us with open arms. Now the Reichstag and the Komitee must decide Burgundy’s fate. After all, Burgundy was part of the Holy Roman Empire since their elevation to a Kingdom, and many Germanic people reside within their borders. The most simple solution would be the seizure of the Rhineland and Elsass while guaranteeing a unified Burgundy their independence. Another possibility would be to also seize the Dutch territories of Frisia and Holland, for they share language and culture with us. Or we could also dismantle Burgundy completely, with new puppet republics in Brabant, Wallonia and Lorraine or even integrate the Brabant territories within the Republic. However, the dismantlement of Burgundy will likely tarnish our standing on the world stage and embolden the monarchist regimes in pursuing imperialist affairs overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE33.A;The Rhineland & Elsass will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE33.B;The Dutch, the Rhenish, all estranged Germans must be saved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the Royal threat in England, most experts agree that a strong French state will manage to quell any revolt and be a reliable ally against the Plantagenets. Yet the Occitans and Bretons also long for liberty, and may agitate and prove seditious if we do not ensure they become independent Republics.

The Komitee receive regular reports of agitators tearing down Republican symbols in streets and engaging in fights with Republican sympathizers. Worse, even in rural areas where the Bohemian nobility was never very popular, our enforcement of secularism has brought back bitter memories of persecution amongst the Utraquists, quasi-Catholic disciples of Jan Hus who were brutally attacked by the Church in ages past. Now both Catholics and Utraquists, Germans and Slavs have started devoting signs to the Jagiellons and their hope, Wenceslaus VI Jagiellon, the son of Sigismund we hold in custody until the war concludes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While far more organized and less discriminating than the principle of “terror as exceptional justice” that accompanied Dahlke’s rise to power, priests preaching against the Republic, nobles trying to emigrate or fight the new authorities, and traders accused of being hoarders compose most of the executed.

HRE53.D;With the Empire now solidified thanks to Emperor Sigismund V, the time has come to select a new Imperial capital. His Imperial Majesty would prefer to remain in Prague. It has served the Jagiellons well, but keeping the court here would only strengthen the arguments by German nationalists and Republicans that the Empire is still a Bohemian project first and foremost. Two alternate candidates have been identified : Nuremberg has hosted the Imperial Regalia since the Hussite wars, and the tragic fire of 1839 makes the city perfect for a new urban plan fitting for the Imperial capital. On the other hand, Regensburg was the city where the Reichstag was hosted permanently since the 17th century, and choosing the city would prove the continuity of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE53.C;Regensburg, the confirmed seat of the Reichstag.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.T;Integration of the Saxon Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.D;The Imperial Circles are an ancient method of dividing the Empire for administrative purposes. Ever since the Scandinavian invasion in the early 17th century, the northern halves of the Lower Saxon and the Upper Saxon Circles have been held by the Nordics. It was only recently that they were reunified, and time has not been kind to this division. Moreover northeastern Germany in general saw some of the worst fighting during the Great German Wars and was brutally affected by the Hollowing. Add to this the primitive state of its industries and the strength of local Protestantism and the result is that it will likely take time to properly consolidate the area. That is, of course, unless we wish to tackle the old institutions head-on by promulgating a unified Imperial legal code to flatten its old feudalistic laws and practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.A;We still have to work for unity…;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.B;§RImperial Unity at all costs!§;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.T;Integration of the Rhenish Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.D;The weakness of prior Emperors allowed the Burgundians to accumulate more and more of the Electoral Rhenish and Lower Rhenish-Westphalian circles. Burgundy relentlessly fostered Protestantism and reckless industrial development within this area, to the detriment of its citizens. The region was also severely affected by the Hollowing, particularly the sections most distant from Burgundian control. Even before Burgundy’s entrance, the area was long divided by a patchwork of prince-bishoprics. It will likely take time to properly consolidate the area. That is, of course, unless we wish to tackle the old institutions head-on by promulgating a unified Imperial legal code to flatten its old feudalistic laws and practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.A;We still have to work for unity…;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.B;§RImperial Unity at all costs!§;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.T;Integration of the Danubian and Franconian Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.D;While the Franconian Circle has a long history, the Danubian Circle was created by the combination of the Austrian and the Bavarian Circles in ages past. This region became a hub of anti-Imperial sentiment in recent years, and its nobility still has yet to fully reconcile with Prague. Moreover the influence of the Catholic Church is felt with particular strength here, and while this protected the area from Protestantism during the Reformation, it has now become an obstacle. While the region managed to escape the worst of the Hollowing its infrastructure and economic development still pale in comparison to the Bohemian crown lands. It will likely take time to properly consolidate the area. That is, of course, unless we wish to tackle the old institutions head-on by promulgating a unified Imperial legal code to flatten its old feudalistic laws and practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.A;We still have to work for unity…;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.B;§RImperial Unity at all costs!§;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE57.T;Integration of the Upper Rhenish and Swabian Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE57.D;The Upper Rhenish and Swabian Circle have long been a battleground of influence between the Emperor and the Burgundians. The region has been particularly divided for most of its history, with the Alpine confederations of the south seeing themselves as quite distinct from their cultural kin to the north. There was particular tension between Bavaria and Wurttemberg over the city of Ulm, which brought the two powers into open conflict more than once during the First Great German War. Even though the region escaped the worst of the Hollowing, its development is still a far cry from that of the Bohemian crown lands, and its nobility have little love for the Emperor. Add to that the influence of more than one Protestant sect within the Circle and the result is that it will likely take time to properly consolidate the area. That is, of course, unless we wish to tackle the old institutions head-on by promulgating a unified Imperial legal code to flatten its old feudalistic laws and practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE58.T;Judenemazipationsreichgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE58.D;Germany’s status as a religious battlefield made surmounting sectarianism an important goal of the First German Revolution. While the negotiated end of first the Hussite and later the Religious Wars enshrined the doctrine of “Cuius Regio, Eius Religio,” the Jews were never seen as true equals to Christians. German revolutionaries have always sought to bring all German people under one banner and from the beginning that has included the Jews. After all, they say, what is Yiddish but a German language? The First Revolution placed Jews on an equal legal footing within the Empire, and while those laws were undone in 1820, now the Committee has restored them in the “Imperial Law for Jewish Emancipation.” Furthermore the rebirth of rationalism and humanism across Germany has only emboldened the Reform Judaism movement, which is now surging amongst the Ashkenazim. Several high civil and military posts are being filled by Jews, and young Jewish men, filled with German nationalist fervor, are signing up by the hundreds into the Reichsarmee.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE580.T;Legacy of Gilbert Braun;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE580.D;Gilbert Braun (born Gilbert Broun) was a Scottish poet who wrote in the Scots vernacular at a time when it was disdained as the language of the peasantry. Historians have since deemed him the "Father of Romanticism," with both his work and his support for traditional language and culture inspiring generations of artists.  While beloved most of all in Scotland, he is also famous in Germany (where he fled during the last years of Ludwig VII’s rule to escape political persecution) for his support of the German Revolution. "Braun'' rewrote "Scots Wha Hae," his patriotic Scottish song setting the traditional tune "Hey Tuttie Tatie" to the lyrics of a speech given by Robert the Bruce before the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, into “Germania’s Call,” a German nationalist anthem sung by Germania, the female personification of Germany popular with liberals. It was immortalized when German troops sang it before the Battle of Kassel against monarchist forces in 1791, with said battle being the first victory by the Imperial Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE59.T;The Imperial Republic of Germany Proposes an Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE59.D;The Imperial Republic of Germany recently expanded its diplomatic offices within our capital. This morning we learned that this was not an isolated decision - the Germans wish to secure a military alliance with us! The German ambassador arrived this morning to formally make the proposition. As Europe is still dominated by reaction, he argues, its few republics must stick together. Furthermore Italian and German Radicalists have a long history of cooperation and shared values. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE59.A;Of course! Let the crowned heads of the world tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE59.B;This is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE60.T;The Alpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE60.D;$FROM$ and the Imperial Republic of Germany are two of the most notorious republican powers in Europe, and now they have joined forces. A treaty of military alliance has been published in which both powers have pledged to defend one another in the case of outside attack and to “coordinate on central European affairs.” The ties between German and Italian Radicalists go back to at least the 1790s if not earlier and now they have been cemented as political fact. For the first time since the retreat of the Holy Roman Empire from Italy both halves of the Alps have now been reunited, not through a crown but by shared values of liberty, equality, and fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE60.A;A pact as strong as steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE61.T;Failure of the Alpine Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE61.D;$FROM$ and the Imperial Republic of Germany are two of the most notorious republican powers in Europe. It has long been speculated that they might seek an alliance with one another against the forces of reaction. However a meeting between their representatives in Florence failed to agree on the terms of the treaty. While both nations have still reaffirmed their commitment to supporting republicanism in Europe, it is doubtful that they shall coordinate their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE61.A;We will carry on regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE66.T;Formation of the Deutsche Fortschrittspartei;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE66.D;Dahlkism is once more rearing its ugly head within $FROM$ as a group of exiled German liberals in Venexia have formed the German Progress Party (DFP) led by famous author Reinhard Kapp. This group seeks to overthrow the monarchy, disempower the Catholic Church within Germany, and establish a democratic republic. While we are trying to restrict their presence within the Empire and suppress their literature, smuggling and clandestine publishing networks have made this difficult. The voice of republicanism is growing in Germany and with it the pressure for reforms, if only to satisfy liberal demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE66.A;Gott schütze den Kaiser!;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE67.T;Formation of the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE67.D;Multiple underground far-left groups have existed within $FROM$ for decades, but one appears to be rising above the rest. The new Socialist Workers’ Party of Germany (DSAP) is far more radical than most socialist parties, calling for a proletarian society governed by the workers’ councils (räte) that have emerged across Germany during its industrialization, especially after the Hollowing. While outside observers have described them as communists, the DSAP rejects this label, preferring instead to describe their policies as “rätesozialismus” or “council socialism.” The suppression of more moderate organizations has stirred many German leftists to see revolutionary means as their only hope of societal change.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE67.A;Gott schütze den Kaiser!;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE68.T;Formation of the Deutsche Sozialistische Republikanische Partei;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE68.D;The failures of the DSAP and other more extremist left-wing groups have led to fracturing, with one group in particular now ascendant. The German Socialist Republican Party (DSRP) is an alliance between the center-left and dissident members of the far left seeking to organize around social democracy. While moderating Blanquist rhetoric they are vehement in their commitment to secularism, anti-imperialism, economic nationalization, and the abolition of the monarchy. As the government has previously focused on eradicating the far left since the rise of the DSAP, this has allowed the DSRP to fill the power vacuum left by its suppression. Many middle-class Germans who previously saw leftism as a lower-class concept are attracted to the DSRP’s promises of a better life without total societal upheaval, and with few democratic channels to divert this impulse into, the DSRP is becoming the face of anti-government resistance in the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE68.A;Gott schütze den Kaiser!;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE69.T;Räte Organize Within the Kaiserlichearmee;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE69.D;The DSRP’s popularity has only continued to advance, and now they have entered a dangerous stage : organization within the military. Many soldiers and sailors have long been dissatisfied by conditions within the Kaiserlichearmee, be it the low pay, abuses from officers, long periods of service, or meager pensions. Now the DRSP has taken to helping the more ideologically-inclined soldiers to organize räte within their units. These councils coordinate political activity, hold educational workshops and lectures, distribute literature, and in at least one case have attempted to organize strikes or even elect their own officers! §RLosing the loyalty of the military is not an option. We must quickly secure the stability of the nation or else the Revolution shall come and find us defenseless.§;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE70.T;The Final German Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE70.D;”The German Revolution is nothing but the precursor of another revolution, one that will be greater, more solemn, and which will be the last.” - Gracchus Mendel, ‘Manifesto of Equals,’ 1796\n\nThe Jagiellons’ ruthless centralisation and absolutism has at last gone too far. Recently some Bohemian soldiers stationed in the Rhineland were sent to Essen to put down a strike at a cannery, after a Burgundian worker was fired without pay for daring to ask for injured leave after losing his hand in an accident. It was hoped the cultural differences between soldiers and workers would make solidarity impossible. When ordered to use live rounds against protestors, the soldiers instead shot down their officers! Soon workers’ councils across Germany initiated a general strike, and many soldiers flocked to their defense. Now most of the Empire has been seized by the DSRP under Otto Hayek and Prague must once more fight for its dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE70.A;§RGOD DAMN YOU! GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!§;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE700.T;The End of the Thousand Years’ Reich;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE700.D;”The Holy Roman Empire is ruled directly by the Lord God. Otherwise it is impossible to imagine how this state still exists.” - Josef Dubrovin, Russian journalist\nThe weakening of Imperial autocracy has inspired the revolutionary anarchist group known as the People’s Will to strike. As the Emperor and his son the Crown Prince were returning from a visit abroad, an anarchist threw a bomb beneath the imperial carriage, sending it to the ground. The royals emerged unharmed, only for a second assassin to approach them unseen and lob a bomb at the ground while less than a meter away. The resulting explosion killed all three men instantly, and soon after, a Czech nationalist revolt broke out in Moravia and then swept the Bohemian crown lands. All the years of centralization left no ability for the loyalists to regroup, and so the Imperial Circles have been seized by local princes, rogue military officers, and other men of means. This marks the end of over a millennium of Imperial history and Europe shall never be the same again.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE700.A;Goodnight, Germania.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE71.T;Olaf Adenauer and Yellow Syndicalism;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE71.D;The Geheime Staatspolizei has witnessed the rapid rise of Olaf Adenauer, a former revolutionary turned informant who has become a famous police administrator. He has pioneered the nationwide use of undercover informants, asserting that the typical plainclothes detectives are insufficient for the modern age. Far more significant, however, are his labor policies. Adenauer may be a staunch monarchist and Catholic but he also believes that the government must work to control unionism if it does not want to allow socialism to grow. In his self-published essay, “On Labor and the Crown,” he has advocated for legalized, police-controlled trade unions and other labor organizations paid stipends by the government - a policy he dubs “yellow syndicalism” (as opposed to “red,” independent and Blanquist groups), and which revolutionaries deride as “police syndicalism.” The essay has become quite popular amongst the bureaucracy, and the Emperor’s cabinet has urged him to support the policy to defuse trade union agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE71.A;Make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE72.T;Suicide of DSRP Leader Otto Hayek;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE72.D;Otto Hayek was a notorious trade union activist, a German-Hungarian Jew from Pressburg whose parents later relocated to Vienna. It has been alleged that Hayek, leader of the underground German Socialist Republican Party (DSRP), coordinated bank robberies in foreign countries to finance the DSRP. One judge who claimed to have evidence on Hayek was later found decapitated near a railroad track : it was unclear if it was suicide or murder. Last year Hayek was charged with theft but his trial was postponed twelve times. Recently he was found dead from a gunshot wound in a small house in Ems.  His death has been ruled a suicide but many leftists believe that the police killed him. Fourteen Prague newspapers reported his death as a suicide but eight did not. The distance the bullet had traveled caused the newspaper Der Magdeburger Zeitung to sarcastically propose that Hayek had "a long arm.” Whatever the case his death has sown discord amongst the German left.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE73.D;For years we have been attempting to infiltrate the German Socialist Republican Party (DSRP) and the shadowy SR-Spartakusgruppe, its militant terrorist wing which carries out bombings, assassinations, and robberies across the Empire. Minister of Safety Geert van Richtofen had organized a new group of informants which he believed would finally get us access to the DSRP and the SR-S. This morning he was on his way to his office in his horse-drawn carriage when a bomb was thrown into it! Minister van Richtofen died in an instant. We have already apprehended the assassin, a Czech named Antonin Gottwald. It is believed that notorious revolutionary Heim Bronstein was the plot’s orchestrator. While it is true that Bronstein is the Empire’s most infamous terrorist, unfortunately he is also our highest paid informant! Director of Police Hermann von Kluck has already resigned in fury, as it was over his objections that Bronstein had been hired in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Karl Gustav Schwaub, an industrialist and leader of the monarchist League of Virtue, and Walter von Manstein, creator of the All-German Union, have joined forces under the umbrella of the White League. The White League, in broader terms, describes many organizations united around anti-Semitism, monarchism, Catholic ultramontanism, and German supremacism. They defend the Emperor as the holy emissary of God, a man even closer to the Lord than any other sovereign. Backed by conservative intellectuals, landlords, Catholic priests, bureaucrats, and businessmen, the Weissebund defend “God’s Empire, God’s Church, and God’s German people” through threats, assault, murder, and arson.;;;;;;;;;;;;

End_the_Hollowing_HLR_1_desc;The Hollowing has dealt incalculable harm to Germany, and no prior measures of the Imperial government or any of the Imperial Estates have alleviated it. A group of leading German economists have declared that the conduct of the landlords and merchants of the Empire has been singularly destructive, and that what is needed is massive government intervention. Representatives sympathetic to them have submitted a bill restoring Wenceslaus-era grain prices per ounce, setting them at a fixed rate nationwide, and forcing grain merchants to sell a certain percentage of their product domestically before they are allowed to export it. As this is likely to create a black market, the bill would also allow police to search foodstuff merchants’ merchandise without a warrant and create an Imperial Agricultural Committee to purchase grain on behalf of farmers and set fixed prices for exports. Furthermore the bill includes several more typical methods of poor relief such as distributing clothing and goods to them and creating workhouses to allow the poor to earn a living wage.\n§RPassing another important reform of the Empire before this one will embolden the radical and republican elements of the Reichstag!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The devastation of the region will only be remedied through a vast Northern Reconstruction Program. We must support new industries, subsidize small farmers and fishers, and provide new agricultural equipment. Fertilizers especially will be crucial for dealing with the uncharitable soil.

Resolve_Clergy_Problem_HRE_desc;While the Protestant churches of the Empire are thankfully only an issue at the regional level, the Catholic Church has been distressed by our efforts to curtail the power of the German clergy. It is not the existence of the Church within Germany that we oppose, merely its landed estates. Fortunately we have now managed to sway enough members of the College of Cardinals to support us that we can put pressure upon His Holiness the Pope for a settlement. We shall recognize the Catholic Church’s privileges within the Empire in exchange for the Pope accepting the nationalization of church lands throughout the realm, and thus the disestablishment of all prince-bishoprics. Unlike states such as Spain, which are also embarking upon campaigns to reduce Church influence, we are in a stronger position and over time we shall whittle away at the Church’s remaining privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Resolve_Strong_Princes_HRE_desc;A direct assault upon the Imperial Estates, represented by their princes, would provoke a civil war. A far more clever plan has been presented by some of our ministers. We shall establish several imperial societies for the arts, which are to be headed by the various princes. The princes will have full control to pursue whatever artistic endeavor they want, music composition, painting, sculpting, even castle building if they want to. We will also organize Imperial competitions in which the princes shall be tacitly encouraged to spend lavishly to support their chosen artists as a demonstration of their prestige. As many princes are in debt we shall buy out their estates and encourage them to use their newfound money towards these cultural ends. Finally, we shall quietly terminate the practice of selling officer commissions, requiring all officers henceforth to graduate from one of the official Imperial military academies. This should keep them busy enough that they should no longer pose a threat to us or hamper our control, and hasten the reduction of their personal fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;#pay off the nobles

Resolve_Old_Liberties_HRE_desc; The democratic traditions of the free cities and the Swiss cantons has often caused conflict with the monarchical nature of the Empire. However that does not mean that they are incompatible. We shall introduce a new office for these areas known as the Reichsgouverneurs, which, like their current office, will be an elected office, but shall be equal to any of the princes of the Empire. With this reform we will earn the loyalty of these areas and finally completely integrate them into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Resolve_Woes_of_Industry_HRE_desc;The rapid urbanization of certain regions of the Empire, particularly the Ruhr but also the Rhine in general, has caused these communities to swell to grotesque proportions. Sanitation is in a disgraceful state and the cities themselves seem at risk of being swallowed up by their own factories. We will summon the most eminent engineers and artists in the realm to reorganize these growing cities through a vast new regime of urban planning. Boulevards will be created as opposed to narrow medieval streets, new housing developments shall be constructed, mandatory minimum standards of water purity enacted, and plumbing, heating, and railways will be extended through as many cities as possible. Furthermore these communities will be given financial incentives to support museums, theaters, art galleries, public parks, and other centers of culture and leisure. This should make these cities both safer and more pleasant to live in, to say nothing of added economic efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reform_Reichsarmee_HRE_desc;The Reichsarmee has always been defined by its lack of coherence. Drawing upon the various Imperial Estates prohibited any type of standardization, and could cause errors of communication owing to officers and soldiers being unable to understand one another’s accents and dialects. The type of equipment furnished to them varied widely according to the resources of their Imperial Estate of origin. No more. We shall adopt a single standardized uniform, rifle, sidearm, and field kit for all Imperial soldiers and officers. The Imperial Military Academies will all be merged into a single system, and an Imperial Strategic and Tactical Development Committee will be established to regularly update their curriculum with information from recent wars and research.  Fluency in Bohemian German will be required to graduate, and basic competence in Bohemian German will become mandatory for all soldiers. With these measures we shall finally bring order to the military and with it unity of action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reform_Culture_HRE_desc;Ours is not merely an empire of Germans. Czechs, Lusatians, Silesians, Slovenes, French, Burgundians, Italians…What unites us? It is quite simple : we are all part of the Imperial Germanic cultural world! The German culture forms the center around which all others orbit, yet their orbits affect one another in turn, and are all components of a singular system. New research in the emerging fields of sociology and cultural history show that people across the Empire regardless of language share many similar myths and traditions. And of course the Bohemians, so long seen as suspect by the other German peoples, are themselves undeniably German! We are the center of Europe, its pinnacle, its distillation, the greatest our continent has to offer. We shall create cultural endowments for artists and authors who we deem to be advancing the Imperial Germanic culture, and establish state facilities for adults who wish to learn German. Let us all unite in brotherhood beneath the Imperial flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Needless to say, the amount of time needed to convert one currency to another severely stunts the potential growth of our country.

This constitution will reorganize the Imperial Republic into a federal state with universal male suffrage, a Reichstag elected by party-list proportional representation under private ballots, freedom of speech and assembly,  and a Tribune to serve as head of government while the Consul shall remain head of state. Long live the Imperial Republic of the German Nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

End_the_Hollowing_HLR_2_title;Pass the Aushöhlungspräventionsgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
End_the_Hollowing_HLR_2_desc;The Hollowing has dealt incalculable harm to Germany, and no prior measures of the Imperial government or any of the Imperial Estates have alleviated it. The Imperial court has concluded that the conduct of the landlords and merchants of the Empire have been singularly destructive, and that what is needed is massive government intervention. A bill has been drafted by Sigismund and his advisors that would restore Wenceslaus-era grain prices per ounce, setting them at a fixed rate nationwide, and forcing grain merchants to sell a certain percentage of their product domestically before they are allowed to export it. As this is likely to create a black market, the bill would also allow police to search foodstuff merchants’ merchandise without a warrant and create an Imperial Agricultural Committee to purchase grain on behalf of farmers and set fixed prices for exports. Furthermore the bill includes several more typical methods of poor relief such as distributing clothing and goods to them and creating workhouses to allow the poor to earn a living wage.\n§RPassing another important reform of the Empire before this one will embolden the radical and republican elements of the Reichstag!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_North_title;Incorporate the Saxon Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_North_desc;The Upper and Lower Saxon Circles are the main administrative regions for the Elbe River. They are the main mercantile center of Germany, holding several outlets to the Baltic and multiple important commercial cities with old ties to the Hansa before its evacuation to the New World. However they have seen better days, as nearly two centuries of war between ourselves and Scandinavia, paired with the Hollowing, have decimated the region. Furthermore their lack of valuable minerals and poor soil have caused them to lag behind in industrial and agricultural development compared to the rest of Germany. It will take substantial effort to address the status of the North but it must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_Rhine_title;Incorporate the Lower Rhenish Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_Rhine_desc;The Electoral Rhenish and the Lower Rhenish-Wesphalian Circles are the main administrative regions of the northern Rhine River. They are the main industrial heart of Germany, even more so than Silesia, and their cities are of dizzying size. However they have suffered over the years, as ages of conflict between ourselves and the Burgundians have made them into both a literal and a religious battleground, to say nothing of the Hollowing. Furthermore the haphazard flocking of rural Germans to the Rhenish cities has turned them into edifices of urban blight. It will take substantial effort to address the status of the West but it must be done! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_South_title;Incorporate the Danubian and Franconian Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_South_desc;The Danubian and Franconian Circles are the main administrative regions of the Danube and the Main Rivers. They are the main political heart of Germany, rivaling even Bohemia, and they have also become renowned for their arts and architecture. However the Great German Wars wrought chaos across the region, and while they weathered the Hollowing well that is only in comparison to other areas. Furthermore much of their development is highly uneven and their rural areas continue to lag behind even as the cities prosper. It will take substantial effort to address the status of the Southeast but it must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_Swabia_title;Incorporate the Upper Rhenish and Swabian Circles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_Swabia_desc;The Upper Rhenish and Swabian Circles are the main administrative regions of the southern Rhine and the Neckar Rivers. The region has struggled to find a single identity or aspect to rally around, having been exceptionally divided even by the standards of the modern Empire. Similar to the northern Rhine this region has long been in contention between ourselves and Burgundy, giving rise to religious tensions between Catholics and Protestants. Furthermore their distant location from most centers of Imperial trade has caused them to become dangerously isolated from the rest of Germany. It will take substantial effort to address the status of the Southwest but it must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Develop_The_North_HRE_Abso_title;Begin the Nördliche Entwicklung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Develop_The_North_HRE_Abso_desc;Northern Germany has never been rich in resources. Many Elbian Germans had begun to emigrate to the New World decades before the Hollowing and the Second Great German War, driven by various economic and political concerns. The devastation of the region will only be remedied through a vast Northern Reconstruction Program. We must support new industries, subsidize small farmers and fishers, and provide new agricultural equipment. Fertilizers especially will be crucial for dealing with the uncharitable soil. With tremendous effort, we shall turn the blighted lands of the Elbe into a place so prosperous that people from across the Empire shall flock to live there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Clergy_Problem_HRE_Abso_title;Reichskonkordat of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Clergy_Problem_HRE_Abso_desc;While the Protestant churches of the Empire are thankfully only an issue at the regional level, the Catholic Church has been distressed by our efforts to curtail the power of the German clergy. It is not the existence of the Church within Germany that we oppose, merely its landed estates. Fortunately we have now managed to sway enough members of the College of Cardinals to support us that we can put pressure upon His Holiness the Pope for a settlement. We shall recognize the Catholic Church’s privileges within the Empire in exchange for the Pope accepting the nationalization of church lands throughout the realm, and thus the disestablishment of all prince-bishoprics. Unlike states such, as Spain which are also embarking upon campaigns to reduce Church influence, we are in a stronger position and over time we shall whittle away at the Church’s remaining privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Strong_Princes_HRE_Abso_title;Curtail Princely Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Strong_Princes_HRE_Abso_desc;A direct assault upon the Imperial Estates, represented by their princes, would provoke a civil war. A far more clever plan has been presented by some of our ministers. We shall establish several imperial societies for the arts, which are to be headed by the various princes. The princes will have full control to pursue whatever artistic endeavor they want, music composition, painting, sculpting, even castle building if they want to. We will also organize Imperial competitions in which the princes shall be tacitly encouraged to spend lavishly to support their chosen artists as a demonstration of their prestige. As many princes are in debt we shall buy out their estates and encourage them to use their newfound money towards these cultural ends. Finally, we shall quietly terminate the practice of selling officer commissions, requiring all officers henceforth to graduate from one of the official Imperial military academies. This should keep them busy enough that they should no longer pose a threat to us or hamper our control, and hasten the reduction of their personal fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;#pay off the nobles
Resolve_Old_Liberties_HRE_Abso_title;Establish New Garrisons and the Reichspolizei;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Old_Liberties_HRE_Abso_desc;The unrest of past years has often originated from our cities. The Imperial Free Cities have always been problematic, yet another symptom of the weakness of past emperors and the inability to keep the realm united. Many times suspects in an Imperial Estate have fled to a Free City to evade arrest. Rather than immediately dissolve their statuses we shall instead establish new barracks and garrisons in the urban centers of the Empire to keep these places contained. Soldiers will be regularly relocated between cities to prevent them from growing too close to the locals. In addition an Imperial Police Service shall be created which shall hold jurisdiction over the entire empire, answerable to the Imperial Aulic Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Resolve_Woes_of_Industry_HRE_Abso_title;Initiate Städtische Neuordnung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Resolve_Woes_of_Industry_HRE_Abso_desc;The rapid urbanization of certain regions of the Empire, particularly the Ruhr but also the Rhine in general, has caused these communities to swell to grotesque proportions. Sanitation is in a disgraceful state and the cities themselves seem at risk of being swallowed up by their own factories. We will summon the most eminent engineers and artists in the realm to reorganize these growing cities through a vast new regime of urban planning. Boulevards will be created as opposed to narrow medieval streets, new housing developments shall be constructed, mandatory minimum standards of water purity enacted, and plumbing, heating, and railways will be extended through as many cities as possible. Furthermore these communities will be given financial incentives to support museums, theaters, art galleries, public parks, and other centers of culture and leisure. This should make these cities both safer and more pleasant to live in, to say nothing of added economic efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With this reunion, German nationalism is finally reconciling with the Imperial system, as we become the undisputed champion of the Germanic peoples. Perhaps we should now turn our eyes to the powers who have for too long tyrannized the German people : Burgundy and Scandinavia.

Reform_Reichsarmee_HRE_Abso_title;Reform the Kaiserliche Armee;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Reichsarmee_HRE_Abso_desc;The Kaiserliche Armee has been defined by its lack of coherence. Drawing as it does upon the various Imperial Estates prohibits any type of standardization, and leads to errors of communication owing to officers and soldiers being unable to understand one another’s accents and dialects. The type of equipment furnished to them varied widely according to the resources of their Imperial Estate of origin. No more. We shall adopt a single standardized uniform, rifle, sidearm, and field kit for all Imperial soldiers and officers. The Imperial Military Academies will all be merged into a single system, and an Imperial Strategic and Tactical Development Committee will be established to regularly update their curriculum with information from recent wars and research. Fluency in Bohemian German will be required to graduate, and basic competence in Bohemian German will become mandatory for all soldiers. With these measures we shall finally bring order to the military and with it unity of action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Culture_HRE_Abso_title;Promote an Imperial Germanic Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Culture_HRE_Abso_desc;Ours is not merely an empire of Germans. Czechs, Lusatians, Silesians, Slovenes, French, Burgundians, Italians…What unites us? It is quite simple : we are all part of the Imperial Germanic cultural world! German culture forms the center around which all others orbit, yet their orbits affect one another in turn, and are all components of a singular system. New research in the emerging fields of sociology and cultural history show that people across the Empire regardless of language share many similar myths and traditions. And of course the Bohemians, so long seen as suspect by the other German peoples, are themselves undeniably German! We are the center of Europe, its pinnacle, its distillation, the greatest our continent has to offer. We shall create cultural endowments for artists and authors who we deem to be advancing the Imperial Germanic culture, and establish state facilities for adults who wish to learn German. Let us all unite in brotherhood beneath the Imperial flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Economy_HRE_1_Abso_title;Create the Zentralreichsbank and the Reichsmark;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Economy_HRE_1_Abso_desc;Many economists believe that the financial whirlwinds of the past have been the result of a vacuum of authority to cushion the market and intervene in times of crisis. While there are dozens of small banks throughout the empire they have no incentive to coordinate their actions and their records of business are all but unknown to us. An Imperial Central Bank shall be formed under which all existing central banks of the Imperial Estates will be subordinated. A single currency, the Reichsmark, shall be introduced, with its value pegged to the gold standard. All banks and other businesses will be required to use Reichsmarks and no other form of currency shall be produced within the Empire, though other notes currently in circulation shall still be recognized as their usage is phased out. Just as the Emperor is the arbiter of the Empire, the Zentralreichsbank shall be the arbiter of our economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Economy_HRE_2_Abso_title;Enact the Branchenexpansionsprogramm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Reform_Economy_HRE_2_Abso_desc;One of the most aggravating legacies of the Empire’s division is the inadequacy of German infrastructure. The humble horse and carriage is still the transportation method of choice throughout much of the Empire, few trains run outside of the immediate area of major cities, and our rivers have become choked with vegetation. We must organize an aggressive expansion of railroad connections across the Empire, not just between urban areas but through the countryside to allow farmers and river fishers to bring their product to market. Roads must be modernized - preferably paved - and canals dug, repaired, and expanded throughout the nation. All of Germany must move as one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_the_netherlands_title;Liberate the Dutch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_the_netherlands_desc;The territory referred to by the Burgundians as the “Netherlands” once comprised much of the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia. It is here that the Dutch and the Frisians dwell, two German peoples estranged from the Empire for centuries. Not only did the Burgundian tyrants impose Protestantism upon them, they sought to deny the very nature of their culture and sever their German roots. They failed! The Dutch and the Frisians remember their homeland, just as we remember Lower Lotharingia, and now they are rediscovering their German ties. Now that the Empire has been fully reunified, we shall not lower the Reichskriegflagge until all West Germans are once again embraced by Holy Germania their mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Secret_police_HRE_title;Establish the Geheime Staatspolizei;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Secret_police_HRE_desc;The Imperial Police Service has brought order to our lands but even they cannot crack the terrorist organizations and other underground groups which plague the Empire. For that a different approach is required, one with more subtlety and even fewer restrictions upon their powers. This new Department of the Secret State Police shall be tasked with monitoring, infiltrating, and destroying revolutionary organizations within our lands. They will be given the power of arbitrary arrest and detention, and their operatives shall be trained in covert activity, clandestine interception of mail, and undercover work. If necessary they shall even follow revolutionaries abroad, as many of these terrorists have gone into exile in foreign cities. With the creation of the “GS” we can at last begin to wage war from the shadows against the revolutionary criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_burgundy_title;End the Treason of Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_burgundy_desc;The death of Henry the Venerable, the first Duke of Burgundy, in 1002 allowed the wicked King Robert II of France to seize the territory and rob it from the German cultural sphere. The following centuries saw Burgundy grow ever more arrogant, bloated,  and corrupt, until it reached its modern apogee of iniquity. They now think themselves equal, even superior, to the Emperor. Burgundy has tormented our people for generations! It was they who sparked the Religious Wars, they who struck down Wenceslaus V, they whose merchants fostered the Hollowing! THEY ARE TO BLAME. We have never forgotten this, and we will never forgive them...just as we have never forgotten that, for nearly all of its existence, Burgundy had been the western frontier of the Empire.

A confederal government shall be established across the German lands to rally them all beneath our banner, and nobody will ever again question the undeniably German soul of the Bohemians, nor our mandate to serve and protect our people.

light_the_phoenix_SGF_desc;Pan-Germanism is not what it used to be. Gone are the heady days of the 1830s and 1840s when it seemed that Germany was on the cusp of unity. There are still pan-Germanist parties but none of them agree, and they waste all of their energy squabbling with one another. Now a group of ministers have put forth a radical proposal to force the leading pan-Germanist parties into a temporary alliance. With enough cajoling, bribery, and blackmail, we can compel the most influential pan-Germanists to form a new umbrella organization to coordinate their efforts to unite Germany. It will undoubtedly be unstable but we have no choice! Germany must unite, and it must unite as soon as possible. We even have a name in mind for this group, named after the flag used by Marinus Dahlke’s Imperial Republic : The Reichsbanner Coalition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_phoenix_gambit_CAE_desc;Pan-Germanism is on the wane. There are still pan-Germanist parties but most of them operate in the Danubian lands. Now a group of ministers have put forth a radical proposal to initiate a pan-German propaganda campaign amongst the southerners while passing bribes to certain Danubian politicians to promote a pan-German political alliance. Such a seismic political shift could reawaken the pan-German spark within our own nation and then allow us to appropriate it. There is a significant risk of blowback but we have no choice! We must obtain a mandate to lead the German people once again. One minister has even suggested that we slip some cash to a German nationalist author for him to publish an anonymous pamphlet calling for a “Reichsbanner Coalition,” named for the flag of Marinus Dahlke’s republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

She is young and strong once again, and she will no longer tolerate Burgundy’s evil.\n\nA war with Burgundy will not be a skirmish for a single province. It will be a massive struggle to liberate all of Germany from their clutches and to destroy their power forever, so that nobody will ever live in fear of the Burgundian Lion again.

An ideology combining German romanticism and socialist economic critiques with strange theories of language and culture, the Volkists seek the establishment of an atheistic, militarized, pan-German state governed along their bizarre and despotic lines. The Danubian-based German National Volkist Party (DNVP) and its blackshirted Combat Division (Kampfabteilung, or KA) is the most popular and influential, with many copycats and sister organizations across Germany. Now the local Rhenish DNVP chapter has staged a demonstration in Frankfurt. Columns upon columns of blackshirts have marched through the streets, occasionally pausing to jeer religious or political offices they deemed “against the German spirit.” So far they have not actually harmed any people or property, but the mayor of Frankfurt has requested that we dispatch troops to defend the city in case of rioting as the city guard may be unable to stop the KA. The mood is quite tense…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP7.T;The Battle of Zeil Street;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP7.D;When the KA marched towards Frankfurt city center through Zeil Street - the same street where German republicans held a national revolutionary pledge in 1790 - they were met by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers who ordered them to disperse. Younger blackshirts began heckling the soldiers. Battalion commander Dwight Rethel demanded that his men be allowed to pass. What happened next is unclear. Commanding $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officer Rene van Buren claims that multiple Volkists drew handguns, forcing his men to open fire to defend themselves. The Volkists allege that none of them were carrying firearms and that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot them even after Rethel declared this. Whatever the case, a furious melee was ignited between the blackshirts and our forces that spilled out into other parts of the city. With several KA men dead, many Germans are inclined to believe Rethel, and German nationalist sentiment is flaring on a level not seen in decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP8.T;The Return of Pan-German Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP8.D;The wounds opened by the “Battle of Zeil Street” run far deeper than any of us had expected. Germans across Europe have awoken to find their morning newspapers splashed with headlines about unarmed German nationalists being shot down in the most politically significant location in Germany by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers seemingly just for being German nationalists. The militant and esoteric beliefs of the Volkists have done nothing to check a wave of outrage that is washing over the center of the continent. Not just in foreign countries, but in $COUNTRY$, people are recounting old German martyrs who also laid down their lives for Germany’s sake. Many Germans are now flocking to the Volkists, or alternatively to the Social Democratic Party of Germany, a far-left organization that sees German division as a tool of capitalism. Both pan-German parties are members of the Reichsbanner, and any hope of that coalition being short-lived have been lost, as the German specter haunts Europe once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP11.D;”He who comes not today, tomorrow surely comes, but slowly does the old oak awaken, and he who goes softly goes well.” - Bertolt Perienz, German author\nThe German Eagle has seen better days, and it is beyond question that it is the fault of those who held the Germans - those of the Rhein, of the Elbe, of the Donau, of Schwaben, of the Ostsee and of Dietsland - under their yoke. But in recent years, a whisper emerged in the dark alleys of the cities on the Rhine, then mumbling in the factories and stores of Danubia until even the Elbians, who usually submitted to the authority of Prague, joined the emerging chorus : Germany still exists! The dream carried by the descendants of those left behind in the Great German War will never die. The weakness of foreign empires has inspired a second national awakening across the former Holy Roman Empire which echoes throughout Europe.

GEP15.T;The Reichsbanner Calls for a Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP15.D;It is no secret that the Reichsbanner lacks much of a platform beyond pan-Germanism. Many people are still confused as to what it is, or what its broader goals are. None are more conflicted than its ostensible leadership, who cannot even agree on a coherent message for their own periodical! Now the Reichsbanner’s executive committee has called for a new Council of the Nations of Germany to be held in Innsbruck to decide upon a united political platform. It will no doubt be a contentious event, as parties from across the spectrum shall seek to make their policies the foundation of the Reichsbanner. §BIf our government is already leaning in a certain political direction then the Council shall reflect that direction. If not, then anything could happen.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP16.D;The Fourth Council of the German Nations has been organized in Innsbruck, site of the famous festival where German nationalism reawakened. The congress seeks to determine the political platform of the Reichsbanner Coalition. Parties from across the ideological spectrum have, for reasons of convenience, come together beneath this aegis for the sake of a united Germany. While it was thought that many voices would contend it already seems clear that the reactionaries shall dominate. The Danubian left has been disorganized as of late, more focused on squabbling with one another than presenting a united message. This has allowed right-wing parties to take control. The current favorite is the Jungdeutscher Orden (Young German Order), a coalition of the military and business elite backed by right-wing intellectuals and the middle class, led by General Erwin von Leeb. The Orden’s ferocious xenophobia and support of state-guided economics and welfare are proving quite popular and they are certain to take the lead in the Reichsbanner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Danubian right has been disorganized as of late, more focused on squabbling with one another than presenting a united message. This has allowed left-wing parties to take control. The current favorite is the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD), a coalition of worker and peasant interests focused around urban Räte (worker councils), led by trade unionist Otto Hayek. Their proletarian rhetoric is proving quite popular and they are certain to take the lead in the Reichsbanner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP17.A;The proletariat must rise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP18.T;The SPD and the Deutsche Bürgerarmee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP18.D;Socialist parties have existed in the German states for decades, but the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (Socialist Democratic Party of Germany, SPD) and its armed wing, the Deutsche Bürgerarmee (German Citizen Army) is the one most committed to pan-Germanism. The SPD is far more radical than most socialist parties, calling for a proletarian society governed by the workers’ councils (Räte) that have emerged across Germany during its industrialization, especially after the Hollowing. Their Bürgerarmee, though not as well-funded as right-wing paramilitaries, is fiercely loyal. The SPD also distinguishes itself by calling for German unity through a Blanquist lens, arguing that the German proletariat’s division is an artificial imposition by foreign capitalists. Their leader, Otto Hayek, is a veteran trade union activist and strike leader beloved by the lower classes as “one of our own - a man we can trust,” in the words of one local railworker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP18.A;We will keep an eye on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP19.T;The Deutsche Nationale Völkische Partei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP19.D;Volkism is a strange new ideology which marries socialist-sounding economic critiques and the rejection of conventional religion with violent ultranationalism and xenophobia. Supporters of German romanticism, government welfare, and industrial nationalization, the German National Volkist Party (DNVP) seeks to establish an atheistic, militarized, pan-German state, “from the English Channel to the Ostsee to the Adriatic, purged of Latin and Slavic degeneracy,” according to their manifesto. Their blackshirted Combat Division (Kampfabteilung, or KA) is a fearsome instrument of intimidation. Unlike more traditional reactionary parties the DNVP upholds the Dahlkist view of Ashkenazi Jews as fellow Germans. However many Jews, especially religious traditionalists, have declared this to be a self-serving policy of legitimizing the DNVP’s goals of foreign conquest. Their leader, Erich Laufen, is a former lecturer and military veteran, famous for his magnetizing speeches, strategic mind, and iron will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP19.A;We will keep an eye on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP20.T;The Jungdeutscher Orden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP20.D;The fall of the Empire and the return of Dahlkism prompted much soul-searching amongst German reactionaries. It became clear to them that the old order had failed. Yet the nobility, as cunning and supine as ever, have refurbished their message for a new era, cherry-picking aspects of republicanism and socialism convenient to them. Thus a new political party has arisen : the Jungdeutscher Orden (Young German Order), comprised of military officers and veterans, businessmen, and right-wing intellectuals. While the Orden and its Stahlhelm paramilitary espouse pan-Germanism and the importance of state welfare - policies once seen as leftist - it combines this with ferocious racial and religious prejudice, hateful of “the Judeo-Blanquist hydra.” In the words of the Orden’s leader, the charismatic and young (compared to other officers) General Erwin von Leeb, they seek “a fully German, fully Catholic, and fully armed Germany.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Parties from across the ideological spectrum have, for reasons of convenience, come together beneath this aegis for the sake of a united Germany. Many voices shall contend but only one will enshrine itself as the official word of the Reichsbanner. The Danubian government will doubtlessly seek to influence these proceedings towards their own ends. §RFavoring one side will build a more stable coalition but could allow them to impose their political will across all of Germany in the future.

GEP22.D;The outcome of the Second German Council has failed to satisfy the pan-Germanist question. A Third Council has thus been organized in Innsbruck, site of the famous liberal festival where German nationalism reawakened.

GEP23.T;The Question of the Räte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP23.D;Räte (councils) are a type of urban labor organization which have grown in popularity since the late 19th century. Originally formed to coordinate strikes, the räte have become an autonomous workers’ movement across Germany. This is a striking departure from previous labor unions and other worker organizations which, at least in Germany, were almost always state-controlled. Räte have been springing up from Amsterdam to Vienna, organizing meetings at the factory level. They not only lead strikes but coordinate political action, run workers’ cooperatives, and run educational programs. Now some Räte have begun to seize foreign-owned factories and the Reichsbanner must decide how to approach them. The SPD advocates full partnership with the Räte and to use them as the blueprints of a new nation. Reactionaries see them as a symptom of poor state leadership and argue that industrial nationalization is the cure. Most moderates support their cooperatives but shun more militant Räte actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP23.A;§VThe Räte shall be the backbone of a proletarian Germany!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP23.B;Endorse workers’ cooperatives and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP24.T;The Question of Political Amnesty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,#Fascist
GEP24.D;Many German political activists have been imprisoned over the years. In $COUNTRY$ and elsewhere these men and women were jailed for speaking their mind and fighting for their cause. Both Laufen and Hayek have served time in prison. Now, many Reichsbanner members are wondering : if we come to power, first in this country and then across all of Germany, what shall be done with these political prisoners? The SPD and the DNVP both want to keep their respective political enemies locked up, the SPD against anticommunists and religious extremists, the DNVP against anarchists. Moderates argue that we cannot lay claim to Marinus Dahlke’s legacy if we do not free all political prisoners, as he often did upon capturing cities during the Revolution. §RIf this issue is not settled then it could cause serious instability in the future.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP25.T;The Question of the New German Army’s Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,#Nonfascist
GEP25.D;We aim to unify Germany and experience has shown that none of the European Great Powers will allow this without a fight. Therefore the Reichsbanner is now debating the nature of the prospective pan-German military. The SPD, pointing to the ancient ties between the reactionary nobility and the officer corps of European states, has argued that only by allowing soldiers to elect their own officers can the German military avoid becoming a breeding ground for despotism. The Orden, itself comprised of many military or ex-military men, is affronted by this and has declared that our only priority should be keeping our armed forces “apolitical” - which would amount to the muzzling of any Blanquist voices within it. Moderates agree that the old system of purchased commissions must end but see patriotism as the only political requirement for the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP25.A;§VMilitary democracy will keep Germany free!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP25.C;§uThe last thing our heroes need is idle red gossip in their ears.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP26.T;The Question of Paramilitaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP26.D;Paramilitaries have become a fact of life across Germany, as many radical parties feel the need to both protect themselves from state persecution and from their rivals. They have also become a haven for military veterans. As we lay the foundations of a new German state, the Reichsbanner must determine their fate. Both the SPD and the DNVP have argued for the dissolution of their opposite number’s paramilitary. The matter has become heated with members of the Bürgerarmee and the Kampfabteilung hurling accusations of past misdeeds - several Council attendees have fought one another in the streets in prior years. Most moderates see paramilitary forces in general as a threat to civil liberty and want all of them dissolved. However a few eccentric delegates have suggested the formation of a united “Reichsbannerarmee” that would merge all existing paramilitaries into a single organization. §RThis would create an extremely fractious force.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP26.A;§VThe KA cannot be trusted to protect the proletariat, dissolve them!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP27.T;The Question of Welfare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP27.D;The Hollowing illustrated the consequences of a Germany without a united government to direct relief efforts and shield the German people. The passage of time has only strengthened the conviction across the political spectrum that state welfare programs are a necessary part of modern life. Both the SPD and the DNVP have different welfare plans. The SPD want to build upon existing reforms to further protect German workers and farmers, but with the provision of aid working through local Räte. The DNVP argues that the current welfare scheme is too broken to be saved and must be totally replaced with a state-run regime of programs centrally controlled from the capital. Moderates worry that the Council is losing sight of pan-Germanism and want to leave the matter be for the short term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP27.A;§VA proletarian society must protect its members!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP27.B;We have other concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP27.C;§uA new German order will need a new welfare scheme!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP28.T;The Question of the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP28.D;Hard questions are being asked amongst the Reichsbanner delegates as to the Head of State of a future German nation. The Danubian government was built through the efforts of monarchs who co-opted German nationalism, but German nationalism first arose as a Dahlkist and therefore anti-monarchist ideology. The SPD sees this appropriation as a mistake to be corrected through abolition of the monarchy, though they concede that mass execution of the ruling dynasty may not be necessary. The Orden, many of whose members are of noble blood, see the monarchy as a fundamental pillar of the state - General von Leeb has described the idea of abolishing it to build a new Germany as “like passengers on a moving train casting out the conductor and the engineer due to disliking their temperaments.” Moderates agree that abolition could be too destabilizing at this time and instead propose that the future German constitution relegate the monarch to a ceremonial role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP28.A;§VOnly a republican Germany will be a free Germany!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP28.B;Endorse a symbolic monarch and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP28.C;§uAll republics fail and fall. Where is Dahlke now?§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP29.T;The Question of the Presidency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP29.D;Hard questions are being asked amongst the Reichsbanner delegates as to the Head of State of a future German nation. The Danubian government is moderated by a president who wields several powers to guide the government in the name of stability, but successive presidents have claimed greater and greater authority. The SPD see the executive branch as redundant and wish to abolish the presidency. The Orden, in contrast, claim that only a strong executive can provide the necessary national leadership - General von Leeb has described the idea of abolishing the presidency to build a new Germany as “like passengers on a moving train casting out the conductor and the engineer due to disliking their temperaments.” Moderates agree that abolition could be too destabilizing at this time and instead propose that the future German constitution scale back presidential powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP29.C;§uAn army needs a strong leader and so does a nation!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP30.T;The Question of the Legal System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP30.D;For most of German history the justices have been appointed by local authorities. Even the old Reichshofrat, the highest court in the Empire, was appointed by the Emperor. Now this system is being questioned by Reichsbanner delegates. The SPD has pointed to the old system as yet another way in which the bourgeoisie defend their privileges and has argued that the Räte should elect justices to ensure they represent the people. The DNVP has attacked this proposition as a naked attempt to politicize judicial appointments and has argued that such matters should be handled by a national German Ministry of Justice. Most moderates see both suggestions as flawed and would prefer that legislatures handle judicial elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP30.A;§VThe Räte will decide who is fit to wield a gavel!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP30.B;Endorse legislature elections for justices and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP30.C;§uWhat we need is to centralize judicial appointments!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP31.T;The Question of the Form of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP31.D;If the Reichsbanner is to build a new Germany then it must decide what type of Germany to build. That is the realization which has ignited the most furious debates amongst the delegates. It has also caused SPD unity to fray, as several members have come out in support of the Jungdeutscher Orden’s demand for a unitary, centrally organized state. These SPD defectors argue that without centralization, Germany will not be able to maintain its cohesion. After all, they ask, did the Empire not perish due to lack of centralization? SPD leader Otto Hayek has condemned this line of reasoning, defending a federal model as the only one which can protect democracy and give the Räte a meaningful voice, even if it is less stabilizing than a unitary system. Most of the Council appears to be cleaving along one of these two lines, though a third group has emerged which seeks an even more decentralized government to avert any possibility of state tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP31.A;§pA unitary state will unite Germany and keep it united!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP36.D;The parties of the Reichsbanner - especially the SPD and the DNVP - have somehow managed to conclude the Fourth German Council without any ideology coming to the fore of the debate. All parties, even the most radical amongst the far-left and the far-right, have maintained their attempts to keep united in the name of Germany. However cracks have already begun to appear : nobody, not even Hayek and Laufen, could decide on who would give the final speech of the evening, and instead all major parties gave brief addresses. §pIt is likely that the Reichsbanner will be able to keep itself together until Germany is united.

We must not shrink from our destiny because of a minor difference of programs! This Council was called in the name of unity, and unity we shall have. Comrades! In the name of Germany, we must all stride forwards together, as one body with a single unbreakable will!”\n\nThe parties of the Reichsbanner have managed to bury enough of their differences to be willing to officially commit to a broad political alliance. While many differences still exist amongst the coalition’s members, all major participants have promised to do their utmost to submerge these differences for the time being. It is hoped that this historic compromise shall be a model for political stability in Germany going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP38.D;”The wheel of history turns on inexorably, but it is the struggle of the common people which turns it. Today a fire has been kindled here that shall light the heart of the continent. It is the beacon of a new world - a new humanity - a new Germany. We shall all bear its light onwards.” - SPD leader Otto Hayek\n\nThe SPD has promised to do what it can to aid the Reichsbanner. While this represents a victory for political stability, some attendees were disappointed that the SPD did not offer a firmer commitment of support.

It is through our combined might that she shall be liberated. And soon, she shall once more draw her sword against our enemies.”\n\nThe reactionary parties have promised to do what they can to aid the Reichsbanner.

GEP40.D;It was expected that one of the leaders of the reactionary parties in attendance would deliver one of the final speeches at the council. But to the shock of all delegates, they instead led their parties in a walkout! Many anti-communists and traditionalists joined them. It appears that the Reichsbanner’s political platform has shifted too far from the right for them to support. We shall have to move forward without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP41.D;It was expected that Otto Hayek, leader of the SPD and thus one of the most influential leftists in attendance, would deliver one of the final speeches at the council. But to the shock of all delegates, he instead led his party in a walkout! Many communists and other Blanquist radicals joined them. It appears that the Reichsbanner’s political platform has shifted too far from the left for them to support. We shall have to move forward without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP42.T;The Nation Embraces the Reichsbanner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP42.D;The conclusion of the Fourth German Council did far more than bolster pan-German nationalism. Many people across $COUNTRY$ now see the victory of the Reichsbanner as a necessity for the future of Germany. Fearing a revolution if the energized masses were not mollified, this morning the government issued an announcement of its “unrestrained support” for the Reichsbanner and promised to work with the coalition “for the salvation of Germany.” This amounts to placing guidance of the nation in their hands, something which has shocked both Europe and the world at large. Far more shocking was the announcement that the “national liberation of Germany by all possible means” shall become “the foremost priority of the administration,” news which has caused our foreign allies to quickly sever ties with us. §pThis is tantamount to a declaration of war against all other rivals for German unification. A conflict for the fate of Germany is not just inevitable - it is now imminent.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP45.D;”Men do not lead the revolution : it is the Revolution that uses men.” - Ariel Arendt, ‘Considerations on Germany,’ 1796\n\nThe Reichsbanner Coalition, a broad alliance of pan-German political parties, have through peace or force compelled the Danubian government to bend to their wishes. This has led to the outbreak of war and insurrection across Germany, as Danubian soldiers strike north against Scandinavia to bring both north and south under their control. The Nordic realm has already seen its Elbian lands plagued by partisan warfare but this has opened up a whole new phase in the conflict. If Scandinavia prevails then this shall spell the death of pan-Germanism for generations. If the Danubians prevail then it could merely be the overture of an even greater struggle to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This has led to the outbreak of war and insurrection across Germany, as Danubian soldiers strike north against Prague to bring both north and south under their control. The Bohemians have already seen their northern lands plagued by partisan warfare but this has opened up a whole new phase in the conflict. The battles which play out here to settle the decades-old vendetta between the ancient claimant to the German mantle and the upstart contender may be a mere overture of an even greater struggle to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP47.T;The Treaty of Nuremberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP47.D;The German Phoenix continues to soar above Europe, as Danubian forces have swept Scandinavian armies from northern Germany and compelled Kopenhagen to surrender rather than face further bloodshed. The resulting treaty, signed in Nuremberg - the “Phoenix City,” as some pan-Germanists call it, due to its burning by Bohemian troops in the past - has ejected Scandinavia from the Elbian lands. Nordicism, the idea of Scandinavia and northern Germany as a single entity, has been obliterated, the Scandinavian government humiliated both at home and abroad. As German unification advances by leaps and bounds, Scandinavia has lost the linchpin of its foreign policy and thus has found itself in the worst political crisis since the collapse of the Unionster Party. Burgundy, the other major power with interests in Germany, is sure to react decisively to this news to shield its eastern frontier. The destiny of the old Realm of the North is unknown, but the destiny of Germany seems clearer with each passing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP48.D;The German Phoenix continues to soar above Europe, as Danubian forces have swept Elbian armies from northern Germany and compelled Prague to surrender rather than face further bloodshed. The resulting treaty, signed in Nuremberg - the “Phoenix City,” as some pan-Germanists call it, due to its burning by Bohemian troops in the past - has finally avenged that atrocity by assigning all Elbian lands beyond the Bohemian core to the Danubians. Any pretense of Bohemia as a foundation for a new German or even Elbian identity has been obliterated, with the Elbian union state crumbling into dust and the Danubians claiming all its overseas possessions. As German unification advances by leaps and bounds, the Bohemians have been once more relegated to obscurity. Burgundy, the other major power with interests in Germany, is sure to react decisively to this news to shield its eastern frontier. The destiny of the Bohemian Lion is unknown, but the destiny of Germany seems clearer with each passing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP49.T;The Reichsbanner Marches On!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP49.D;At last! The centuries of German servitude beneath the yoke of the northerners have been avenged, and the Germans of the Elbe reunited with those of the Danube. The Reichsbanner Coalition has won a tremendous victory, but we cannot rest yet. Western Germany remains estranged, and the Burgundians will surely fight to the death to defend their power in the region if they are able. They might even take extraordinary measures to shore up their defenses…At any rate, northern Germany will take time to integrate, and there is also the matter of separatist militias which we will have to root out. It is hoped that the Reichsbanner will keep the political situation steady. §RIf we have not built a stable coalition, however, then the integration of the north could provoke a political crisis.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP49.A;§pThe Befreiungskrieg beckons.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP50.T;An Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP50.D;The Danubians, under the leadership of the pan-German Reichsbanner terrorists, have ignited a new revolution which has plunged Germany into anarchy. If they are not stopped then the whole of Central Europe shall fall beneath the shadow of their tyranny. However, this storm cloud over the continent has a silver lining. For decades we have been seeking to fully integrate our territories in the east and west with the Burgundian core, but the necessary political conditions have never arisen. That is no longer the case. The threat of an aggressive and pan-German government in the east could allow us to rally the disparate peoples beneath our protection into a single, united realm. We may not get another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP50.A;Call the cabinet, we have a proclamation to draft…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP51.T;The Treaty of Brunn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP51.D;The dream of Innsbruck, of German unity, has been usurped by the old masters of Germany. The Danubian offensive into the north was a disastrous failure and now the Reichsbanner must pay the price. A treaty has been signed in Brunn - a small Moravian town notable only for its obscurity - which has put an end to $COUNTRY$. The Reichsbanner’s Executive Committee have been branded terrorists by the installed pro-Bohemian regime and will soon be tried (and likely executed) for their actions. $COUNTRY$ itself has been placed under occupation by $FROMCOUNTRY$. Rumors are swirling that $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends not to divide the Danubians back into Austria and Bavaria, but to absorb the southern German state into itself to build its own pan-German government founded on less radical principles. Europe cannot sleep soundly yet, as the German phoenix has fallen from the sky only for the roar of the Bohemian Lion to echo across the continent anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP51.A;Deutschland uber alles…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP52.T;The Formation of the German Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP52.D;When the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was dissolved decades past,  it was assumed to mark the exit of Bohemia from international relevance. Rumors of Bohemian decline, it seems, have been greatly exaggerated. The victory of Prague over the Reichsbanner Coalition of the Danubians has given its leadership the momentum to usurp their vanquished foes’ plans and proclaim a new German Confederation! Its constitution, as later ratified by the Diet, has divided the realm into administrative units structured around language and culture rather than old political boundaries. It will of course take time for the newly united Germany to consolidate itself. Burgundy, the other major power with interests in Germany, is sure to react decisively to this news to shield its eastern frontier - war between these powers seems inevitable. The destiny of the Bohemian Lion and the destiny of Germany have once again become intertwined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP52.A;Germania, we have returned to thee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP53.T;The Treaty of Wurzburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP53.D;The end of the Great German Revolution has been no end at all. Whether through mutual exhaustion or foreign intervention, all involved parties have come together in the city of Wurzburg to draft a peace treaty. Its only term of note is the the dismantling of the Reichsbanner Coalition and the prosecution of its Executive Committee. Foreign empires - especially Burgundy and Scandinavia - breathe a sigh of relief as pan-German nationalism has once again been defanged, this time perhaps for good. This could allow the more ambitious imperialists to claim unprecedented hegemony in Germany. With the failure of the Reichsbanner it is difficult to foresee how German unification will arise now. Perhaps a new movement shall emerge in the future, but at present the German destiny remains inscrutable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP53.A;What was all of this sacrifice for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP54.T;The End of the Great German Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP54.D;We have weathered the Reichsbanner storm, and regained control over our territories around the Elbe. Pan-German militias are being rooted out and the political situation seems to be stabilizing. However the notion of pan-Germanism also appears to be shattering, at least in the short term, and any projects which our nation may have planned to embark upon involving that doctrine are now impossible. Furthermore the political vacuum in Germany could embolden the Burgundians to cement their control over the Rhine and Swabia if they have the ability to do so. All in all let us hope that this brings Europe peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP54.A;Once again, we pray for the fallen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP55.T;The German Phoenix Calls Upon Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP55.D;The Reichsbanner Coalition amongst the Danubians has recently concluded a conference in Innsbruck where they have laid out their plans for a unified German state. They have garnered so much support from the citizens of $FROMCOUNTRY$ that it is now preparing for a campaign to unite Germany. Its representatives have exhorted us to join forces with them, assuring us that the new German state shall respect Elbian culture. Much of our populace is inclined to accept their request for our annexation in the hopes of building a new Germany. §RGiven the strength of their position and the fanaticism of the Reichsbanner, refusing their offer and defending our independence with force MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP55.A;No more brothers’ wars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP55.B;§RBy God, no, Danubian scum.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP56.T;The Unthinkable Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP56.D;When the Reichsbanner gained preeminence within $COUNTRY$, our government extended its hand in friendship and brotherhood to $FROMCOUNTRY$, asking them to join our nation so that we could build a united Germany together. We made sure to include copious assurances that their laws and culture would be respected. Yet STILL they scorned us! We cannot tolerate this - they have done more than just dishonor us, they have dishonored Mother Germania herself! Only one course lays open for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP56.A;§RTHE NORTH WILL PAY FOR ITS HUBRIS.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP57.T;The German Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP57.D;When the Reichsbanner Coalition, buoyed by popular support, pressured the Danubian government into announcing its intent to unify Germany, it was thought that the Elbian state to the north would quickly join forces with them. Instead all German nationalists were horrified to learn that the Elbians had rejected the Danubian request to merge their nations. Be it out of fear of losing control of their institutions or more recent grudges, Germany’s cultural divide between the High south and the Low north have never been more stark. Mother Germania weeps as her sons once again draw swords against one another for her own sake. Will the fanatical Reichsbanner cement their right to bear the German standard or will the upstart Elbians usurp them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP57.A;For the German destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP58.T;Victory of the Danubians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP58.D;As expected by most international observers, the Reichsbanner triumphed over its northern rival. Despite initial fury at the Elbian government’s defiance, the Danubians did not waste time enacting reprisals against the common people. Once the old administration had been swept away, the formal reunification of north with south was proclaimed. Pains have been taken to defend Elbian religious and cultural institutions, at least to the extent of preventing a partisan uprising. For now $COUNTRY$ must work to heal the damage of the civil war and consolidate its new lands - but when this is accomplished, all of Europe shall witness the final rebirth of the German Phoenix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP58.A;It cannot come soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP590.T;Victory of the Elbians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP590.D;To the shock of international observers, the Reichsbanner and the Danubians writ large have been defeated by the Elbians of the north. All of the fanaticism in the world could not overcome the strategic brilliance of $COUNTRY$ which managed to turn the tables on its rival. Despite initial fury at the Danubian government’s aggression, the Elbians did not waste time enacting reprisals against the common people. Once the old administration had been swept away, the formal reunification of south with north was proclaimed - it seems that the Elbians have assumed the Reichsbanner’s mantle. Pains have been taken to defend Danubian religious and cultural institutions, at least to the extent of preventing a partisan uprising. For now $COUNTRY$ must work to heal the damage of the civil war and consolidate its new lands - but when this is accomplished, all of Europe shall witness the final rebirth of the German Phoenix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP590.A;It cannot come soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP59.T;The Elbian Reichsbanner Putsch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP59.D;The inability of $COUNTRY$ to force its northern rival to submit to its leadership disturbed the Reichsbanner Coalition. Fearing the collapse of the pan-German dream, they took action into their own hands, calling upon sympathizers within the Elbian government. Pan-Germanist officers within the Elbian military mustered their forces to the capital, where they declared the old government dissolved and ordered all Elbian units still in the field to stand down. This has delivered the Elbian union state to the southerners, but not without cost. The power of the Reichsbanner continues to grow and the dependence of $FROMCOUNTRY$ upon it as well. For now $COUNTRY$ must work to heal the damage of the civil war and consolidate its new lands - but when this is accomplished, all of Europe shall witness the final rebirth of the German Phoenix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP59.A;It cannot come soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP60.T;Rumors of Instability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP60.D;We have secured control over northern Germany but we cannot rest upon our laurels. The lands of the Elbe and the Weser have been abused and neglected for centuries, and the recent wars in the north have not helped matters. Ominous reports are filtering back to us of rising cultural and economic tensions in the Elbian territories. These stories are in turn fueling unrest and uncertainty in the Danubian homeland, especially in the capital. Worst of all, with German unification now a virtual certainty, Reichsbanner unity is beginning to fray as the different coalition parties realize that not all of them will be able to implement their policies. This was easy to think about in abstract back in Innsbruck but it is now causing friction amongst major political personalities. Perhaps this will all blow over - but we must be prepared if it does not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP60.A;We will face the future together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP61.T;The Reichsbanner Remains United!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP61.D;The cynics who forecast the disintegration of the Reichsbanner Coalition have been disproved. Unity among pan-Germanists has persisted even after the liberation of northern Germany, and isolated incidents of unrest amongst the Elbians have been dealt with by regional authorities. Now that we have cleared that mighty hurdle we can turn our attention to building up Germany - for our struggle is not over yet. The Burgundians are the power with the most to lose from a united Germany and they shall never allow us to exist without one last desperate attempt to destroy us. At the same time they continue to hold many Germans in their clutches. We must prepare for the final conflict for Germany’s soul, a war that shall be greater and more terrible than any other : §RThe Befreiungskrieg.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,’

GEP62.T;Assassination of the President;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP62.D;Yesterday, President Johan Brandt was touring Stettin, recently liberated by the Danubians and the Reichsbanner. It was an unexpectedly warm day and so the President decided to ride in an open cab. As his convoy turned onto the Stettin main street, a shot rang out from the Stettin School Book Depository, then two more. The driver raced down a side street to escape the ambush, but the President’s guards soon confirmed their worst fears : Brandt, the charismatic centrist, was dead. The assassin, one Adolf Wilhelm Honecker, was arrested at the Stettin Theater later that day, only to be fatally shot by Kit Kat nightclub owner George Lang on his way into the capital courthouse for his arraignment this morning. This tragedy has ignited fury between the left and the right as both have accused each other of orchestrating Brandt’s murder and then killing Honecker to hinder the investigation. The truth may never be known but the Reichsbanner, once united, is now dividing with terrible speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP62.A;We must not let this crisis tear us apart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP620.T;Assassination of the Bundespräsidium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP620.D;Yesterday, Bundespräsidium Amadeus I was touring Stettin, recently liberated by the Danubians and the Reichsbanner. It was an unexpectedly warm day and so His Majesty decided to ride in an open cab. As his convoy turned onto the Stettin main street, a shot rang out from the Stettin School Book Depository, then two more. The driver raced down a side street to escape the ambush, but the royal guards soon confirmed their worst fears : Amadeus, the charismatic centrist, was dead. The assassin, one Adolf Wilhelm Honecker, was arrested at the Stettin Theater later that day, only to be fatally shot by Kit Kat nightclub owner George Lang on his way into the capital courthouse for his arraignment this morning. This tragedy has ignited fury between the left and the right as both have accused each other of orchestrating the Bundespräsidium’s murder and then killing Honecker to hinder the investigation. The truth may never be known but the Reichsbanner, once united, is now dividing with terrible speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP620.A;We must not let this crisis tear us apart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP63.T;The Danubian Royal Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP63.D;It had been expected that, upon Bundespräsidium Amadeus I’s death, his son and heir the Crown Prince Helmuth would succeed him. This is no longer possible. The Danubian ruling family had assembled at the royal palace, and for the sake of their privacy many of the staff were dismissed. While a security cordon was imposed the Crown Prince himself was allowed through for obvious reasons. It was only when nobody left the palace for over twelve hours that the guards thought to check in on them. What they found was horrific. Crown Prince Helmuth had shot and killed his mother Queen Septimia, his siblings, and two of his uncles, before turning his weapon upon himself. Monarchists immediately alleged that the killings were another conspiracy but with Helmuth dead it seems the truth may never be known. The Reichsbanner-dominated Landtag has taken this opportunity to pass a new Danubian constitution replacing the monarch with an elected president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP63.A;The madness only spirals deeper…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP64.T;Die Vereinigungskrise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP64.D;The liberation of northern Germany and the assassination of the Head of State has caused our political situation to explode. The Reichsbanner’s left and right wings have abandoned all pretense of cooperation with the death of the man who had been hailed as the lodestone of domestic unity, as well as the influx of a whole second nation’s worth of people and problems. The government bureaucracy is beyond overstretched trying to govern both the Danubian heartland and the Elbian territories. Many northern communities are wracked by ethnic and religious unrest, not to mention economic stress. With the left and the right competing for state resources and using relief measures as political bargaining chips, the situation is degrading more and more with each passing day. §RWe are entering a decisive period in our history, a time in which anything could happen. Our government must be careful : every act shall bring us closer to either revolution or collapse, unless we can restore balance.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP64.A;Whatever happened to bipartisanship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP65.T;The Language Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP65.D;The first problem facing our government is that of language. We cannot commence aid efforts if people cannot even understand the signs and documents our government uses for everyday functions. Unfortunately the German language - or languages - has undergone great drift along geographical lines over the centuries. Reactionaries believe that the Danubian German tongue is the one with the least foreign influences and therefore the “purest” form of German, and that we should impose it as the sole national standard. Leftists see German linguistic diversity as something to celebrate and even promote, although they too want to use Danubian for government business. Most civil servants think that implementing bilingualism on a regional basis would be enough, though politicians on both the left and right see this as treating symptoms rather than the root cause of the dilemma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP65.A;§VLet all the German proletariat speak in their own way!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP65.B;Ensure that everyone knows basic Danubian and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP65.C;§uDanubian German IS German. Everything else is mere noise.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP66.T;The Administration Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP66.D;We have begun to stabilize our rule in northern Germany, but resources are still insufficient to meet the demands placed upon us by its chaotic state. The region has seen great political upheaval and governing it all directly from the capital with ad-hoc local regimes is no longer enough if we want to actually integrate the Elbians. Leftists suggest co-opting the Räte that have mushroomed across the north, giving them limited governmental powers in exchange for their assistance. Reactionaries argue that supporting the Junkers (nobles) and merchants of the north, the traditional elites, is the swiftest way to restore order. Moderates believe that the Elbians will calm down if they can exercise their own democratic voice, and that we should schedule new local elections across the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP66.A;§VThe Räte are the true voices of the people!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP66.B;Ensure new northern elections and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP66.C;§uThe Junkers protected the Elbe for centuries, we can trust them.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP67.T;The Paramilitary Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP67.D;Despite the Fourth German Council’s resolution to address paramilitaries, the Bürgerarmee and the Stahlhelm are as restless as ever. Both groups continue to recruit followers and harass their political enemies, a practice all the more destructive owing to the already-damaged state of northern Germany. They have even begun to once more brawl with each other! Action must be taken before they grow bold enough to attempt a putsch, or worse, ignite a civil war. While many people have called upon the government to pass a unilateral ban on paramilitaries, both forces have well-connected allies. Furthermore, while we could use an executive decree to order their immediate dissolution, this would be seen as an erosion of democracy. Perhaps we should only focus on the more threatening group, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP67.A;§VThe proletariat are our allies, we must disarm the rightists.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP67.B;Order the dissolution of all paramilitaries, nothing less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP67.C;§uThe elites are our allies, we must disarm the leftists.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP68.T;The Threat of Separatist Militias;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP68.D;Not everybody in northern Germany welcomed our rule. Some want to carve our their own independent states, be they relics of the past or new fantasies. Others wish to split us in half and create an independent Elbian German nation. Still others were loyal to the old imperial powers of the region, and fight for either their restoration or at least to prevent punishment for their actions. Whatever their reasons, separatist militias are plaguing northern Germany and the local authorities are overwhelmed. However many militias have an ideological bent as well, be it left or right. Therefore both the SPD and the DNVP had advocated to offer amnesty to certain militias (each favoring those who align with themselves) in exchange for their cooperation in suppressing the rest. Moderates however are fearful of the precedent that this would set and demand a universal crackdown on separatists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP68.A;§VAny friend of the proletariat is our friend as well.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP68.B;Criminals are criminals and nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP68.C;§uAny friend of the Volk is our friend as well.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP69.T;The Threat of Rural Banditry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEP69.D;We have made progress in rooting out separatist militias. However the focus on fighting partisans has lessened our efforts to revive the northern economy. Furthermore as large militias have been shattered, survivors have deserted them to strike out on their own. This has led to a rise in banditry across rural northern Germany, with its roads, canals, and railways becoming the hunting grounds for gangs of armed robbers. Reactionaries have pointed to this disorder as proof that we need a national police force, with broad powers and connected to the military, that can crush these criminals. Moderates agree that a national police is needed but are hesitant to condone what would, according to DNVP proposals, essentially be a domestic army used against our own citizens. Leftists have described the very concept of a national police as despotic and have instead petitioned for us to organize farmer Räte to conduct armed patrols in affected areas, a proposal which has horrified the DNVP.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Yet the conservatives remained as sluggish and inert as ever, and the red rag disgraced our streets. Thus the Young German Order has acted. Only manly discipline - unconditional subordination to selfless leaders guided only by their public spirit, relegation of our own thoughts, and confidence in the State and the Military - can guarantee that the moral force of the individual shall be aggregated into a power that will affect the redemption of the nation and the Fatherland. If there is any un-Germanness in and about us, it can only have come from a lack of racial sense, in defeatist thinking and, finally, in the advancement of the foreign peoples within our boundaries.

It seems that this was unfounded. The so-called “Unification Crisis” has been resolved for the moment, and the Danubian German administration in the north has coalesced into a unified system. The Reichsbanner Coalition has persevered.. In spite of all of the challenges which fate has hurtled at the government, it has endured in the name of a united Germany. At least at present. Many Germans are embittered by the extreme measures that the Danubian government went to in order to crush the radical threat, and feel the administration went too far. Whispers continue to allege that the current state of calm is an illusion, sustained only by the common threat of the Burgundians to the west. §RIf that threat is removed - or, worse, if the Reichsbanner falters in the final struggle for German freedom - the consequences could be catastrophic.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEP78.D;Many members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ General Staff believe that the Befreiungskrieg - the war to liberate all German peoples under Burgundian dominion and to shatter their power forever - will be a quick affair. They claim that all we have to do is reach northern Burgundy and the Dutch, Frisians, and Rhenish Germans shall arise to greet us. They say that the war will be “over before the next Christmastime.” But one general - Heinrich Vorbeck - disagrees. He has written an internal memorandum in which he asserts that the Befreiungskrieg will be unlike any war ever conducted in human history.  The advancement of military technology, he argues, has granted modern armies unprecedented powers of lethality, backed by massive industrial and economic complexes. It will be a total war, a war mobilizing the entirety of our population for the war effort. §RHe has implored our national leadership to only begin the war if it feels that our nation can shoulder such a burden.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Bund also rejects collaboration with bourgeois Jews in the major liberal parties, and in fact with any Jewish organization with religious or conservative views. At the heart of the Bund is the idea that there is no contradiction between the national aspect on the one hand and the socialist aspect on the other, rejecting even Hebrew in favor of Yiddish.

Now that a leftist coalition has achieved a majority, they are attempting to curtail the power of the executive in the hopes of establishing a more equal, equitable, and just system. This bill would also replace the infamous “Rot-Schwartz-Rot” flag, long seen as a symbol of conservative nationalism owing to its Bohemian influences, with the more liberal “Phönix-Flagge.” However there are those even within the governing party who feel a strong executive is necessary to preserve stability, as well as those who either have grown attached to our current flag or who dislike its proposed replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The disgraceful Treaty of Venice cleaved away lands which we have rightfully ruled for ages. Only the threat of war against most of Europe compelled us to temporarily withdraw from the duchy. But now, we have recovered sufficient strength to declare that article of the treaty to be void, and reclaim the east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_bohemian_problem_czechs_desc;Czechia has been liberated, but the legacy of the Ostsiedlung persists all around us. For centuries, German has been the language of our rulers. It surrounds us, on street signs, on legal documents, on the pages of our children’s textbooks. We must address the status of the Germans within our nation, and decide whether we will strive for a bilingual (but Czech-controlled) society, or adopt…other policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

liberation_of_slovaks_desc;The Slovaks, a people whose language, religion, and temperament are closest to our own, have long been oppressed by foreign rulers. It is only now that the Slovak cultural consciousness has even begun to awaken. We cannot wait for the Slovak patriots to take action. We must bring liberty to Slovakia ourselves! After all, many Czech sovereigns of the past considered Slovakia a natural part of their domain. Let us lay the groundwork for the liberation of all Western Slavs, and strike another blow for our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

protector_take_out_krakow_desc;The existence of the Free State of Krakow is a threat to our attempts to support our own claimant to the Polish mantle. Small as they are, they are still a gathering place for hostile Polish nationalists, and could potentially be used by foreign powers to build an alternative base of support for a new Polish nation. Thankfully, few foreign countries recognize the Free State of Krakow, so we can simply crush them ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

protector_take_out_krakow_desc;More than one warlord state was born out of the wreckage of the Commonwealth which claims the Polish legacy.

It is true that our people have never been truly united, but now is the perfect time to foster that unity! Let all of our nations be joined together into one family, one mighty land where the Western Slavs can orchestrate their own destiny! Long live Venedia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_elephant_in_prague_desc;Bohemia has lost its Imperial glory, but has stubbornly remained part of the European political order, bolstered by its vast population, incredible mineral wealth, and prosperous industry. So long as Bohemia remains strong, there will always be the threat of them challenging us for the mantle of Germany’s savior. Yet Bohemia has a weakness : the Czechs. Let us reach out to the Czech nationalists, especially the Young Czechia movement, and support their cause against Bohemia’s rulers.

CAEP1.D;The constitution of $COUNTRY$ has been finished, ready for signing and ratification. We have been forced to make various concessions to politicians on both the left and right during its drafting to prevent discord.

Furthermore all “Royal Estates” - the various princes (and, technically speaking, free cities) of the nation - shall be permitted to maintain their own domestic codes. The loss of Brandenburg and other parts of Germany is painful but Bohemia’s vast population and political preeminence will still allow us to dominate the Confederation. Our overriding concern now is building a national identity. To put it bluntly, our new nation, divided by both dialect and religion, needs a reason to exist, ideally by committing to a political alignment : reform, reaction, or revolution. §RIf we do not discover such a reason for unification, then revolutionaries may tear us apart.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEP9.D;An ethnically Czech unit in Prague was in the midst of their Utraquist religious service when their German Catholic officer stormed in and demanded they halt at once to be deployed against the Danubians. Things might have ended there if the officer hadn’t snatched a locket with an image of Jan Hus from the neck of the unit’s chaplain and thrown it against the wall in anger, shattering it as he stomped out. This show of utter contempt for Czech culture pushed his men over the edge - they chased him down, then beat him until he blacked out and locked him up. The unit then fortified their barracks and declared their refusal “to risk our lives for a squabble between the Germans of Bohemia who hate us and the Germans of Danubia who care nothing for us.” The mutiny has spread like wildfire and now army barracks across Bohemia are in chaos. Thousands of Czech soldiers have gone on strike in solidarity with the Prague mutineers, while others have fled into the Czech heartland, taking their weapons with them. Suffice to say we will get no help from the Czechs in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAEP10.D;It was hoped that the war with the Danubians would restore the spirit of our nation and rally us out of our national crisis. The opposite has occurred. Thousands of soldiers drawn from across northern Germany, upon being informed of their deployment to the south to face the Reichsbanner’s forces, simply refused. Some cut the telegraph and phone lines into their barracks to prevent orders from being given to them, while also fortifying the entrances. Others seemed to obey but never actually arrived at the front, forcing troop trains to stop in the Elbian heartland and fleeing into the countryside. Still others outright declared their support for the Danubians organizing “Reichsbanner chapters” amongst themselves and joining forces with the pan-German nationalist rebels! Elbia, a nation without a purpose, is now a nation without much of an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This show of utter contempt for Elbian culture pushed his men over the edge - they chased him down, then beat him until he blacked out and locked him up.

Some leftist groups have joined forces with the pan-German nationalist rebels to wage a campaign of sabotage and insurrection against the government, and even the more peaceful ones have begun spreading their ideology amongst factory workers who have not yet joined the strike. While an outright revolution from within $COUNTRY$ seems unlikely - for now - the Elbian left is opposing us with a level of fury and passion never before seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We shall not.” - Elbian Premier Konrad Haldeman\n\nThe Elbian left has rallied behind our defense of the Revolution against the Danubian revisionists!

CZE1.T;The Elbian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE1.D;The shattering of the Bohemian aristocracy has led to a resurgence of Czech political power, with many government posts now held by Czechs. This has outraged the Elbian Germans in the north, who have no desire to be ruled by Slavs. Last week a rumor spread that the government would forbid German from being used within the army and mandate Czech instead. The rumor was false but over the last few days, thousands of German soldiers and officers have either resigned or outright mutinied. These rebels have linked up with German nationalist groups and given them the strength to declare secession from $COUNTRY$! Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Saxony have all severed ties with Prague, and Scandinavia has quickly recognized their independence, sparking rumors of their involvement. This has led to an explosion of Czech nationalism and attacks on German culture within $COUNTRY$ and if it was not a nation ruled by and for the Czech people before, it most definitely is now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE2.D;Our new republic requires a suitable legal foundation. Thus representatives from across the nation were summoned to Praha for a constitutional convention. After over a month of debate, we believe that the final draft is ready to be signed.

CZE3.D;Bohemia’s Altes Regime has been overthrown by a Czech revolution - one whose leaders are entirely separate from the Free Czech Legion which we were supporting. While a few hardliners within the Legion feel that the new Czech government does not reflect their values and should be overthrown as well, the vast majority of the Legion have returned to their homeland, and the organization is now effectively defunct. Thus our support of the Czech nationalist community no longer serves any purpose. Let us hope this new government will distinguish between the Bohemians who once ruled them and the Bohemian people as a whole…;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE4.T;Rumors of a Czech Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE4.D;Interior Minister Rudolf Dressler recently briefed the rest of the cabinet on the “Czech problem.” He has confirmed that there are signs of an increase in Czech nationalist and pan-Slavic activity. Circulation of nationalist propaganda has increased, and an arsenal in Budweis was recently burglarized, with signs pointing to a Czech radical group being responsible. More than one Polish merchant has been arrested in Upper Silesia for distributing Czech propaganda, so they may have more support than we know. While he confessed that these are troubling developments, he insisted that his ministry has a handle on the Czechs, and that no armed groups have yet organized. Despite his declarations, the meeting left much of the cabinet feeling uneasy about the rise of Czech nationalism in Bohemia - especially after one of the younger ministers questioned whether the Danubians might be behind this activity, a question which Dressler seemed to ignore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE5.T;Rumors of a Czech Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE5.D;Interior Minister Rudolf Dressler recently briefed the rest of the cabinet on the “Czech problem.” He has confirmed that Czech nationalists have begun organizing revolutionary cells in multiple cities. Dressler identified “Young Czechia” as the main threat, describing it as an underground group committed to establishing a Czech nation-state. This group not only spreads propaganda but is forming armed brigades, who purchase weapons abroad - mainly in Danubia - and smuggle them here, training with them in the Moravian countryside. They may also be supported by sympathetic Poles in Upper Silesia. Dressler finished by offering two plans. The first is to attempt to sow distrust between the different factions of Czech nationalists to pressure their movement to split internally. The second, more direct option would be to conduct mass arrests of known Czech nationalist leaders. Dressler warned that only the removal of the heads of the movement could truly destroy it, but many cabinet members would prefer slower and less dangerous methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE6.T;The Czech Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE6.D;Interior Minister Rudolf Dressler recently briefed the rest of the cabinet on the “Czech problem.” The mood in the room was grim - everyone had seen newspaper headlines of nationalist militias fighting in Upper Silesia. Dressler outlined the situation : Czech nationalist groups, organized under the banner of “Young Czechia,” have been stockpiling smuggled weapons and equipment - mainly from Danubia - in the Moravian countryside. Now they are making their move. At least one government arsenal in eastern Moravia has already been seized, and the rebels have encountered little resistance from non-German citizens. Furthermore Dressler believes that Poles in Upper Silesia may be either aiding the rebels or at least sympathetic to them. He concluded by declaring that martial law and a “campaign of absolute destruction” against the Czech “insurrection” would be our only hope to avert a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several Polish groups have pledged support to Young Czechia in the name of pan-Slavism. What nobody expected was the appearance of hundreds of guerilla soldiers to bolster their ranks! This “Free Czech Legion,” as it is known, seems to have been formed by Czech exiles in Danubia, and has now crossed over from Poland to aid their ethnic kin. This can only have been organized with the Danubians’ direct assistance! We must therefore assume that this Czech uprising was a Danubian plot from the start. Thankfully our authorities in Moravia were able to foil multiple Young Czechia uprisings there, leaving the movement far weaker than it might have been otherwise. But the Danubians may intervene directly…;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE10.D;The destiny of Bohemia is now in doubt. The Slavic peoples are rediscovering their strength. The winds of fortune, which once seemed to favor Bohemia even after the loss of her Imperial glory, have shifted yet again. Where does that leave us?\n\nThere are many people in our nation who do not wholly identify as Slavs or Germans. Take Adam Fierlinger, for example. A clerk in Teschen - or is it Tešín? - born to a Czech father and a German mother. Adam does not care much about religion or politics, but even he knows that the Slavs of Bohemia have long been oppressed. He owns a hunting rifle which he was gifted by his father. After hearing stories of chaos in the south, he takes the gun off its rack on the wall of his home and resolves to fight for his country. But which country is his?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the support of sympathetic members of the Polish community and the Utraquist church hierarchy, the revolutionaries have seized control of eastern Bohemia. If they are to establish a Slavic state, however, then they cannot act alone. The Free Czech Legion has become their de facto armed forces, and the Legion’s commander, newly christened General Vojtech Hácha, has agreed to act in concert with our owned armed forces.

Now an uprising by Czechs and Poles within Bohemia against the Germans has thrown this divide into sharp contrast. But it is the Danubians who have made this rebellion possible! The Bohemians have denounced the Danubians as race traitors, while the Danubians have proclaimed their aim to work with the Czechs to create a more equitable nation. Whichever side prevails will answer forever the question of Bohemia’s - or Czechia’s - identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;CZE12.A;This is OUR home, NOT yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE13.T;The Fall of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE13.D;The last holdouts of the Bohemian government were chased into Prague Castle, hastily reconditioned into a true fortress. There Danubian and Czech troops fought a bitter siege which lasted all the way into the castle’s basements and tunnels. After days of continuous fighting, the final holdouts were defeated, and the banner of the Czech nation raised over the castle which had stood for centuries as the icon of Bohemian supremacy over the Slavs. Young Czechia and the Free Czech Legion have now proclaimed the Republic of Czechia! Antonin Kalvoda, leader of Young Czechia, has been made the first president of the provisional government until elections can be held. Autonomy has been granted to multiple German provinces on the frontier but Czech culture has been cemented as the new foundation of the country. Hopefully lingering questions about the Bohemian German population will not break the Czecho-Danubian alliance apart…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE13.A;Long live Czechia, free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE14.T;The Treaty of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE14.D;Bohemia has come back from the brink to shatter both our invasion and the Czech rebellion. It seems that not even the loss of their Imperial grandeur has reduced them to helplessness. Faced with the counter-invasion of the Danubian heartland, we were forced to sign a peace treaty. Its terms required us to formally accept responsibility for fomenting an illegal Slavic insurrection in Bohemia as well as burdening us with a massive war indemnity. This defeat has dealt a catastrophic blow to our international reputation, while Bohemia’s star may be waxing one more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE14.A;We should never have gambled with Slavs…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE15.T;The Prague Spring;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE15.D;”My death will be your downfall. You can crush the flowers, but you cannot stop the spring.” - Last words of Antonin Kalvoda, leader of the Young Czechia movement\n\nThe signs of a looming Czech revolution were impossible to miss, and the police were scrambling to contain it. We thought it fortunate when, during the storming of a Young Czechia safehouse on the outskirts of Prague, we discovered the movement’s leader, Antonin Kalvoda! As the area was under martial law, he was brought to a local army base and given a swift trial. Convicted of treason, he was hanged at sundown. Unfortunately this proved to be a fatal error. News of “Kalvoda’s martyrdom” spread like wildfire and led formerly apathetic Slavic citizens to rally to Young Czechia. Soon mobs of Czech rebels stormed Prague, overwhelming the city guards. Today the banner of the Republic of Czechia flies over Prague Castle - the first to recognize the new state were the Danubians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE15.A;After centuries upon centuries, we are finally free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE16.T;The Bohemian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE16.D;The Czech people have reclaimed their nation from the Germans - but what do we do with them? The provisional constitution established considerable rights for the German people while stripping all titles from the German nobility. Yet many Czechs are clamoring to “finalize” our revolution by removing every vestige of German culture and adopting aggressive measures to “re-Czechify” the German speakers. This is considered the moderate position, as the ultranationalists have demanded the complete expulsion of all ethnic Germans from the nation and the redistribution of their lands to Czech citizens. Thus the “assimilationists” claim to be acting out of extreme generosity towards the “foreign colonists.” It is true that maintaining a federalized state with significant rights for the German population will likely prohibit us from ever truly belonging to the Slavic cultural sphere. §RBut the Germanic world, especially the Danubians, would see such oppression of the Bohemian Germans as an act of absolute evil.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE16.A;§RWe will erase for good ALL of the traces of the alien German nobility.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE16.B;Our grievances are with the German elite, not the common people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE17.T;The Prague Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE17.D;When the Czechs came to us for support, they swore to us that they sought to create an equitable nation, one that might be led by the Czech people, but where all peoples would have a voice. They lied. New laws have been passed by the Czechs to suppress the German language and German culture. Now newspapers in $CAPITAL$ bear accounts of entire communities of Bohemians driven from their villages by Slavic mobs. The cabinet has now descended into furious debate about how to address this crisis. While more cynical ministers argue that a loyal, Slavic Czechia is better than one allied to Burgundy out of fear of us, others demand vengeance. Our generals feel confident they could occupy western Bohemia, the most German region of Czechia, with little issue, but one minister has gone further. He has proposed we foment a counter-uprising amongst the Poles of Silesia, promising them generous autonomy in the Germany to come - the Czech government has, after all, given no concessions to the Poles, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE17.A;Western Bohemia will make a fitting weregild for the Czechs’ crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE17.B;We will sow chaos across their nation! §R(WILL RESULT IN WAR)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE17.C;The Bohemians were never true Germans, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE18.T;The Czech Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE18.D;When the Czechs seized control of Bohemia, we hoped that they would be able to distinguish between the German nobility who had wronged them and the German commoners who simply wanted to live within their reborn nation. We were naive. New laws have been passed by the Czechs to suppress the German language and German culture. Now newspapers in $CAPITAL$ bear accounts of entire communities of Bohemians driven from their villages by Slavic mobs. The cabinet has now descended into furious debate about how to address this crisis. While more cynical ministers argue that the Czechs could be a valuable ally against Burgundy, others demand vengeance. Our generals feel confident they could occupy western Bohemia, the most German region of Czechia, with little issue, but one minister has gone further. He has proposed we foment a counter-uprising amongst the Poles of Silesia, promising them generous autonomy in the Germany to come - the Czech government has, after all, given no concessions to the Poles, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE19.T;The Danubians Have Seized the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE19.D;The whole German world was outraged by our efforts to de-Germanize Czechia, but none so much as the Danubians. Their response was swift. Days after German refugees fleeing ethnic violence in western Czechia brought their stories of persecution to the Danubians, a Danubian army appeared in the west! There they were welcomed by German communities not yet secured by our own forces. They have not advanced any further into Czechia, but our western provinces have fallen under Danubian occupation, and the Danubians have made it clear that they will not tolerate any abuse of the Bohemians under their protection. We must now gather our strength and carefully choose the right time to strike for the liberation of our lost lands…preferably with Burgundian aid, as their ambassador has reached out to our government to offer support after news of the Danubian invasion reached Anvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE19.A;Czech unity will not be denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE20.T;Danubian Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE20.D;The whole German world was outraged by our efforts to de-Germanize Czechia, but none so much as the Danubians. Their response was swift. Days after German refugees fleeing ethnic violence in western Czechia brought their stories of persecution to the Danubians, a Danubian army appeared in the west! There they were welcomed by German communities not yet secured by our own forces. At the same time, a Polish insurrection led by the mutinying 1st Polish-Silesian Infantry Regiment under General Dalibor Gierek has seized Silesia! Gierek is almost certainly in the pay of the Danubians. We must now gather our strength and carefully choose the right time to strike for the liberation of our lost lands…preferably with Burgundian aid, as their ambassador has reached out to our government to offer support after news of the Danubian invasion reached Anvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE20.A;Czech unity will not be denied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE20.B;The “RIGHT MOMENT!?” By God, this is an act of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE21.T;A Successful Operation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE21.D;Our defense of the western Bohemians has been executed with minimal losses. Danubian forces were welcomed as liberators and protectors by the Germans of the region, and a plebiscite has already been organized to officially annex the region into $COUNTRY$. Meanwhile, our agents in Silesia were able to sway General Dalibor Gierek of the 1st Polish-Silesian Infantry Regiment to join forces with other Silesian nationalists and stage a coup against the regional government. The Poles will not forget our promise of autonomy in the future…At any rate, the Czech government has severed all diplomatic ties with our nation - while drawing closer to the Burgundians - but has otherwise declined to retaliate. Let us hope that we can one day bring liberation to the rest of Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE21.A;For our freedom and yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE22.T;A Looming Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CZE23.T;The Czecho-Danubian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE23.D;”If I knew a foreigner from anywhere in his virtue who would love God and would be interested in the good more than my own brother, he would be dearer to me than my brother. And hence I prefer good English priests over timid Czech priests and good Germans over an evil brother.” - Jan Hus\n\nDanubia once supported the Czech overthrow of Bohemia, believing that the revolutionaries would usher in a balance between Germans and Slavs. Instead the Czech government embarked on a campaign of cultural warfare against all Germans in Czechia, causing the Danubians to occupy western Bohemia to defend its German population and sponsor a Polish uprising in Silesia. Hemmed in by enemies, the Czechs were left with no choice but to declare war on both of their former allies. As cannonfire rings out across the Šumava, the Germans and Slavs once again find themselves locked in struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE23.A;We have fought for our freedom for centuries and shall continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE24.T;The Polish Silesian Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE24.D;Our integration of Silesia has run into an obstacle : the agreement made between our predecessors in the Danubian government and the Silesian Poles. The Poles are adamant that it was agreed their autonomy within a German state would be inviolate, and that they must retain complete internal self-governance. We initially attempted to dismiss this out of hand, arguing that they had no evidence for their claims beyond anecdotes - only for the Polish delegation to produce a signed agreement between the Danubian head of government and members of the Committee for Polish Rights, dating back to the overthrow of the Bohemian government. Our antiquarians insist that this document is a forgery, but foreign observers’ opinions are divided, and rejecting their petitions at this juncture would earn international condemnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE24.A;The Poles may have autonomy, but their government must suit our interests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CZE24.B;THIS IS A RIDICULOUS LIE! THROW THESE WORTHLESS RATS OUT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
### Some Sort of German Anarchy ####!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP2.T;The Reichsbanner Cracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP2.D;When Germany triumphed against Burgundy, there were those idealists who expected the Burgfrieden (castle peace) of the Great German War to continue. They were sorely mistaken. Otto Hayek and the rest of the SPD have staged a walkout from the Reichstag, protesting what they see as the growing rightist tilt of the national government. Hayek has demanded the nationalization of major industries, as well as the establishment of a broad social safety net, otherwise he promises that the SPD will refuse to sit in any future sessions of the Reichstag. Already, the far-right parties, aligned around Erich Laufen and his DNVP, are planning counter protests, and the nation is holding its breath waiting for the next move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP2.A;The Reichsbanner is broken, will Germany break with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP3.T;Erich Laufen Makes His Move;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP3.D;Enraged by the SPD’s walkout, Erich Laufen and his DNVP planned for counter protests in the capital the following week. Laufen had expected the protests to cow the left back into line. Taking to the main thoroughfares of the capital, he was disabused of that notion. Met with growing crowds of industrial workers who had dropped their tools to confront what they view as an existential threat, Laufen and his Blackshirts were chased out of the capital. This, however, was not the end of the drama. The SPD, sensing an opportunity, mobilized, ordering former members of their Bürgerarmee paramilitary to return to duty. Hayek assumed leadership of the workers in the capital and seized the entirety of the city, with the exception of government buildings which are still under the control of a weakened and tottering government backed by a notional police garrison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP3.A;The future of Germany is on the line…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP4.T; The Munich Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP4.D;Our efforts to liberate Germany have met with nothing but failure. Not only have our efforts to cross the Rhine and liberate our brothers and sisters under the Burgundian yoke been turned back, but the Burgundians have brought the war to Germany, breaking the Vaterland in twain and establishing an occupation authority in Munich. The establishment of this occupation authority is naturally seen as illegitimate by almost every German, and anger is boiling over from Bremen to Vienna at this provocation. While the Munich Regime, as the German Occupation Government has become known, is currently backed by Burgundian arms, it is immensely unstable. If the Burgundians extend their ambitions in Germany, it is possible that the whole, hated Munich Regime could come crashing down. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP4.A;Germany is broken, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP5.T;The Munich Regime Collapses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP5.D;It did not take long for the Burgundians to make clear that their ambitions in Germany extended beyond the mere humbling of the German Confederation. Anvers was ready to put to rest what it termed the “German Hydra” for good. But, like Hercules, with every head of the German Hydra cut off, two more would rise in its place. Owing either to a deliberate leak by a well placed German agent in the Burgundian Foreign Ministry, or to negligent record keeping, word has leaked that Burgundy intends to partition Germany. The news that Anvers intended to restore what some called the “Post-Wenceslian” order has inflamed public opinion across Germany. In response, Otto Hayek and the SPD rallied the workers of Munich. Almost in an instant, the Munich Regime has collapsed, and the hated Burgundian puppet regime has fled the city. Time will tell what Burgundy’s response will be, but for now, Germans dare to dream again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP5.A;Germany is not yet lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP50.T;A Peace Without Honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP50.D;The close of our titanic clash against the Burgundians brought nothing but sorrow when it was announced that the peace treaty would return all borders to their prewar status. Nothing was gained, and a generation of German men were lost, to say nothing of the devastation of our land and economy. This display of utter incompetence and weakness on the part of the German government has outraged the people, whose faith in their leadership has been shattered. Before the war, räte (councils) were starting to organize amongst the workers and soldiers of Germany, and now they are flexing their might. City after city has been paralyzed by strikes launched by workers irate at the governments’ failures, seeking not only its resignation, but its overthrow! The government has been completely unable to force these strikes to end except through use of force, often forced to use right-wing militias to break them. Every day, we surrender more and more of our political power to extremists on the left or right…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP50.A;A terrible mistake has been made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP6.T;The Salvation of Germania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP6.D;Bohemia, even as the heart of the German Confederation, had bequeathed to Germany what has become known as the “Bohemian Question.” Full of Germans and Slavs, the ethnic question had dominated the German Reichstag, and Bohemia’s role in the new confederation was still an open question when the new Great German War broke out. Now, with Germany spiraling into chaos following the War, the central government has decided to take drastic measures. In light of the unrest spreading throughout the rest of the country, the German government has made the unpopular, but some would say necessary, decision to withdraw its armed forces and garrisons from Bohemia. At a stroke, the Bohemian Question has been solved, though not in a manner anyone expected. Bohemia is again independent and free to choose her own future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP6.A;Co se lehce nabude, snadno se pozbude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP7.T;Behold a Pale Horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP7.D;Whatever efforts that the German central government took to arrest the growing chaos and anarchy in the country have not been enough. Owing either to international disappointments, gross mismanagement at home, or both, the German people have lost faith in their government. Now with the capital under the control of the communists, the central government has lost any semblance of control. In the rest of the country rival centers of power under a panoply of ideologies have begun to establish themselves. The future of Germany is unclear, but most now expect the next years to bring additional suffering to the bespotted Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP7.A;War is our homeland, our hauberk is our house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP8.T;Saxony Declares for the Volkists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP8.D;Erich Laufen’s defeat in the capital at the hands of the communists did not spell the end of his ambitions to lead Germany. Fleeing from the capital, Laufen, and what remains of his DNVP, overthrew the state government of Thuringia in Erfurt and have now ensconced themselves in the territory of the old Ernestine Duchies. Already Laufen has set to work building a prototype for his new Germany in Thuringia, purging unwanted elements, and espousing his terrifying blend of bloodthirsty pan-German ultranationalism and quasi-communist economics. Styling himself as the “Volksleiter,” Laufen has pledged to reunite Germany, though no one knows where he intends to strike next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP8.A;This will be the end of Germany as we know it. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP9.T;Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP9.D;The declaration of Laufen’s volkist state in Thuringia inevitably spelt an end for the old German government. In response, Otto Hayek, controlling the capital since the defeat of Laufen’s putsch attempt, has finally made his move to snuff out the German government, notionally still governing the country through its continued occupation of key government ministries. Hayek directed the unions in control of the capital to finally occupy government ministries and the Reichstag itself. The demoralized and dilapidated police force tasked with protecting the government gave way before the surging crowds of workers and the ranks of the Restored Bürgerarmee. Old ministers were packed off to prison if they had not already fled into exile. The Reichstag has been permanently dissolved. Otto Hayek is now Chairman of the self-styled Union of Socialist Raterepublics, although in practice his authority does not extend far beyond the capital and the old Danubian heartlands in Bavaria and Austria. Hayek’s coup has now put to bed any idea of the crisis resolving peacefully, and already local identities and alternate bases of power are reasserting themselves across Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP9.A;The old rotten Germany has collapsed, but the new Germany may yet live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP10.T;Formation of the National Protection Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP10.D;Laufen has finally made his next move. Instead of striking south and bringing the fight to his leftwing enemies as was widely expected, Laufen has instead directed his paramilitaries to advance north, hoping to occupy Brandenburg and Pommerania, thereby securing the north and the old Elbian heartlands. As it stands, Laufen has grossly overestimated his appeal and underestimated the resistance that he would face. While the volkists advanced as far as Magdeburg, further attempts to advance in Brandenburg were suddenly stopped. Spurred to action by Laufen’s sudden advance into Magdeburg, the state governments of Brandenburg and Pomerania have announced the formation of the National Protection Government with the express aim of “bringing order and stability to the Vaterland.” It is yet to be seen whether this new faction aims to unify Germany, or merely secure for itself a small patch of stability as Germany descends into chaos. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP10.A;Pomerania unifying Germany? Preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP11.T;The Nuremberg Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP11.D;As Germany descended into chaos, it appeared that no one would strive to pick up the torch of liberalism and democracy. Not so. Liberals in Nuremberg, intent on ensuring that the future of Germany is not dominated by the illiberal volkists to the north or the revolutionary communists to the south have declared a new German Republic. Convening a new Reichstag, made up in part of members of the old, this new German Republic has explicitly set itself out as the successor of the old German state, and is now intent on reunifying Germany under its own banner. Still, the task before this Nuremberg Republic is great. To its north Laufen’s government could strike at any time, and in the south Hayek’s Raterepublic is already eyeing Nuremberg with ill concealed greed. Worse yet, on the news of the Republic’s declaration, volkists in Ansbach broke away from Nuremberg, declaring their own volkist state and aligning themselves with Laufen. Time will tell if Nuremberg’s future will match its bright ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP11.A;Will the center hold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP12.T;The Braunschweig Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP12.D;As much of the rest of Germany descended into chaos and violence, the old lands of Braunschweig remained curiously quiet. As Laufen, Hayek, and the other players carved out their own fiefs, the Braunschweig state government continued to function as normal. Nevertheless, this curious state of affairs was more fragile than was let on, and when, in the early hours of the afternoon, a small anarchist demonstration began marching towards the Landtag, the whole state structure collapsed. The Braunschweig police force simply went home, and the anarchists were able to seize the reins of the state almost without a shot being fired. Almost as surprised as the citizens of Braunschweig, the anarchists have declared the establishment of the Braunschweig Commune. A new power has risen in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP12.A;No private property, no privilege, no difference in status, no usurpatory regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP13.T;Saxony Stakes Its Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP13.D;The task before Erich Laufen was great. He knew it, his unterleiters knew it, and indeed all Germany knew it. Erich Laufen’s position was also tenuous. The setbacks against the National Protection Government in Pomerania, and the emergence of a left wing state in Braunschweig have undercut his authority. Laufen needed to solidify both his state, and his hold on it. Turning to history to shore up both, Laufen has declared a new “Saxon” state, capped off by unveiling a stone statue of the Irminsul tree, sacred to old Germanic pagans, outside of his headquarters in a torchlight midnight ceremony. Harkening back to the 9th Century and the struggle against the Franks, Laufen hopes that this new identity will allow him to rally the people behind his struggle to reunify northern Germany. His paramilitaries are already mobilizing to take the fight back to the National Protection Alliance and the Braunschweig Commune. If he succeeds here, he can finally turn back to face his real rival in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP13.A;Will this new Saxony suffer the same fate as the Old?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP14.T;The German Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP14.D;”Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle (Every man for himself and God against all).” - Common phrase used to describe life in Germany during the Sixteen Years War, 1605-1621\n\nCenturies ago, there was one Germany, they say. In every age there has arisen a new regime which made pretenses of uniting the German realms, and all failed. All but one, or so it seemed. The new Germany proved just as illusory as all which preceded it, and after failing to smite the Burgundian menace, now it, too, has fallen into chaos. The central government has retreated to its core and the rest of the German lands are now but warring states. These factions may be fuelled by the brutal ideologies of modernity, but any German from centuries past would recognize the situation with a sad sense of familiarity. The collapse of Europe’s heart has thrown the continent asunder. Will the German Phoenix rise twice in one age?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP14.A;Brothers will fight and kill each other, sisters' children will defile kinship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP15.T;The Return of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP15.D;The German Anarchy has resulted in a series of bizarre occurrences, none more so than the return of the Prince of Bavaria. Showing vivre worthy of a Jeanist, the Prince, officially the second born son of the last Prince of Bavaria, smuggled himself into Augsburg, which, while ostensibly under Hayek’s control has been in a similar state of disarray as to the rest of Germany. After rendezvousing with a handful of reactionary compatriots, including the Chief of the Augsburg Landwehr, the Prince seized city hall and the old keep in the center of the city. After a brief ceremony in the city hall, the Prince was fully invested with the regalia of the prince of his city and now rules as an absolute monarch. While the Prince’s seizure of Augsburg has been much derided as a farce, Hayek’s government has been unable to restore order in the city, leaving the Prince to govern Augsburg as he sees fit. Already other provinces in old Danubia are flocking to the Prince’s banner. If not stopped soon, this could prove a mortal blow to Hayek’s power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP15.A;A new power rises?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP16.T;The Augsburg Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP16.D;While Hayek’s coup d’etat has led to the breakdown of his authority throughout northern Germany, most in the SPD thought that they would be able to rely on the loyalty of long radical Danubia. They were to be sorely mistaken. In the early hours of the morning, the Chief of the Landwehr in Augsburg executed a counter coup, seeking to seize control of the city of Augsburg and its environs as a part of a rapid march on the capital to depose Hayek’s regime and suppress the revolutionary tide before it engulfs all of Germany. While the coup succeeded in wresting Augsburg and even some farther flung territories from Hayek’s control, Hayek’s government still stands. With Hayek mobilizing his men and the new Staatspräsident of Augsburg doing the same, it appears that civil war within Danubia may be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP16.A;Blood begets blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP17.T;The Burgerkrieg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP17.D;As predicted, the government in Augsburg and the Hayek government have come to blows. Across Danubia, the forces of revolution and reaction have begun a battle to death. Brother fights brother, and family are riven apart as the war divides city, town, and village. Already atrocities are being reported against civilians, and waves of refugees are fleeing east to Hungary and south into Italy. While the fighting is still very much in the balance, whatever force emerges from this struggle will certainly be a leading player in the struggle to reunify Germany. Revolution or reaction, Danubia is still the leading light of the German struggle.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP17.A;Not for the first time, the Danube will flow red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP18.T;Triumph of Augsburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP18.D;Mass was held in the churches of Vienna as the forces of Augsburg occupied the city. Otto Hayek’s radical regime has been toppled and its chairman is nowhere to be found. Either dead or in exile, it makes no difference: Otto Hayek’s dream is dead. Vienna was spared much destruction with the city surrendering just ahead of the arrival of forces loyal to Augsburg. The rest of Danubia cannot say the same. Much of the region has been devastated by the fighting, and even now recriminations are being carried out against those who were suspected of being loyal to Hayek’s regime, or even harboring socialist sympathies. Nevertheless, whatever the cost, the forces of reaction now control Danubia, and are doubtless plotting their next move in the struggle to control Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP18.A;“We have no restrictions! God is with us.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP19.T;The Red Flag Flies over Danubia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP19.D;As expected, Hayek’s regime has triumphed. Ill organized and underequipped, Augsburg’s forces were driven from the field and back to fortified points across the country. While lengthy sieges followed in some places, especially Augsburg, which was nearly destroyed in the fighting, many of Augsburg’s forces surrendered without much of a fight. Those who sided with Augsburg’s abortive move for power are fleeing the country in droves, with those unable to leave Danubia already being rounded up and sent to work camps. Otto Hayek, in a triumphant address to the citizens of Munich, has pledged that he will not rest until all of Germany is liberated from the forces of reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP19.A;The Red Flag marches on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP20.T;Scandinavia Enters the Fray;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP20.D;Scandinavia was forced out of northern Germany decades ago, losing Pomerania and Holstein. While Scandinavia has given up on the dream of retaking Pomerania and its large German population, Copenhagen still views Holstein as an integral part of the Scandinavian Crown pilfered from it by greedy Germans. With Germany in chaos, the Scandinavians have deployed an army corps to reoccupy Holstein, reincorporating it into Scandinavia proper and evicting the German administration there. While infuriating, there is nothing that can be done to rectify the situation…for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP20.A;The Lion of the North still has teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP21.T;German Defiance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANCP21.D;We cannot fathom the minds of the Germans, for they have, against all sense, decided to take up arms against our intervention! We do not expect this campaign to be anything but swift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR2.T;Peace in the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.D;The past few years have seen the Western Pontic steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the scale of violence and destruction seen during the XVIIth and XVIIIth century in the Wild Fields between Ukraine, Russia and Tatarstan. While in the West the Zaporizhian and Dnieper hosts watch the unstable Polish-Lithuanian south-eastern borders, the Don Cossacks have recognized the Prince of Ryazan as their liege. Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids still happen it will need a change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts on the warpath. Should we unite into a single host, we might become one of the great powers of the East, and teach freedom to the oppressive magnates from the Commonwealth and the boyars from Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.A;We will see how long it lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids with the Tatars still happen it will need a drastic change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts back on the warpath : should one of the hosts be annexed, or their neighbours become too powerful they will surely unite into a single host and become a formidable force in their own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR6.T;A new situation in the Dyke Pole;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.D;The Wild Fields, this area from the Pontic Steppe fought between bands of Slavic warriors and mercenaries who call themselves the Cossacks and the Tatar khanates has seen much bloodshed in the past centuries. The Cossacks hosts fought the Tatars, Russian and Polish ambitions, and amongst themselves while attracting serfs and slaves from their neighbors lured by the freedom of the Cossack lifestyle. The Wild fields had enjoyed an era of relative peace in the past few years but this status quo has been broken as the Cossack hosts now gather their men to face a new situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.A;What will happen to these lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a renowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War, and now, with the influence of Constantinople shinking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has begun to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203510.A;Selim's plot succeeds and Murad is executed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203510.B;Selim's plot backfires and Murad becomes heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR11.T;Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR11.D;The Khan is dead, long live the Khan! Murad II, the renowned general and scholar, has succeeded in exiling his borther and taking the throne. He has promised to end obscurantism in the Khanate and to restore the rightful place of the Tatars as masters of the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203511.A;A new era for Crimea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.T;Standardization of the Tatar Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.D;Of the many reforms implemented by Murad II, the codification of the Tatar language is often seen as his most important legacy. Prior to the standardization of the Tatar language, various different dialects of the Tatar language were spoken throughout the Wild Fields, all with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Literacy remained low amongst the Tatar peoples, in part due to their migratory nature but also largely due to the difficulty of learning the Arabic script the language was traditionally written in. Under the direction of Murad II, a new script based on the Roman one was developed for the Tatar language, and spellings and grammatical conventions were codified largely from the Crimean dialect. This allowed for the written language to be significantly easier to learn for both foreigners and native speakers, and opened up Crimea to an influx of Western ideas and literature. While the new standard was not initially popular outside the lands of the Crimean Khanate, with time these conventions would come to be adopted as the Standard Tatar language, especially as a Tatar national awakening began to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203512.A;How do you read this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.T;Military Reforms of Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.D;Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the early successes of the Crimean state were Murad II’s reforms of the army of the Crimean Khanate. Having studied Western military tactics and doctrine of the last century, and having witnessed their effectiveness during the Ottoman Civil War, Murad II had become convinced of the need for military reform. While the previous hybridization of Turkish and Cossack military doctrines had fared well against the irregular forces normally encountered in the steppes by Tatar regiments, such tactics fared poorly in an open engagement between regular military forces. Thus, under Murad II, the lance was discarded in favor of the smoothbore, and a highly disciplined army unfettered by the cossack soldier’s intimidation or provocation was formed. While initially unpopular, Murad II’s military reforms ensured the long-term survival of the Crimean state in the face of encroaching Cossack and Russian expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203513.A;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.T;The Unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.D;Both the Russian principalities and the Cossack hosts have been hungrily eyeing Tatar lands for decades now, and both have been growing in power in recent years. For the Tatars to remain free from foreign subjugation, they must be united into a single nation powerful enough to resist foreign incursions. As the only Tatar polity to even resemble a modern state, the mantle falls upon us to unite our brethren under our benevolent rule and to drive the Russians and Cossacks out of Tatarstan. Our first step lies in the conquest of our neighbors to the north, the Astrakhan Khanate. While none of the Tatar khanates remain unscathed from the times of the Departure, the Astrakhan Khanate was the one most devastated by the conquests of the Cossack hordes. Despite decades having passed, the Astrakhan Khanate has yet to recover, only staving off foreign conquest due to the relative worthlessness of their lands to the Russians and the constantly shifting political situation amongst the principalities. Before the political tides change in Russia, we must conquer them and utilize what resources they do have to strengthen our own position in the Wild Lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.A;The Astrakhan Khanate is weak. We must seize the advantage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.B;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.T;Conquest of Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.D;The Khanate of Kazan has been in slow decline for decades, and has only recently begun to recover from the Chayka Rebellion. With the Khan of Kazan increasingly relying on foreign support to maintain his rule, Kazan teeters on the edge of becoming little more than a Ryazanian client state. Before the Ryazanians can make their move, we must invade the Khanate of Kazan, and with our armies now experienced in the use of new tactics and weaponry after our conquest of Astrakhan we will no doubt make quick work of any forces Kazan may throw at us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.A;Surely our armies will not stop with just Astrakhan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.B;Perhaps it would be wise not to be too ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.T;Djihad for Saraj the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.D;Saraj the Great. Located in the approximate geographical center of Tatar culture, this city represents much to the myriad peoples of the Steppes. Prior to its conquest by the Akhtuba Host, the city was the main source of wealth and power for the Astrakhan Khanate, controlling portage between the Don and Volga Rivers, and was even briefly the capital of the khanate after the Dzungar sack of Astrakhan. With the loss of the city to the peasant armies of Zarubin Chayka, the Astrakhan Khanate was left in shambles, and the whole Tatar nation was shaken by the loss of that magnificent city to the Cossack heathens. With our recent unification of the Tatar nation, prominent imams all across Tatar lands have called for a Djihad for the reconquest of Saraj the Great. We now stand at a crossroad; on one hand, such a move would surely unite the diverse peoples of our newfound Tatar state under a single banner, and would obtain for us a worthy city for the capital of our new nation. On the other hand, the fall of the Akhtuba Host would certainly rouse the other formerly neutral Cossack hosts into action against us, potentially creating an enemy we are not prepared to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.A;Onwards to Saraj the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.B;We must not provoke the Hosts into uniting against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.T;The Fall of the Akhtuba Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.D;Truly, Allah is on our side! The heathens of the Akhtuba Host have fallen before our invincible armies, and much of the remaining Cossack interlopers have been driven out or killed. Saraj the Great now lies in our hands, never again to fall to the infidel. So claim the devout amongst us, anyway. Already, however, Cossack riders have been spotted broaching our borders, and cross-border raids from the remaining hosts have nearly ceased altogether. The more cautious warn that this is the calm before the storm, and that cossack forces are preparing for a massive war the likes of which has not been seen since the end of the cossack Departure. Whatever the case may be, should the remaining cossack hosts decide to mobilize against us, they will not find us unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.A;Let their armies break before us like waves crashing on a rocky shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.T;The People of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.D;While nominally a nation united by Islam and opposition to Russian expansion, there exist great disparities between the various different peoples that constitute the Tatar nation. The Tatars of Crimea have long been within the Ottoman cultural sphere, while the Tatars of Kazan have grown to share certain commonalities with their Russian neighbors to the north. In addition to this, recent overtures in Crimea to opening up to the West have led to an influx of ideas regarding secularization and the rights of man throughout the lands of the former khanate, meanwhile large parts of the Tatar population outside of Crimea have grown to resent this trend of increasing liberalism in Crimea. These two factions will almost certainly create much friction as the new Tatar nation struggles to define what it exactly means to be a “Tatar.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.A;To be a Tatar is to live free from foreign yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.T;Troubles brewing in Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.D;Unlike its northern neighbours, the Princedom of Ryazan holds little esteem for the title of Prince and has embraced the tradition of elective monarchy of its most powerful neighbour, albeit sugar-coating it with token remembrances of ancient Slavic customs. The Ryazanian Duma has always picked a Repnin since the union of the princess Anastasia with Nicholas Repnin, but the possibility of declaring loyalty to a charismatic unifier, like during the time of the Troubles, remains a very possible outcome. The real power in Ryazan thus lies not in the hands of the Prince but in the hands of the nobility leaders assembled in the Duma. Currently, Michael II Repnin rules in Ryazan and his fondness of military affairs (that gave him the nickname of 'Prince-in-the-barracks') has led many boyars to believe that he is not very interested in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.A;It will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.T;The coup of Michael II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.D;Despite appearances, Michael II, the so-called 'Prince-in-the-barracks' had been creating an ever-growing network of collaborators, especially among the Cossacks from the Don Host. His contempt for serfdom and boyar excesses has become more and more evident over the past few months and he finally decided to make his opinion known by assembling the Duma in his palace of Ryazan. Cossacks then surrounded the chamber where Michael II had called the nobles, while he attempted to proclaim the dissolution of the assembly and his reign as autocrat of Ryazan. The boyars were taken by surprise at first, but soon fighting erupted as the nobles launched their own retinues against the Cossack guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.A;The Coup is successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.B;Boyars take control of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.D;Michael II had succeeded in his coup. He is now autocrat of Ryazan with all power over the state, a feat that no Prince of Ryazan has managed since the times of Alexander II Repnin 'the Gunpowder Prince.' The Boyars' have been crushed, many lying dead and the few remaining either rallied to him or are in shackles. One of the first actions he took was the release of the Don Host from their allegiance. Cossacks had helped him access true power, and he thus had to pay his debt to them. However the alliance between the ataman Beketov and the prince endured, and Michael II still retained many Cossack advisors in his court and own army. Among them was the notorious commander of the guard, soon promoted to general of the Prince's armies, Yemelyan Razin, who was soon to be recognized as one of the finest commanders of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.A;Until another day, Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.T;Victory of the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.D;The fight begun by Michael II ended poorly for the Prince. As the Boyars fought for their lives, the Prince himself was killed in the fray of battle, with his Cossack guards either meeting the same fate or surrendering. The Boyars soon crowned the nephew of Michael II, Pyotr Repnin as his successor. A weak boy aged 13, he would be no danger to the power of the Duma. The various nobles now had to take a stance towards the Don Host. The ataman Pyotr Beketov has already announced that he was loyal to the Prince and did not recognize the new prince, hosting the son of Michael II, Alexander, in their territory as the legitimate heir. We could let these peasants go as they have been a thorn in our side for decades or move to directly annex them, although that may stir the other Cossacks against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.A;Let the Host go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.B;We will take back our lands from this 'host'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.T;The Cossack threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.D;As we feared the Cossacks have united following our takeover of the Don host. While it may seem unimportant, these Cossacks claim the lands we have taken and thus could strike against us when the fight with the other principalities begin. It is thus of the utmost importance that we strike first and place various loyal atamans to rule the steppe in our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR25.A;Down with the Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.T;Victory over the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.D;The feared Cossack bands were no matched for the armies of Ryazan who crushed their resistance and forced them to come to terms. The general Rada would be abolished, with the various hosts created again with loyal atamans placed at their helm. Now the South waits for Ryazan and soon Russian orders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.A;A mighty victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.T;Defeat in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.D;Our ambitions were too grandoise, and our armies could not defeat the bands of hastily prepared peasants of the South. We have lost our opportunity to create a strong state in the South and may never gain such an opportunity again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.A;A sad day for Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.T;Renew the Departure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.D;The Akhtuba host was founded as the last free Cossack host, on the ruins of the Chayka rebellion and the Turgut attack on the Astrakhani. We have spent decades defeating the various Tatar rebellions and raiders in our territory but it is not enough. As the princes of the North and even the Tatars themselves change, we must also renew our conquests of the Wild Lands and end the Astrakhani khanate once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.A;Let us end the Mohamedan !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.B;We can’t do that…;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.T;The Ukrainian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.D;Ukraine has been formed in the West by the various Cossack hosts as a means of protecting our way of life from invaders. We were not included in the original deal because of our power and also fierce independence, but as years go on and we see the stability brought by this new state, it seems to many that it would be in our interest to join our brothers under one Host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.A;Ukraine is the path forward !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.B;Our independence can’t be negotiated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR30.T;The Akhtuba Cossacks join us !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.D;The Akhtuba host that didn’t join our state after the general Rada has approached us seeking to join our glorious federation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.A;Long live Ukraine !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR31.T; Stepan Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.D;As the Cossack hosts finally threw out the Polish officials and declared independence, the Dnieper host elected Stepan Sternenko as their new Hetman. A renowned mercenary who was forbidden by Warsaw to come back to his homeland because of his experience in the German Wars and also the Hungarian Independence War, he is widely seen as one of the Cossack national heroes. But his friends and allies know that his ambitions are wild and he sees himself as the successor of the Blue Hetman, Semen Bilozersky that had unified the people of Ukraine against the Commonwealth. And he is ready to destroy anyone who might try to hinder his work.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.A;Who does he think he is ?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.T;Sternenko’s move;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.D;As the Rada convened in Kharkov, Hetman Sternenko began his speech by referring to the Blue Hetman uprising of the XVIIth century. Since his defeat, Cossacks in Western Ukraine had lived under the Polish boot and the various hosts were used as pawns for foreign designs. With their new independence, the Dnieper Cossacks were designated by God to unify the Wild Lands, by force if need be, and for this to happen, Sternenko demanded full war-powers and the end of the Rada convenings until unification. As the votes are cast …;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.A;Sternenko secures power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR32.B;Sternenko loses power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR33.T;Reunification of the Western Host;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.D;The Western Cossacks had been united in a single host before the Polish forcefully separated the lands between the Dnieper and Zaporizhian hosts. Now is the time to end the pesky southern host and unify Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.A;For Cossack unity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.T;Securing the Donets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR34.D;The Donets basin was settled by independent Cossacks in the Departure Era, and has many times been threatened by the heathen Crimean sultanate. We have the duty to protect them from the Muslims and secure these vital black lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.A;For Cossack victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.T;Ending the Northern lapdogs;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.D;The Don Cossacks pledged themselves to the Princedom of Ryazan long ago and their new independence still is plagued by the influence of their boyars. We must strike against them to secure a strong and pure Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.A;For Cossack purity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.T;Failure of Sternenko;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.D;The ambitions of the Hetman were ended as he suffered defeat in his unification wars. His opponents profited from this to convene a new Rada and end his Hetmanate, leaving him to flee for his life abroad. Now the Ukrainian plains return to peace and their old ways of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.A;Defeat means peace at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR37.T;Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.D;At last, Ukraine has been united under the protection of Sternenko and his valorous soldiers. But now is the time for ruling. Already over the course of his campaigns, Sternenko made several laws modernizing the Host and turning into a real state like the rest of the West. Lingering Cossack influences have already hindered his efforts, but it seems that Ukraine’s future as a united polity is secure. But many wonder what this state will be : Sternenko has harboured some ambitions for his office to become hereditary and thus make Ukraine a monarchy, but he has fought along many Republicans in his life and could give powers to a renewed Chorna Rada.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.A;A Cossack Republic is what we need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.B;The Hetman shall lead as our monarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.C;Nothing really needs to change;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR38.T;The Kazan threat;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.D;After taking back power from the hands of the Duma, Michael II set his eyes on his neighbor : the Khanate of Kazan. The Khanate has been declining for decades, and held only because of the help we provided in putting down the Chayka rebellion that saw slaves rebel all along the Volga and threatened to spill into the serfs of Ryazan. Now Michael II wants to erase this shameful past and secure his rule and glory by pushing the Khanate to the Volga. An extensive campaign of conquest cannot be undertaken with the threat of the other princedoms but the Ryazanian court thought that reducing Tartar territory could only be helpful in the troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.A;To the Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR38.B;We cannot risk it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR39.T;Volga-Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.D;Ryazan has begun to avenge its past of humiliations at the hands of the steppe demons. Ryazanian armies swept the hordes of Kazan to the other side of the Volga and lands are already put to culture while our boats roam the Volga. Michael II returned to Ryazan hailed by the population and it seems to many of his neighbors that Ryazan will be a tough opponent in any fight to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.A;All hail Michael !;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR40.T;Setback in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.D;The plans of the Prince did not guarantee victory. It seems the Tatars are far from being uncivilized savages as many assumed, and our soldiers learnt it as they were forced back to our lands. Many wonder how Michael II could recover from such a blow to his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.A;How could it happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.T;An unstable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.D;Uniting our people under one banner was easy, but making them accept that Ukraine needs to endure as a modern state for the Cossack spirit not to die has been harder. Many want to continue the lives of their forefathers as free men in the Dyke Pole with no state to watch them. The next Rada will be decisive for the future of Ukraine and its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Let us go back to the Hosts of yore !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Ukraine will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.T;The visit of John Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.D;A strange man has appeared in Kharkov the other day. Claiming to be the son of a rich industrialist from Scotland, John Carnegie has apparently embarked on a trip throughout Eastern Europe to see the fierce and independent spirit of the Eastern Slavs in the open steppe. A romantic at heart, he has spent days with various Cossack hosts inspecting our borders and our lands, always astonished by our ways of life and the wilderness of our lands. He has proposed a partnership with the industrial conglomerate of his father to help $THIS$ develop although it will surely take years to be realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.A;A most peculiar visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.T;The creation of Karnegove;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.D;Following his last visit, John Carnegie has lobbied several bankers and fellow industrials to support his endeavors in our lands. Securing a large capital, he came back to Ukraine with the goal of building a metalwork factory in the Donbass where the abundance of coal is notorious. Our council of state has made him an honorary citizen of Ukraine and the town that sprung up around him was soon called 'Karnegove'. There, the finest steel of the East is produced and fuels a nascent industrialization of our nation. Carnegie has organized the factory on a 'socialist' model with schools and housing for his employees, hoping to create a perfect society in the middle of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.A;Steel makes us stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.T;The Donbass boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.D;The whole Donets basin is filled with coal and iron making it a natural area for industrialization to launch. Following the establishment of Karnegove several of the Cossack leaders have assembled in companies to exploit the riches of the Donbass, as foreign banks heavily invested in what many deem the 'best investment' there is right now in Europe. Many Cossacks have thus abandoned their small farms for the halls of the factories and the coal pits, ensuring the wealth of Ukraine and a rising standard of living throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.A;Let us all profit from this boom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.T;The lamentations of Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.D;Few news have reached us from the manor of Karnegove where the founder of the city has secluded himself for months. A mystical man at heart, he blames himself for the transformations of Ukraine and its people. His last speech to his employees  was written down by a journalist : 'Black smoke rises from the Ukrainian factories as it does in Scotland. Countless children are sacrificed in the pits or the factories where they once benefited from a humble but pure life in the Wild Fields...' He went on and on for nearly an hour before collapsing. The transformation is real, but at least his model factory continues to be a beacon of hope for many workers of the Donbass who crave the same housing and education provided in Karnegove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.A;A strange end for the Steelman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.T;Opening of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.D;"Rada" usually referred to an assembly of Cossack commanders, which were convened by the hetmans to resolve disputed issues. This time, however, the Rada looks quite different. At the Rada, which determines the structure and life of the unified Cossack state, absolutely everyone is allowed in, even ordinary soldiers, and they are given the same right to vote as the most influential commanders. Such an approach has increased the legitimacy of Ukraine and its Hetman, who is now respected by all parts of the Cossacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR46.A;Our fate is in our own hands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.T;Question of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.D;Despite the fact that Ukraine is considered a free land, in some Cossack hosts there is a wide layer of debt slaves and landless peasants who "voluntarily" work for the landowners. A large number of common Cossacks support the abolition of this system and the establishment of fair pay for all throughout Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.A;Serfdom in Ukraine? No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.B;We can't just abolish our customs...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.T;Question of State;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.D;The problem of host autonomy is perhaps the most pressing issue at this Rada. Despite the fact that the lands of Ukraine have been conquered by its unifier, local elites still count on some degree of autonomy. Will Ukraine be a centralized state, or a confederation of different regions, troops, and cities?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.A;The modern state have to be centralized!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.B;Confederation? Where have I heard that word before...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.T;Question of Military;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.D;At this point, our military forces are more like large bands than a regular army. Despite their combat effectiveness, Cossack military tactics are not formalized, and the creation of Western-style officer academies has not been successful. Few understand the need for modernization, and it is unclear whether their arguments will convince their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.A;United army for a united nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.B;No need to rush...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.T;Question of Voting rights;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.D;The Cossacks have a long tradition of collective decision-making. Often, even officers were elected from among the most respected soldiers, even if they were not the most competent tacticians and strategists... Obviously, the government in Ukraine will be elective, but the question is, who will elect it? It is clear to every Cossack that only the one holding a weapon in his hand has the right to choose, but the few liberals among the Cossack elite propose to give the right to vote to every man in Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.A;A voting citizen is a happy citizen.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.B;The right to vote has to be earned;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.T;Question of Hetman;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.D;The question of hetman rule had long been on the agenda. Not everyone likes the fact that a man once elected can count on power for the rest of his life, even if he no longer deserves it. A proposal was made to elect a hetman every few years, so that it would be clear that we are ruled by the most worthy one at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.A;Cossack Monarchy is our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.B;Long live the Cossack Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.T;Success of the Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.D;Despite the squabbles and arguments, those present at the Rada were still able to come to an agreement. The written Constitution of Ukraine will become the basis of our state and a symbol of unity of the Cossack people, which happened for the first time in 200 years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.T;Failure of the Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.D;Despite our seeming success in unifying Ukraine, we were unable to impose our will on the rest of the hosts. The draft Constitution of Ukraine, proposed by the Hetman, was a dismal failure, destroying his authority in the eyes of even his closest supporters. Various influential figures are already declaring themselves hetmans and restoring their independence, and it is up to us whether this process will be peaceful or whether we will once again show our strength and bring our enemies to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.A;A dream of Ukraine is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.B;To arms, khloptsi!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.T;Collapse of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.D;The situation at the Rada has heated up to the limit. Grouped into small parties, the Cossack elite and its subordinates cannot agree on a single issue. The word of the Hetman decides nothing, and no one listens to his opinion anymore. The elite accuses him of letting the "mob" into the Rada, while ordinary Cossacks blame him for compromises and his inability to demonstrate his leadership, for which he was loved by the soldiers. Delegations leave the Rada, and it has become clear to everyone that it is impossible to unite Ukraine by force of words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.T;Victory over separatists;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.D;Despite the fact that the starting situation in this civil war seemed deplorable, we were able to subdue all the rebellious areas and establish our authority there. Now that we have no serious political opponents left, we can implement our vision for the future of Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR56.T;Ruina;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.D;The war has exhausted the resources of all sides. We could not defeat the separatists, which means that dreams of a united Ukraine have been postponed for several more decades, if not forever. Weakened and divided, the land of the Cossacks is now open to conquest from all sides...;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.A;What have we done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR57.T;The Threat of Russian Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR57.D;We have heard ill tidings from the North. The Russian states, once seemingly trapped in a circuitous and endless conflict between themselves, have escaped this cycle and united their people. Their bellicose attitude and long-standing contempt for our people makes conflict between our nations inevitable. Fortunately we have obtained sufficient recognition from the Great Powers to be able to publicly repudiate Russia’s immediate territorial ambitions against us. Our sovereign has made a grand speech in which he denounced the Russian menace and declared the “indisputable independence of the Tatar people,” a proclamation which has helped to cast doubt on the international community’s recognition of Russian territorial claims against us. But this is only a temporary respite : §Russia is coming, and when she arrives, she will ignite a war for our survival.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR57.A;We must prepare ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.T;Our Old Nemesis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.D;Our position as the protector of all Russian people is under threat. There is no event in Slavic history more recurrent than that of Asiatic hordes coming west and stamping the native people down. Russians in particular have been butchered, expelled, and even enslaved by the old hordes of the past. The current Tatar state is the heir to these savages and its existence precludes the possibility of Russia becoming a mighty nation. So as long as the Tatars remain united and strong, we will never be truly safe from continued attacks upon our people, nor shall we be able to tame the vast lands of the east. The only answer that our generals, advisors, and people will accept is the utter destruction of the Tatar state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.A;We will avenge the Russians that came before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.T;The Russians Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.D;Our gravest fears have been confirmed. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared war upon us, in what can only be an attempt at the outright destruction of our state and the subsequent enslavement of the Tatar people. While some ministers had argued that we should seek military aid from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the treacherous Poles have cut off all communication with our realm, abandoning us to face the Russian Bear alone. Now all of the Tatar people must ready themselves for the titanic clash which shall decide the fate of all Tatars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.A;We shall be the death of Russia!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.T;A Standstill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.D;We have been humbled. Our blessed armies, praised as invincible, were mortal after all. The Tatar hordes may have failed to destroy us, but we too have failed to destroy them. Every fight has ended without either side able to complete their victory over the other, and towns and villages have been sacked on both sides of the border. With victory nowhere in sight, we have been forced to sign a white peace with their government. The people are shocked at these events and we will be recovering for some time from the repercussions of this military failure. The Tatar question will remain unsolved…for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.A;We will be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR61.T;The End of the Tatar Horde;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR61.D;The glory of this day shall never be forgotten by the Russian people! The outdated and ill-led Tatar military was easily overwhelmed and routed on the battlefield. Their Khan was even killed in the ensuing rout, with some of our Cossacks riding him down. Leaderless and without hope, their nation has completely disintegrated, with various Tatar chiefs (and opportunistic Cossacks) carving out their own fiefs from the corpse of their once-united realm. We have annexed the left bank of the Volga during the chaos, and in due time the remaining Tatar states shall all be destroyed. With this stunning victory it seems that we will have no other obstacles to our expansion further south towards the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR61.A;Forward march! For Mother Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR62.T;The Treaty of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR62.D;Glorious victory! Our righteous armies, steeled with courage and hope, have driven the invaders back with fire and sword. International observers thought it impossible for “mere Asiatic savages” to overcome the numerous and well-equipped Russian army, but they were proven wrong today! A treaty was signed in $CAPITAL$ which has awarded all of the western steppe to $COUNTRY$ and publicly annulled any of Russia’s territorial claims either to our homeland or to our newly acquired territories. It is possible that Russia will one day seek revenge, but for now, let us rejoice! With this victory, the Khan has ordered three days of celebration to take place, in honor of the victory and those that died to achieve it. Long live the Tatar people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR62.A;Three days? How about six!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR63.T;Invaders Beaten Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR63.D;Glorious victory. Our horses, steeled with courage and hope, have with fire and sword drove the invaders back. It was thought unlikely or even impossible by outside observers for our state to successfully route the numerous and well-equipped Russian army, but they were proven wrong today! With this victory, the Khan has ordered three days of celebration to take place, in honor of the victory and those that died to achieve it. Long live the Tatar people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR63.A;Three days? How about six!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR64.T;Collapse of the Tatar Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR64.D;Without specific critical cities that fundementally hold $COUNTRY$ together as a singular nation state, $COUNTRY$ has rapidly dissolved back into bickering Tatar warlords. All hope is lost for what was once a glorious last stand for the Tatar people against the Russians and Polish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR64.A;We shall return to the Steppe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
##################### Malta Stuff (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MLT1.T;An old and sick Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.D;The Order of Saint John has settled in Malta back in 1573, liberating the land from the Ottoman corsairs that had settled there. Our legacy endures but right now the current Grandmaster, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval would take advantage of this state to call a new election. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, Pons De Margarit de Biure, Montfort-Laval and his supporters will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean, although the Plantagenet king is already the official patron of the order. For the moment, the island is calm but who knows for how long ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.A;Trouble is brewing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.T;The Grandmaster of Malta ill;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.D;News have reached the European court that the current Grandmaster of the order of Saint John, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval has expressed that he wanted to take advantage of this state to call a new election, considering Cheschi unfit to maintain his power. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, he will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.A;How will it play ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.T;Death of the Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MLT4.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose our loyal supporter, Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.A;A most auspicious news !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose the Aragonese Pons de Margarit de Biure, to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century. Jean de Montfort-Laval's influence has plummeted over the years and the man could do nothing against this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.A;A failed opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.T;Change in Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.D;The crown of Aragon has been the feudal overlord of the Order because the island belonged to the crown of Sicily before the Alfonsine concession of 1579. But now Aragon has lost the island and many wonder what it entails for Malta. Several groups have agitated in the previous days : the Knights are commonly hated by the population and many wish to throw them out the island for good. Among these factions many Irrendentists wish the island to join with their Italian brothers in Sicily. But in the end the Knights still possess the artillery and weapons and could try to crush this uprising. Who shall dictate the path of Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.A;The independent Republic of Malta!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.B;Malta must embrace the Italian cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.C;Knights hold out and declare sovereignity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.T;A Republic in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.D;Following our loss of the Sicilian island the Knights of Malta were ousted from the island by a popular uprising who declared an independant Republic, breaking all ties they had with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.A;An independant Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.T;An envoy from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.D;Following our victory over the Aragonese Crown, the citizens of Malta ended the rule of the Knights over them and have now declared their intention to join our state !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.A;Viva $COUNTRY$ !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.T;Malta joins Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.D;Following our defeat in Sicily, the Maltese crowds soon ousted the Knights and declared their intention to join those who now occupy the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.A;The nail in the coffin...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.T;Independence of the Order;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.D;With our loss of the island of Sicily, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John has proclaimed that he did not have to honour the old contract that binded the order with our Crown and proclaimed the independence of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.A;But ... the Alfonsine concession ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.T;The Maltese uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.D;The hold on the Knights grew weaker over the years as the newfound independence gave several ideas to the Maltese intellectuals who already hated the Knights when they were just 'Aragonese lapdogs'. Following several economic crises and scandals involving Knights and especially the head of the English tongue, the Nationalists decided to organize a demonstration in the capital of Porto Ferrante. From there Ugo Buhagiar, leader of the Nationalists tried to lead his supporters to take the Palace of the Grandmaster and proclaim the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.A;The Grandmaster is toppled : long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.B;The crowd is dispersed by the Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.T;A meeting in Marseilles;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.D;Jean de Montfort-Laval was never meant to become a Knight. The first heir of one of the greatest noble families of the Kingdom, he had to flee and become a Knight following a duel provoked by a remark of the poet Maurice de la Rochefoucauld over his sister. Arriving in Malta at the age of 21 he soon used his prestige and charisma to climb the levels of the order and become the second most powerful man in Malta. With our conquest of the Valois duchy, he has come on an embassy to negotiate officially the status of the Provence tongue possessions in our Kingdom. But in private he has asked for the support of the Rex Christianissimus, should the Grandmaster step down, and promised us to become our foremost ally in the Mediteranean. His ambitions may be high, but Malta could be used as a friendly base on the road to the Levant and would foremost lower the power of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.A;The Pact of Marseilles is signed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.T;The Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT13.D;For years, the young head of the Auvergne tongue, Jean de Montfort-Laval has criticized the current Grandmaster for holding on to power while his life resumes to lying in bed or visiting sanatoriums. The pressure has been high for Pietro Cheschi who finally decided to abdicate following the latest attacks in the Holy Council. A new election is to be called to select the 75th Grandmaster and it will surely be a contentious one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.A;Let us thanks Pietro Cheschi for his service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.T;Abdication of Pietro Cheschi;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT14.D;The Grandmaster of the order of Malta has abdicated because of his bad health. At least that's the official version : the head of the Aragonese tongue has contacted us to inform us of the latest maneuvers of the Dual-Monarchy, patron of the Order since the XVIIth century and which currently supports the young Jean de Montfort-Laval. Our ambassadors fear that they may try to place their puppet to increase their influence and make the island their possession and not ours. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.A;The election is a game we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.T;A contentious election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT15.D;The election of the 75th Grandmaster is contentious. Montfort-Laval hoped to win the election without any problems, but his influence is as high as the hatred and contempt he inspires many of his brothers. The head of the German tongue, Karl Von Preysling, has even retired to the German inn in the port, refusing to take part in the process because of the irregularities he has witnessed. For now the election is thus blocked...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.A;Such infighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.T;News from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT16.D;As the prime Catholic nation of Europe, we have an interest in the direction of the Order of Saint John in Malta, with most of the German knights hailing from our country or our allies. The Apostolic legate in Prague has contacted us because the head of the German tongue (administrative division of the order) in Malta, Karl von Preysling is blocking the election process of the Grandmaster because of his personal hatred of the main candidate Jean de Montfort-Laval. We exert a lot of influence amongst the German brothers and could force Von Preysling to come back to the table of negotiations. The Pope has informed us that the rivalry between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy is a great concern : we could push Von Preysling to make a bid to become Grandmaster and establish a new relation of the Order with his patrons, or we could just instruct him to end the election as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.A;The Kaiser wants Von Preysling to become Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.B;The Kaiser just wants the end of this political drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interference;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT17.D;The election is not as smooth as Monfort promised us. He has been challenged because of his youth and of several rivalries he made since his arrivals. Among these, the offended Karl von Preysling has recently come back to the Holy Council for the election, proposing himself as a neutral and peaceful choice for Grandmaster. We had heard of the interest of the Prague court in these matters but we did not envision they would use their influence for such a thing. Several Italian knights have joined Von Preysling because of Papal manipulations and we are now forced to demand Spain to put pressure on their knights in the Portuguese and Castilian tongues to ensure that our investment in Montfort-Laval succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.A;Contact the Spanish ambassador, they will feel important for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.T;A demand from Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT18.D;The Order of Saint John has convened for a new election following the retirement of the previous Grandmaster. Our influence there is not so strong with the Spanish knights representing a fringe minority in the ranks of the Order but as the election grows more decisive the Anglois choice of Jean de Montfort-Laval faces increased competition. The head of the Spanish knights, Pedro de Olivares has yet to pronounce his judgement and our friends in Paris have asked us for our support. Supporting them is the best course of action since it will surely weaken Aragon while enhancing our position in European diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.A;Contact Olivares, he has a favour to honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.T;Ending the stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT19.D;Factionalism has grown over the previous weeks as European diplomats sent various messages to Malta to instruct the Knights from the wishes of the sovereigns of their homelands. 3 candidates are still in the competition : Jean de Montfort-Laval's ambitions are still strong and he hopes to end the current situation of the Order with Aragon thanks to the protection of Paris counting on the support of most of the Anglois and Spanish knights. On the other hand Pons Margarit de Biure proclaims that he is a traitor and can count on the votes of the Aragonese knights. Meanwhile Karl von Preysling has come back, promoting himself as a compromise candidate, who with the backing of the Papacy and the Emperor in Prague wishes to affirm neutrality from both Aragon and Dual-Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.A;Karl von Preysling becomes the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.B;Monfort-Laval wins despite all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.C;Margarit de Biure confirms the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.T;A new situation in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT20.D;Our candidate in the election has lost but at least the Anglois Montfort did as well! The new German knight has the support of Prague and also Rome, as the Holy Father has been angered by the various intrigues that plagued the succession of Pietro Cheschi. The Apostolic legate has thus drafted a plan that would see our feudal contract ended with the Order while making sure that the archipelago would not be used by a foreign power against us, notably the Dual-Monarchy. With the intervention of the Pope it seems hard to go against this situation and Malta isn't really worth the hassle after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.B;We don't accept the Convention!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.T;The Convention of Porto Ferrante;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT21.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, he asked the Aragonese King to change the feudal contract that binded the Order to the King of Sicily by assuming neutrality in the Mediteranean. Following the vicious infighting that the election caused, this solution was supported by the Curia who had sent the first draft to Barcelona about this new situation. Malta would be ceded to the Order in full, with the Knights promising to observe neutrality outside of their protection duties. The Convention was then signed in Porto Ferrante by both representatives from the Anglois and Aragonese Kings, leading to the end of their relationships with the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.A;The Knights protect the island and nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.T;The Maltese Falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT22.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling received a letter of thanks for his support along with a magnificent Maltese Falcon. The bird had been the symbol of the feudal relationship between the Order and Barcelona and Karl von Preysling had decided that it was only fitting that his Imperial Majesty received the last of these gifts. The animal would be given to Princess Elisabeth, the first born of the Emperor who would begin a tradition of hunting with only Maltese falcons. Along with her other eccentricities, the bird would become a symbol, many of the Bohemian Imperial family members being painted or later taking photos of them with these Falcons, often nicknamed the 'Imperial Falcon'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.A;The Bohemian Eagle deserves such a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.T;Election of Montfort-Laval;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT23.D;What we feared happen, the Anglois protégé and ambitious knight, Jean de Montfort-Laval was elected by the Holy Council to lead the Order. For now he has publicly sent us our Maltese Falcon as a sign of his submission to the current agreements between the Order and our sovereign but behind closed doors, it is no secret that he dreams of an independent Malta, with him girdling a Crown...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.A;We will have to watch him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.T;An ally in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT24.D;Our ally, Jean de Montfort-Laval has won the election in Malta. In a secret letter to our goverment he has assured us that he will move quite soon against the current status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.A;New opportunites arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.T;The Grand-principality of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT25.D;The Order of Saint-John has been criticzed for decades about his general lack of utility in the modern world. With piracy in the Mediteranean ended, they have been left without a cause and hated by the general population of the archipelago because of the heavy taxation. The latest Grandmaster, Jean de Montfort-Laval took advantage of this situation to coup the Holy Council, the administrative head of the Order by declaring himself Grand-Prince of Malta, and nationalising the Order, while allowing the Knights who swore fealty to him to remain. He then promulgated a charter to associate the Maltese elites, making him vastly popular on the islands. Now, even with the Anglois protection he must face the Aragonese who are still the de jure masters of the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.A;Long live our Prince !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.T;A prince in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT26.D;The proclamation of the Grandmaster as Prince of Malta and the nationalisation of the order surprised many despite the knowledge that he was up to some scheme. But now we are faced with a dilemma : either we recognize the actions of 'John I' of Malta and his independence or we will have to fight the Dual-Monarchy who has already recognized the new monarch of the islands. Is Malta really worth a war with the greatest power of Europe ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.A;Recognize his independence, he only rules three worthless rocks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.B;The archipelago is a possession of the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.T;Safe from Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT27.D;The gamble from the Prince had worked : Aragon forfeited its claims over our archipelago, fearful of the protection from our friends in Paris. It is a new era for Malta, which is now independent. To celebrate this, John I decided to sail back to his homeland to thank the Anglois court for their support (and secure a wedding prospect now that he had been liberated from his vows), and upholding his promise of being a trusted ally in the Mediteranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.A;All is calm in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.T;The election of Pons Margarit de Biure;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.D;Pons Margarit de Biure, head of the Aragonese tongue of the Knights of Saint John has been elected Grandmaster of the Order. This news was met with joy in Barcelona given that he was the candidate of the King and the only one who supported the current relationship Malta has with the Crown. He also has opposed the Anglois interests in the islands, denouncing in particular Jean de Montfort-Laval who was accused of treason and thrown into prison following the discovery of several letters indicating his plots against the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.A;Long live the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT29.T;The election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.D;Karl von Preysling has finally come back to his senses, announcing his support of Margarit de Biure against Jean de Montfort-Laval. With the German knights denouncing him along with a general lack of support from most of the various tongues, the chances of Montfort being elected have quite faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.A;Jean de Montfort-Laval wins despite the fierce opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.B;Pons de Margarit de Biure wins a large victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT30.T;A princely visit;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.D;The new prince of Malta has come to Paris following the celebrations of the new Maltese independence and the general reorganization of the state. As he is welcomed by the King, ministers discuss the new alliance between the archipelago and the Dual-Monarchy, securing the use of the naval bases in times of peace and war. Anglois capitalists discuss the opening of this new market while the Prince announced his marriage to the third removed cousin of the King, the duchess of Longueville. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.A;A new era for Malta and the Dual-Monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
##################### Synøe Events (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.T;The Pearl of the Antilles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.D;The Southern Islands, or as we call them the Synøe, are the pride of the Scandinavian colonial empire. The archipelago comprised of the main island of Kiskøyene and the secondary island of Righavn, is one of the main sources of colonial products be it sugar, coffee or chocolate. The slave population far surpasses the local settlers who come mainly from Scandinavia although many of the lower classes trace their ancestry to some Scottish clans deported them for their support during the Anglois occupation in the XVIIIth century. This pearl of the Antilles relies on slavery and we are sure to hear the settlers demand concessions if we were to abolish this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.A;It's not on the agenda, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.T;The Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.D;The law outlawing slavery has passed following a growth of Liberal thought in our country. But in the Caribbean this Act of the Rigsdag has seen wide condemnation from the settlers who condemn idealists knowing nothing of their lives and the benefits of slavery. They demand that the state assumes the financial loss they have to suffer because of the Act, a compromise many Liberals accept because of the infringment on private property this Act represents.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.A;We will pay for the emancipation of their slaves. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.B;Paying for having freed men, what nonsense is this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.T;The Kiskøyener Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.D;Pamphlets and slogans flourish in the Caribbean against Scandinavian rule following the refusal of Copenhagen to consider the side of the Kiskøyener planters. For many this is another sign that the relationship with the metropolis must end, as the island has no representation in Parliament and must always abide to the laws dictated by men who know nothing of the life in the Southern Islands. The Kiskøyener manifesto from Peter MacKristian is the most known of these works, and has become the main subject of conversation amongst the White population.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.A;They are just a colony, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.T;The independence of the Republic of Kiskøyene;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.D;As the situation of our state grew dire in the Antilles and abroad, the resistance against our rule increased. In these new circumstances, the old Planter elite along with the rest of the population declared the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, throwing away the representatives of Copenhagen and cutting ties with the metropolis.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.A;These islands were a burden anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.B;We will reconquer the Synøe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.T;The new Kiskøyener movement;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.D;In the last decades of the XIXth century, the islands of Sydøen experienced a national awakening. Distance from the motherland along with a difference in climate and general society had always made the Creole natives wary of the 'Northern' administrators. But the abolition of slavery led to a greater miscegenation among the lower classes, and the growing sentiment that the various populations, in all their differences, from the 'pure' Scandinavian Creole planters, to the mixed lower classes born from the mixing of Highlanders, Danish sailors and African slaves, had a common destiny and formed one nation. From autonomists to nationalists, all clamour for a new relationship with Scandinavia, which should hear them if it doesn't want conflict to erupt on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.A;Sydøen or Kiskøyene, call it as you want!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.T;The Sydøen dominion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.D;Demands of autonomy have grown over the years in our Antillean colonies, their people demanding a new relationship with the metropolis. As their societies developed and grew, it seemed inevitable to many that the Scandinavian government would have to grant them some power. It seems the easier way to maintain our control over these islands would be to associate them as a Dominion of the Crown, with their diplomacy aligned with the decisions in Copenhagen while leaving them masters of their economy, health and education. We could refuse that deal, but it would bolster the nationalist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.A;We welcome the new dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.B;They are not developed enough for that.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.C;We welcome the new dominion ! (play as them);;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.T;Competition in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.D;The rise of the New World powers has been a great concern for Scandinavia in the later years. Many Kiskøyener nationalists created exiled networks in these countries, rising public opinion against us. Then, they started coming back, harrassing the colonial police over the previous weeks. Now the situation has grown dire, with most of our forces in the islands trapped by the nationalists who proclaimed the independent United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, waiting for their benefactor to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SFJ12.T;Scandinavian decline;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.D;As Scandinavian power declined on the world stage over the years, the hopes of the nationalists in Sydøen rose. Our might is not what it was, and the locals saw it as less ships and colonial forces were put in the islands. In this situation, the nationalists gathered over the previous weeks, harassing local police forces and soldiers. Yesterday they felt strong enough to storm the palace of the governor and declare the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SFJ16.T;Suðurhafseyjar;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.D;Published in $YEAR$, the book 'The South Sea Islands' from Hans Johannesson was soon recognized as a monument of Icelandic litterature, and following his translation of the whole Scandinavian literature. Inspired by the life of the author who himself lived several years in the colony of Sydøen, the book describes the travels of a poor Icelandic, Sigurd Hansson. Following the deaths of his mother and sister he is forced to leave his homeland because of the misery he lives in. Arriving in Righavn he relates the beauty of this exotic land, only to witness the darker side of the Sydøen society : while slavery is abolished, the narrator witnesses the violence of the old masters on their freed workers and how Afro-Kiskøyener are only second-class citizens in the islands. Eventually the story ends on a note of hope, the Icelandic finding happiness after settling in a small village of the Kiskøyene interior with his wife. While praised for its literary quality by the various literary critics of Copenhagen and beyond, the book was also vividly criticized by Kiskøyener for his critics of their society along with the end chapter implying that the narrator marries a Black woman. Nonetheless, the attention the book received made the Synoe colony widely known as the 'Suðurhafseyjar' in the rest of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GEN1.T;A Precarious Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN1.D;The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the end of the Genoese republic that had existed for centuries thanks to his grip on the army. As of late, however, his autocratic rule has alienated him from several officers. Throughout Liguria, many resent him, from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. Among them is Gastone Buonaparte, former left hand of Della Rovere who has grown estranged over the years from the Duke. Rumor has it that some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some support and is well prepared to face his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN1.A;Let them come then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN2.T;The San Gian Batista insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN2.D;Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of Genoa and his holy day is a day of feasting for the city. It was on that fateful day that Gastone Buonaparte chose to act, mobilizing his soldiers to march on the ducal palace to expel Della Rovere and restore the Republic. The Duke, who was entertaining a few guests last night (some on Buonaparte’s secret payroll), is currently sleeping off a bit too much wine. If he is caught unaware then he is doomed, but he is a crafty man who might have an ace up his sleeve. For the sake of Genoa, we must take the risk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEN3.T;Restoration of the Superba;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN3.D;Gastone Buonaparte has triumphed! Della Rovere’s forces were quickly overpowered before most of them had even left their quarters. Unfortunately, the Duke himself was able to flee before he could be arrested – it seems that he had put a hidden passage into the palace for exactly this scenario, and was spirited out by a few loyal servants. But that is a concern for another day. For now let us celebrate the end of his tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN3.A;Molto bene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN4.T;The Duke Reigns Supreme;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN4.D;Lodovico della Rovere has triumphed! After being alerted to a disturbance near the palace, the duke quickly dressed for battle and led a group of bodyguards out to confront the traitor Buonaparte. The short but violent struggle in the palace courtyard saw Buonaparte slain in the melee, while the duke sustained only minor wounds. With loyal agents of the duke fanning out through Genoa to root out Buonaparte’s remaining loyalists, order shall soon be restored to the duchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN4.A;Long live the Duke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN5.T;Savoy and Genoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN5.D;The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere, has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows few signs of wanting to fight for his former title. As our own royal court sees it, this is a wonderful opportunity : Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our own Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly - lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN5.A;The Duke of Savoy is the rightful Duke of Liguria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN5.B;It isn't worth the cost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN6.T;La Superba Endures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN6.D;Overthrowing the tyrant Della Rovere did not bring a peaceful restoration of the old order. As soon as the news went out across the duchy, patricians began squabbling amongst themselves for political positions while the Duke of Savoy has been gathering armies on the border. Thankfully, all of this chaos was resolved when Buonaparte accepted the office of Doge and brought back order to the Republic by suppressing popular demands and using cooperative patricians to sabotage their seditious rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEN8.T;The Genoese insurrection of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN8.D;The Genoese people, notably its sailors had been the greatest losers of the new order. No one represented their cause, be it the old Duke, the Savoyards or the noble families and it was in this situation that the Comuni associations flourished thanks to Etrurian agents. Gathering students, workers and soldiers they tried to bring forth a democratic republic in Liguria but their insurrection was doomed from the start, having been infiltrated by spies of the regime. Nonetheless, barricades rose in the port and the streets of Genoa and the rebellion had to be crushed by force. For many it was the end of Liberal ideas in Liguria, but these martyrs proved a great asset for the democratic cause in Italy at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN8.A;Revolters get what they deserve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN9.T;The State of Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN9.D;Politics of Etruria have been growing more and more polarized after the revolutionary support for the short-lived Sicilian Republic ended in failure in 1830. Conservatives have taken back the upper hand in the legislature and government again advocating for the end of revolutionary actions and a policy of "normalization" of relations with the other powers in Italy. With the Genoese revolt, many Republicans from the Comuni associations hoped that this would force the Republic to assume the mantle of nationalism and liberalism in Italy. But its failure, has also strengthened the normalization supporters and now the Republic must decide to either support the 'Normalizzazione' policy, or support the underground factions of the Commons that still exist notably in Corsica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEN10.T;Chaos in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN10.D;Corsica has always been a periphery of the Republic of Genoa. Acquired in the Middle Ages from Pisa, it was for centuries a Genoese colony, the locals having no representation in the Republic and being forced to pay heavy taxes. To worsen this situation, Corsica is a poor mountainous island, whose society is held by clannish ties and honor, with frequent vendettas. The island is thus largely left to her own, with Genoa content with only exploiting the coast and its cities for money. The failed insurrection has however seen many revolutionaries fleeing to the island where they have contacted a notable leader from the interior, Mateo Falcone. Having studied in Bologna and fought as a mercenary all around Europe before assuming his position as head of his family in Corte, the general has attacked the ports and unified the island under his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN10.A;Now everyone waits for his next move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN11.T;A free Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN11.D;At last, Corsica is free from Genoese domination! For centuries the island has been exploited, his inhabitants dominated by the merchants of Liguria. But now the general Mateo Falcone has dared oust the local Genoese garrisons with the help of Genoese revolutionaries and has convoked a Diet in Corte in the centre of the island. The vote is simple he says : either Corsica joins the Revolutionaries of Etruria or she must stand alone and fight for her independence. Either way, the die is cast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEN18.D;The luxurious lifestyle of Lucca Della Rovere cost the state much and funds are lacking to continue his wills. His advisors have been forced to unusual funding ways and one has brought forward the idea of selling the island of Corsica. An uncivilized place for the Genoese, the island is poor and hard to administer, requiring garrisons to enforce law and order. Many powers would be interested in the island : Provence would appreciate ports closer to Etruria ; the Savoyards would strengthen their port in Nizza. Meanwhile, we could sell the island to private interests, notably the bank of Saint Georges who held the island in the first times of the Genoese conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GEN19.T;The incident of Pontenovu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN19.D;The Casa delle Compere di San Giorgio decided to place Corsican taxation into the hands of private companies, who receive part of the revenue. While this has reduced bank bureaucracy, it has also caused Corsican taxation to become dominated by coercion. A recent incident demonstrated the pitfalls of this system. A patrol of taxation agents cornered Yvan Simeoni, a brigand of local fame, at the Pontenovu Bridge. The man was a bit of a folk hero, robbing several nobles (who had paid bribes to avoid most taxes) and dispersing some money back to the common people (who were often forced to pay extortionate sums to the agents), and unfortunately decided to go down fighting. His death has turned Pontenovu into a place of pilgrimage for Corsican nationalists, and has caused separatist sentiments to explode across Corsica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However, it has been Genoese since the XVth century and allowing the Corsicans to go free would only bolster the masses in Genoa to rise up once more. In the end, the Duke chose;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN23.A;the interests of the Bank and Genoa are one and the same!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN23.B;The Bank will still have to pay its contract without the island!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN24.T;The Sale of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN24.D;The Genoese government has approached us to propose the sell of the island of Corsica to our country. The island lies in the centre of our interests, between the Duchy of Provence and the former grand-duchy of Tuscany we aim to reconquer. This is then a perfect opportunity for us despite the cost the Genoese demand. We also know that the Corsicans are a hard people to rule over and that it may overextend our armies to garrison the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN24.A;We will pay for this magnificent opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN24.B;The price is too steep;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN25.T;The sell of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN25.D;Following the acceptance of $FROMCOUNTRY$, Corsica has been sold by the Duchy of Genoa. Centuries of Genoese domination have thus ended over a commercial contract and already the $FROM_COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is hailed in Bastia and Ajaccio!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN25.A;A small price to pay for the island of Beauty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN26.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refused our proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN26.D;We have not found a buyer for Corsica in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Having overheard the negotiations, the Aragonese ambassador has stepped forward to propose that his country buy the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN26.A;Well, we’ll send them the offer…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN27.T;The Sale of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN27.D;The island of Corsica was once Aragonese during the Middle Ages but was lost to the Republic of Genoa. We made no attempts at retaking the island over the centuries because it is poor and Sardinians were hard enough to control. But recent developments in the duchy of Genoa has led the Duke to propose to sell the island. With our recent advances in Italy we’d benefit heavily from controlling the island, allowing us to bolster our influence in the Tyrrhenian sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN27.A;Buy Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN27.B;The price is too steep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN28.T;Aragon Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN28.D;To the surprise of much of the government, two foreign powers have refused to buy the island of Corsica. We are now forced to turn to the bank of Saint Georges who will not hesitate on the contract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN28.A;The deal is done then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN29.T;The Sale of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN29.D;The Genoese government has approached us to propose the sale of the island of Corsica to our country. The island lies not far from our main port of Nizza and would give us an advanced base to further our influence in Central Italy. This is then a perfect opportunity for us despite the cost which the Genoese demand. We also know that the Corsicans are a hard people to rule over and that it may overextend our armies to garrison the island;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN29.A;Pay the demanded price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN29.B;It is not in our interests;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN30.T;Brigandry in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN30.D;Our hold on Corsica is tenuous since our acquisition of the island. Our attempts to take control of the whole island and not just the port cities like Genoa before us have been met with the rise of roaming bands of brigands fighting our soldiers and administrators. Various Liberal pamphlets have been found throughout Corsica and not a week goes by without some attack on our authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN30.A;We paid before and yet we must continue, it seems….;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN31.T;The secession of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN31.D;After having acquired the island of Corsica, $COUNTRY$ encountered the same problems as Genoa : they faced a poor, mountainous island inhabited by an unruly people divided in various clans that often prefered violence to resolve their disputes than recognizing the justice of their new government. Etruria disseminated pamphlets and weapons on the island whenever it could, bolstering Republicanism among the Corsicans. The defeat of $COUNTRY$$ against Etruria was the nail in the coffin : the Corsican leader Mateo Falcone took opportunity of the disarray of the local forces to take control of the ports and proclaimed Corsica united with Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN31.A;Talk about a bad investment....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN320.T;The sell of Douala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN320.D;After Corsica, another of our territories has been proposed for sell. Genoa has held on to African ports in Guinea thanks to the investments of our merchants in the slave trade. But since it has began to decline, these ports cost us more than we benefit from holding them. It has thus been proposed to sell either to the Dual-Monarchy, Spain or Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN320.A;Paris might want it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN320.B;The King of Spain already owns the islands next to it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN320.C;Burgundy always wants more colonial endeavours;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN33.T;African port for sale;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN33.D;The Duchy of Genoa has approached us to buy the ports they hold in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN33.A;A small cost to pay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN33.B;We don't want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN34.T;They accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN34.D;We will now cede the ports in Africa to $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN34.A;I love the sound of money;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN35.T;They refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN35.D;Sadly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ refused our proposal of sell, leaving us with those territories we wanted to let go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GEN35.A;A shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC1.T;Exile of the Conservatives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC1.D;Following the latest elections in Florence, the politicians deemed not revolutionary enough were purged by the Commons crowds, leading to many fleeing abroad. Among them, the head of diplomacy of the previous Directorate, Filipe Mosca has demanded asylum to the duchess Marguerite. Demanding an audience, he has pledged his support and political power to her, were she to accept a Constitution. Mosca has connections throughout Italy and also the Tuscan people, giving some support to his claim. However, the duchy of Lucca was formed on counterrevolutionary thesis, and the duchess might prefer to follow the way dictated by her father and her tutors rather than a Republican turncoat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC1.A;Our situation is precarious enough for this proposal to look interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUCA.B;He can go elsewhere, for the Duchess reigns legitimately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC2.T;Reviving the Alessandrist dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC2.D;The promulgation of the Charter has led to several high ranking Tuscan Republicans joining the Duchy, fearing the revolutionary trend that has taken power in Florence. Mosca, now a Count and chief of the government has come to the Duchess with a proposal : as she is still unmarried, she may marry the Duke of Parma, Francesco II Maria Farnese-Piacenza whose father had abdicated in 1835. With this marriage would come the union of the two small duchies, paving a united front against the Republic under a Liberal monarchy, just like Alessandro Farnese tried in the 1820’s..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC2.A;Send the proposal then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC3.T;A most tempting union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC3.D;A proposal has come from the duchy of Lucca for our Duke to marry with the Duchess and form a united front against the Republican hydra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC3.A;Of course we accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC3.B;We have other prospects;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC4.T;The union of Margot and Francesco;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC4.D;Francesco and Margerita have wed in the cathedral of Lucca. Acquired to the plans of the Prime minister Mosca, Francesco has already applied the Charter to his demesne and began the reform of the state and military. Both of them have also devised a plan to convince his cousin Francesco of Farnese-Reggio to abdicate in Modena to unify the Emilian duchies and plan the later reconquest of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Francesco of Modena is a libertine, and he would be more fit to live a pleasant life as a member of the aristocracy than as ruler of a small state in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC4.A;We are making him an offer he can’t refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC5.T;Modena and Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC5.D;The duchy of Modena has received an audience from the duchy of Lucca-Parma to ask for the abdication of our Duke in favour of his cousin. The duke and duchess promise Fernando a hefty sum for this act while several secrets could leak through the press about the lowly manners of his Ducal majesty if the wrong choice was made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC5.A;I never wanted to rule anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC5.B;WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC6.T;The abdication of Fernando I of Modena;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC6.D;Through diplomacy, Mosca has managed to acquire yet another duchy for his duchess. Fernando of Modena has relinquished his Duchy to his cousin of Parma and now the same reforms that were introduced in Parma will be done to Modena. With the Farnese duchies united, it seems nothing will prevent Lucca to reconquer Tuscany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC6.A;next year in Florence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC7.T;War against the Republican Abomination;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC7.D;For the first time since the revolutionary wars that convulsed Europe a generation ago, the rough beast of mobocracy has raised its ugly head in our own homeland. The Etrurian Republic is slouching towards our fair realm, and if they triumph it shall mean the ruination of both Lucca and Italy. God and the Law are with us, as, like David, we face down the Goliath of the Philistines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LUC7.A;Long live the Grand Duchess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.T;The Buonaparte Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.D;The proclamation of the duchy of Genoa by the former Doge Lodovico Della Rovere was not accepted by all in the Republic. Troubles brewed in Corsica for the past years, the island being notoriously hard to administer for the Ligurians. Eventually, the chief of the garrison of the island, Pietro Buonaparte declared that the Duke was an usurpator and that no Corsican would bow to the whims of a monarch. Without a fight, the various soldiers scattered around the island surrendered as Buonaparte was proclaimed Dictator of the Corsican Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.A;A rebellious island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.T;The Republican threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.D;The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the ending of the Genoan republic that had existed for centuries and was done thanks to his grip over the army. But lately his autocratic rule has alienated him several officers and throughout Liguria many resent him from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. With the Buonaparte insurrection in Corsica, some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some supports and is well prepared to face his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.A;The rebellion is crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.B;Lodovico I flees the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.T;Savoy and Genoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.D;The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows little signs of wanting to fight for his former title. For the court of our Duke, it is a wonderful opportunity : Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly- lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.A;The Duke of Savoy is the rightful Duke of Liguria:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.B;It isn't worth the cost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.T;Stabilization of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.D;Overthrowing the tyran Della Rovere did not bring a peaceful restoration of the old order. Patricians squabbled among themselves for political positions while the Duke of Savoy gathered armies on the border. But in the end all was resolved when the Dictator of Corsica, Pietro Buonaparte accepted the office of Doge and brought back the island into the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.A;La Superba will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.T;The matter of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.D;Politics of Etruria have been growing more and more polarized after the revolutionary support for the short-lived Sicilian Republic ended in failure. Conservatives have taken back the upper hand in the legislature and government but Liberals still exert a vast influence. With the Corsican revolt ending the tyranny of Lodovico Della Rovere, many Republicans hoped that he would grant more liberties to the Corsican people. But eventually, Buonaparte ended ruling with an iron fist over the island, while members of the Society of the Commons were declared bandits and outlaws. Now the Republic must decide to either support the 'Protector of Corsica' who is still an ardent Republican, or support the underground factions of the Commons. His rule is far from assured and a few weapons and official support could easily lead to a popular uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.A;Stability is paramount : support Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.B;A republic without freedom means nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.T;The deposition of Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.D;After months of local infighting between the supporters of Buonaparte and the popular movements, Etruria finally offered her support to the Commons. A Tuscan ship boarded the Eastern Coast, supplying Antonio Paoli, former officer under Buonaparte, weapons to act. His partisans crossed the maquis and finally arrived in Corte where Buonaparte had established his government. The fighting was swift as partisans attacked the city from all sides, with Buonaparte surrendering mere minutes after the beginning of the attack. The manifesto of the Commons was soon printed en masse and shared throughout the island with the various villages and families of Corsica rejoicing over the new state of affairs. The first action of the Paoli government was to proclaim an alliance with Etruria and vowing to help in the overthrow of the Old order in Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.A;Viva Corsica!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.T;Revolution in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.D;Following the official support of the Etrurian republic for the Commons in Corsica, weapons were given to the leader of the resistance Antonio Paoli who then took nearly without any blood spilled the city of Corte where the government was hosted. A democratic Republic has been established in Corsica and Buonaparte will face a trial for his crimes agains the people. Paoli has pledged to support us in any endeavours we may face against the Reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.A;Now Corsica, soon all of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.T;The election of 1838;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.D;The Etrurian Republic has been experimenting a Byzantine system of government whose all goal is to prevent the rise of either Reactionaries or Radical Revolutionaries to power. The Republic is ruled through Councils that choose various the ministers and consuls of the Republic. Among the various councils the most important is the 200 Council, which is partially elected every 3 years, with one third of the seats to be filled in the coming election. The current legislature is divided, and despite the censitary vote in effect, the Republicans have a great chance at gaining a large majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.A;Who will win ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.D;After the votes were counted the 200 Council saw a Moderate majority seated. Among the members of the Society of the Commons, rumors spread of a plot to extinguish the Revolutionary flame once and for all by confiscating the election. The people was soon in arms in Florence, while soldiers were divided on how to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.A;The people end the Moderate governement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.B;The army sides with the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.D;The Republicans ended up winning the election, notably thanks to the vote of the soldiers, exempted from having to require to pay taxes to vote. But the Moderate Consuls did not intent to let the Republicans take power in the Republic. They soon called upon the army to storm the Parliament and arrest Republicans. Street fights were undecisive as many soldiers preferred to side with the popular movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.A;The Moderates restore Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.B;The Republicans crush the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is a threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our rights to the grand duchy of Tuscany. Medicis have ruled the city of Florence for 4 centuries and it is time we renew with this tradition. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power. It would be a perfect occasion as the Republic is currenty divided and the rebels squabbling among themselves. What do we choose ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.A;Nous reprendrons nos droits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.B;Le risque est trop grand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUS11.T;A stable Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.D;The Revolution has now ended. For too many years, Liberals and secret societies seeked to embroil Etruria once again in war against our Holy Faith and the various monarchs of the peninsula. While it is true that overthrowing the Old Order was justified we must take a diplomatic stance rather than risk a war we cannot win. Etruria will thus abandon the violence of the past years but not the Italian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.A;Nessuna rivoluzione ma nessun Antico Regime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.T;A revolutionary Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.D;The Revolution has been hampered for too many years by the Moderate efforts to acquire 'normalized relations' with the reactionary states that surround us which only paved the way for the Provencal attempt to restore the Antico Regime. The people has been heard, and the Etrurian Republic will not stop until all Italy is liberated from its oppresive monarchs and foreign tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.A;Unione Forza e Liberta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.T;An opportunity in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.D;The current attempt of the Duke of Provence to reclaim Tuscany allows us to more easily take Corsica, which is a rightful part of the Duchy of Genoa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.A;The island will accept its new master by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.B;What could we do with Corsica ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.T;Reclaiming Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.D;The duchy of Lucca is an artificial construction of the partisans of the Antico Regime. Following the peace of Lucca of 1814 the Gonzaga of Milan organized the creation of a monarchist state in Lucca and also encompassing the former duchy of Massa with Jean of Valois-Forcalquier, cousin of the King in France, proclaimed monarch of this petty state. His daughter Marguerite who succeeded him in 1827 enjoys little sympathy from the population and it will not be hard for our armies to bring back the Revolution to these territories:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.A;Lucca is Etrurian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.T;Ending the Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.D;Following the foolish attempt of Alessandro IV of Parma to establish a Constitutional Kingdom of Italy in the 1820's, his domains were split between his cousins Alessandro V in Parma and Ferdinando in Modena. Both claim the duchy of Massa from Lucca and have sent demands of aid to all the other monarchs in Italy, or so our spy networks tell us. We must end these petty duchies and united the people of Emilia in our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.A;Onwards to Parma and Modena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.T;The Romagnol uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.D;Romagna was the second centre of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of Bologna had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, the order came back to Romagna and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors from the oldest university of Europe. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. But with our brothers in Tuscany having rekindled the flame of liberty, secret societies in Bologna have risen the tricolor and the Papal officials were forced to flee as the revolutionaries decided to join with Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.A;Italia unita !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.T;Romagna joins us !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.D;Our success in Italy and our support for revolutionaries has rekindled the revolutionary fervour in Romagna. From the Liberal bastion of Bologna, where many of our leaders have been formed, the Patriots rose against the Papal garrison and agents who were thrown out. Then the Bologna assembly decided to join back Etruria to advance the National and Revolutionary cause. While an interesting prospect for us, it also enraged the Papacy who consider that we have invaded their territory. We might soon hear from Aragonese threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.A;Viva Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.T;Loss of Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.D;Romagna has risen against our power and pledged itself to the heathen radicals of Etruria. Always a hotbed of radicalism and agitation, it seems our rule through the use of the Inquisition alienated the good people of Romagna. The Papal army is weak, and Etruria has engineered many plots over the years so the Curia is weary of trying to fight them. We will wait for our Aragonese protectors to help us in that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.A;The Church has endured for centuries, we can endure such a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.T;Commons in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.D;Memories from the 1827 and 1828 uprising that saw the creation of the Neapolitan and Sicilian Republics are still vividly remembered in our Republic along with the restoration of order that followed by the tyrannous Catalans. All revolutionaries know it : the main menace for the Republic comes from Barcelona for it is because of Barcelona that the Pope still reigns with an iron fist over Central Italy. With our success in restoring Republican rule over Central Italy, the networks of the Commons Societies in Southern Italy have gathered again. We could begin help them organize so that they would rise should Aragon decide to try to end the Revolution. However such a move would be hard to hide from Catalan spies and could give further reasons to the Catalans to attack us ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.A;Il suon d'ogni squilla i Vespri suonò!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.B;We have learnt from 1828, leave the Southern peasants on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.T;The second Italian Coalition war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.D;As many aristocrats and conservatives flock into Naples, we are forced to admit that the old Revolutionary threat in Tuscany has grown again and threatens our hegemony. We must gather our forces and restore order to Northern Italy lest we see the Green-White-Red tricolour fly over Rome, Naples and Palermo! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.A;God is with us in this holy war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.B;We can’t risk our holdings…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.T;The Second Parthonepean Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.D;Our attack against Tuscany has rallied the unruly crowds of Napoli who have risen once again against our rule. Hopefully their rule does not extend over the whole South given their opposition to Santamarians, but they can still pose a threat to our current war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.A;End this petty ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.T;The Napolitan and Sicilian uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.D;Etrurian agents had been plotting against us for years and they had sent agents to Napoli and Sicily to create a network of informants and rebels they could arm should we go to war with them. With our armies rallied to fight the Tuscan insurgents in the North, the Italian tricolour was flown over the citadel of Naples and much of Sicily, the revolutionaries hoping to win their freedom. Hopefully, we can squash these revolts again and teach the Southerners that Order is paramount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.A;We will win !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.T;Proposal of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.D;A proposal has come from the Republic of Etruria. Having abandoned their revolutionary heritage for reason, they have proposed a peaceful unification of the Peninsula in a weak confederation that would be headed by the Pope while preserving the rights of all members and its own laws. This could be an interesting proposal to end the bickering between Italian statelets and avoid a forceful unification like dreamed about by the Savoyards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.A;This is a very interesting proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.B;We are better off alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.C;This is a very interesting proposal (Switch to Tuscany);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.T;Formation of the Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.D;Italian nationalism has never really gone away despite the end of Revolution in Italy. As threats grow, the Pope, the Republic of Tuscany and Milano have decided to join in a Confederation that will be headed by his Holiness. The rights of all states adhering to the Confederation will be respected, with the Confederal government only in charge of war, trade and diplomacy. This Confederation is already very criticized, notably in Savoy who has been a prime opponent of the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.A;One Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.T;Failure of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.D;The Council we had assembled to create a new Italian Confederation ended after the refusal of several members to join…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.A;It was just a dream after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.T;Crossing the Po;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.D;The Etrurian hydra roars again. Terrorists strike in all Italy while the barbarous legions of Florence have exiled the Farnese from their duchies. Leopoldo I stands ready to end the Etrurian menace once again as he did in his youths when hordes of peasants and atheists had taken the ancestral seat of his family in Mantua, and end once and for all the threat they pose to the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.A;Florence will be freed from barbary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.B;Crossing the river would be foolish : watch the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.T;Milanese attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.D;The Milanese Duke has decided to attack us, citing various grievances, notably the annexation of his cousins’ duchies in Emilia. His goal is nothing less than walking over Florence and end the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.A;To Arms Citizens !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.T;The Transpadan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.D;Our forces have vanquished the Gonzaga duke, who is now in exile in Germany. Our forces secured the help of local revolutionaries who have been put in charge of the new Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.A;With this, the Revolution grows stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.T;The Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.D;Following the victory over the Republic of Etruria, Duke Leopoldo was perplexed about what should be done with the new demesne he held. Milan having defeated Etruria was the prime pretender to the defunct Kingdom of Italy but at the same time it would have been an acceptance of the revolutionary ideals Leopoldo had fought against for the past years. He thus decided to unite Northern Italy in a neutral confederation with the Pope, as suggested by Neo-Guelphists. Modena and Parma would be restored with the Farnese reinvited while the former duchess of Lucca would be crowned as grand duchess of Tuscany. With this new arrangement and Leopoldo as president of the Confederation, stability came back to Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.A;An Italian confederation will preserve stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29B.T;The Borgia Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29B.D;Following the victory over the Republic of Etruria, Maria Borgia and her husband Massimiliano visited the former duchy of Tuscany that had been scarred by years of revolutionary troubles and atheist anarchists. There, they found former Republicans rallying to their cause and the Charter, embracing the new stability that it brought to their country. But for this dream to be realized, the Gonzaga-Borgias had to form a united Italy that could neutralize the revolutionary fervor and help the peninsula restore its grandeur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29B.A;The Charter was but the first step to a unified Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
TUS30.T;Marianist insurrection in Naples!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.D;Following the promulgation of the so-called 'Borgia Charter' by the Duke of Milan, Maria Borgia headed to Naples to claim her lost crown. Supported by Marianist networks, the garrison was soon overwhelmed and she could enter the city with minimal resistance. With the fall of the city, the countryside followed as many lords changed allegiances and peasants joined the Marianist banditry. War will come soon to the Boot of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.A;If one abdication is not enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.T;The March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.D;The South has heard the call of her rightful sovereign as crowds gather to be armed and fight the Aragonese throughout the Kingdom of Naples. Between our current possessions and the South lie the prize of Italy, Rome still governed by the Church. The Pope has refused to grant us access, stating that Maria had no rights to Naples since her abdication. We have no choice but to declare war on the Papal State to make sure that the Marianists are not isolated in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.A;If we can take Rome in the process ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.T;The unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.D;When Maria Borja, queen of Aragon was deposed by Josep Serna in 1835 no one thought that she could become Queen again. The masses of the South rose to her call to fight Aragon. After a successful march on Rome she joined the armies of her husband Massimiliano Maria Visconti and managed to force Aragon to recognize her as the legitimate sovereign of Naples. With their victory over Etruria and the Aragonese, Massimiliano and Maria were eventually proclaimed the rightful sovereigns of Italy, despite the Pope, a mere puppet of Barcelona, refusing to accept this new order. Challenges await the Visconti-Borgia as Italy is yet to be completely united but crowds rejoice, for it has been centuries since the end of the Kingdom of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.A;Viva Massimiliano! Viva Maria ! Viva Italia ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.T;La Regina Margot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.D;The first representation of the new play of Dominico Rezzi, 'La Regina Margherita' was met with great acclaim in Milan. It retells the story of the Great Italian War (1539-1546) originating in the succession of Margherita I de Valois on the throne of Milan. Breaking with the classical rules, the play mixes tragical elements with grotesque scenes. The author notably represented the death of Francesco de Valois, duke of Milan during the Italian Wars, in an undignified manner that was criticized by many critics. The success of the play can be partially explained by the nationalist subtext : Margherita, the duchess of Milan must choose between a Borja and a Plantagenet to marry and her eventual wedding to the Dauphin is seen as the lesser of two evils both for her and for Italy. After a dozen of representations the play  was censored in the Duchy, the Duke consedering it a criticism of the future-Duchess Maria Borgia, .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.A;A shame our Duke dislikes good theatre...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.T;The Republican Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.D;Following a commission and gifts from all parts of the Republic, a new monument was unveiled in Florence. A statue was erected in honor of the Republican heroes Goffredo Baccarani and his wife Mariana Angeliotti. Baccarani secured the existence of the Republic in its first years and nearly managed to unify Northern Italy until he was shot in the leg and forced to retreat from the battlefields. His wife ruled the Republic in his absence through a network of yesmen allowing her to overcome the fact that women were not allowed to exercize charges. Even after the Moderate takeover of the Republic, Mariana continued to head the popular movements until she was shot by a priest in 1821. An immense crowd gathered to pay their respects to the Father and especially the Mother of the Republic, who now watch over the city from the hill of the Oltrarno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.A;Statues to honor Republicans not Tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.T;The Crown of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.D;The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja, which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples, his brother and heir Ferran VI, died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV, Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive, for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them, Milan may especially prove troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.T;The escape of Maria Borja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.D;Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan, Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples. While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy, she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions, the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. In the night of the 25th February 1837, she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria, heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.A;Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.T;Maria Borgia, future duchess of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.D;Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I, the prince of Legnano, in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes, with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri. Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General, Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke, Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon, as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo, the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily, so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.A;Maria will become Queen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.T;The House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.D;The house of Savoy is one of the mightiest houses of Italy. Ever since the XVIIth century, our power has grown in Italy proper while our Transalpine possessions becoming more of an afterthought. The conquest of Monferrato and Novara from the Duchy of Milan in the late XVIIIth century saw us put firmly in the Anglois sphere. To many in Turin it appears that we could leverage our Western possessions against military help to form a united Italy. At least, we will not bow down so easily to other would-be unifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.A;FERT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.T;Our chance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.D;The call to unity from Maria Borgia and the current war against Aragon appear to many officials as the perfect opportunity for our state to gain ascendency. But at the same time, this would alienate our friends in Paris which are still interested in our Savoyard possessions and we would be alone in this war. Let us backstab our rivals in Milan and become the true unifiers of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.A;To Milan and more !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.B;Now is not the right time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.T;Ending the Revolutionary threat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.D;The Etrurian republic which has been the greatest threat to stability and tradition in Italy in the recent past is now at war with the Aragonese Crown. We can’t let either win : Etruria securing its independence would inspire revolutionaries everywhere in Italy while Aragon restoring order would just hamper our claims to the old Kingdom of Italy. We must thus cross the border and attack the so called ‘heart of the Revolution’ and bring glory and unity to the peninsula. But at the same time, this would alienate us our friends in Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.A;We will end the ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.B;Let them fight, we can pick up the scraps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.T;The isolation of Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.D;Turin has profited from the current state of war between us and Central Italy to backstab our enemies and proclaim that they are the only worthy unifier of Italy. While it will make our war easier, we must profit from the opportunity to bring Piedmont under our domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.A;The house of Savoy must end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.B;We must focus on our current war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.T;Foreign Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.D;$COUNTRY$ faces war as foreigners have crossed our borders and threaten to topple us. This has created a large surge of patriotism so our lands do not fall to foreign domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.A;For Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.T;The fate of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.D;With our influence secured in Savoy, our state can easily obtain their western territories on our side of the Alps in exchange for support in creating an Italian state. At the same time, some jingoists in our state recall that we could take opportunity of their relative weakness to crush the Savoyard state and annex it in its entirety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.A;Savoy is enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.B;We will cross the Alps as conquerors !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR7.T;The fate of Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR7.D; With our influence secured in Piedmont, our state can easily obtain their western territories on our side of the Alps in exchange for support in creating an Italian state. At the same time, some jingoists in our state recall that we could take opportunity of their relative weakness to crush the Piedmontese state and annex it in its entirety;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR7.A;Savoy is enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR7.B;Turin and Genoa are rightfully ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.T;The threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.D;With the house of Savoy under threat from invaders from beyond the Alps, the political climate in the Italian confederation has drastically changed. With their rivals from Turin not able to deny their legitimacy and the threat caused by the invasion, the Italian confederation has declared itself the rightful Italian state and has received the support of most of the Italian patriots in doing so. The squabbles between the various members have also been put aside, creating a federal government with far more prerogatives than the old Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.A;Avanti Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$’s proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.D;$ FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials have proposed us their help in the unification of Italy under our state in exchange for the promise of our Savoyard possessions. It is true that our state was created in the Alpine valleys and that the royal house is known as the house of Savoy. But these are rural and enclaved lands, and not many want to keep them when we can easily trade them for the whole peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.A;If they honor the deal, we will give them Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.B;We can’t renounce the lands of our ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ accepted !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted to let go of the Alps in exchange for our military aid against the Italian confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.A;A good trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.D;Following agreements between the house of Savoy and $FROMCOUNTRY$, the government of $COUNTRY$ has declared war on the weak Italian confederation, proclaiming that Italy needs a strong and united government rather than the mess that the Compromesso created. It is a war opposing Italian against Italian, with the support of foreigners, and whatever the end, it will change Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.A;Let us hope for the better…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.T;A Geographical Construct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.D;Italy has been ‘united’ by $FROMCOUNTRY$. A weak puppet state only controlling Northern Italy, not even Rome, this new state has already been heavily criticized by the Italian patriots who see it only as the result of another foreign imperialist. While it appeared to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government as the best option to stabilize Italy, this may lead to a renewed era of instability from the various groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.A;At least there is an Italy I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.T;Il Compromesso;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.D;The Italian Confederation is a loose compromise between the various powers of Central Italy. It satisfies no one, and few people consider it the rightful Italian state. Unless the state can assert itself in the coming years, it may easily fall to infighting and instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.A;We will unite Italy nonetheless !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful. Nonetheless, our old rival in Turin, propped up by foreign powers, has apparently decided to approach the Confederation for a proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.A;It is strange …;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful. Many officials demand a new general reunion of our members to discuss the state of the Confederation and its future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.A;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.T;Approaching the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.D;The Confederation while weak is still the main contender to the unification of Italy. With no strong foreign support for our cause, we have stood as rivals for decades without any particular change to the global situation. With critics accumulating of the Confederation, it seems to many officials that it would be the right time to join it, and use our influence and might to appoint our government and unite Italy. But at the same time, it is a risky move, and we could let the Confederation fail and dissolve on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.A;Integrate the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.B;Integrate the Confederation (player only);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.C;Better to let it fall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.T;The new Savoyard government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.D;The house of Savoy had bided its time but they have successfully managed to take control of the Confederation by appointing their chosen government with the help of many Italian nationalists and various opponents inside the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.A;What does this entail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.T;The Council of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.D;The various officials of the Italian states who are members of the Confederation have gathered in $THISCAPITAL$ to discuss the future of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.A;The dice is cast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.T;A Stable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.D;While many thought that the Confederation was living its last hours, temperance has prevailed in the Council, as all its members recognized that they were better in this Confederation than independent and only to be prey to the Aragonese and Piedmontese. Thus endures the Confederation, and maybe one day, it will be the legitimate Italian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.A;Long live the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.T;Collapse of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.D;The compromise that created the Italian confederation has failed to endure. The various members of this polity decided to dissolve the state and go their separate ways following decades of political inertia and divisions. Italy becomes fractured again, and no one knows who will profit from this return to the old times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.A;Damn the divisions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.T;The Unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.D;Following the appointment of the Piedmontese grand-duke as head of the Confederation, many feared that the Aragonese would try to disrupt the new power in the North. But unable to intervene, this has left the Savoyards to cement their rule of the Confederation and finally proclaim a united Italian Kingdom under their helm. Now Italy exists, and not just as a weak state unable to resolve disputes between the various interests groups that composed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.A;Avanti Italia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.T;Savoyard Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.D;A weak Italian Confederation served our interests well since it allowed us to play the various members of this state one against another. But the pesky Savoyards have appointed their own government following the recent political instability in the Confederation, and if we don’t act soon they could easily proclaim a united Italy. Our best chance is to secure Rome and the Pope swiftly and deal with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.A;Rome must be protected !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.B;We are not strong enough to face the Savoyards…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.T;The Italian Liberation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.D;Aragonese troops walked into Rome following the announcement of the reorganization of the Confederation under the house of Savoy. This is an outrage to all Italian patriots and it has strengthened our rule. But we must march south unless we want Italy to still be disunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.A;To Rome !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.B;The Confederation is fine without the South…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.T;Victory of the House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.D;The mobilized forces of the reorganized Italian confederation have liberated Rome from Aragonese occupation. Following this tremendous success, the Grand-Duke of Piedmont was officially crowned King of Italy and abolished the former Confederation. A new power has emerged on the European scene, and soon Italy will surely be completely independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.A;FERT !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.T;Victory of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.D;The Italian Confederation could not vanquish our forces in Rome, leaving us in control of the old city, the Pope and crushing any hope the Savoyards entertained about using the Confederation as a tool for their ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.A;Our ambitions are intact !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.T;Intervention in Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.D;The Papal states have been recreated only to be annexed by us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.A;A good conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.D;Backed by foreign interests, Piedmont has declared war on the Italian Confederation. Should they win, they will not stop at just Northern Italy, already planning for the conquest of our southern holdings. Now is the time for action and war against the Confederation to carve the North before Savoyards take it. Although that also means that we could end up facing the Great Power that protects and helps them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR27.B;We can’t risk it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR28.T;Aragonese intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR31.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.D;Taking advantage of our disorder following our unification of the Italian peninsula, an envoy from Burgundy has come to press their claims on the region of Savoy. While the region has been under Italian rule for centuries the population itself is of mixed stock, with the francophone Romand comprising a slight majority. Based on this majority, the Burgundians seem insistent on claiming the territory, with the Burgundian envoy hinting at war were we to refuse their claims. As Savoy has been a part of an Italian state for centuries, nationalists have called upon us to defend the territory against Burgundian aggression. On the other hand, the Romand majority that inhabits Savoy is culturally much closer to the Burgundians than the Italians, and to reject their demands would mean perpetual enmity between ourselves and the Burgundians. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.A;We shall recognize their claims. Savoy belongs to Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.B;Italy stands united! It will not be chipped away be foreign actors!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COUITA.T; Beginning of the Florence National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
COUITA.D;’The explicit purpose of this assembly is to put an Italian people's association in the place of the existing division of princedoms, to bring the Italian nation to real unity, to strengthen Italian national feeling, and thus to raise Italy’s power both internal and external’ - Salvatore Cavour, elected Chairman of the First Italian National Assembly\n\n Following the successes of Etruria in Emilia, the revolutionary government sent a call for Italian patriots to elect representatives for the gathering of a National assembly in Florence. While the assembly’s representation was doubtful at best because of reactionary repression of elections throughout the peninsula, it allowed Etruria to gather revolutionaries and Liberals from the whole peninsula to prepare the unification and many of them would attain great political careers once unification was achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
COUITA.A;Let this be the beginning of greater things to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
COUITA1.T;The Bolognese Delegation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
COUITA1.D; Romagna was the second centre of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of the oldest university of Europe had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, Romagna was reconquered by the reactionary coalition and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule which began in 1815, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors that found haven in Florence and Pisa. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. Describing the situation, Fabrizio Verdi, head of the Liberal student association of Bologna has pledged to do anything in his power to make the Etrurian flag fly from the towers of the city again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

COUITA2.T;A delegation from Naples and Palermo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
COUITA2.D;”The Italian people, in order to be free, had kings and priests to combat. To obtain a constitution founded on liberty it had the prejudices of eighteen centuries to overcome. Priestcraft, feudalism, despotism, have successively, for two thousand years, governed Sicily. We have given you liberty. Take care you preserve it” \n\n This extract of the famous speech of Beccarini during his Neapolitan campaign of 1809 summarizes the attitude of the Etrurian Republic towards the South : a land to be enlightened and freed by force. But the Revolution never really took hold there, mainly because of the great religious fervour of the peasant masses and the unwillingness of the elites to compromise with their privileges. First during the Revolutionary War, and then in 1828-1829, the Etrurian saw their efforts fail with the Aragonese reconquest of the Neapolitan and Sicilian republics. Nonetheless, the Republics of Naples and Messina still inspire Southern Liberals who have come here to testify of their willingness to rise again against Aragonese oppression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

COUITA3.D;The North of Italy is divided between the house of Savoy and the house of Gonzaga, both trying to assert their hegemony over the other since the rise of the Gonzagas as dukes of Milan of 1771 and the war that followed over Monferrato in 1784-1786. Both houses have fought Etruria and the rise of Liberal ideas and remain a threat for the Italian Republican cause. Nonetheless recent developments might allow the Republicans to prevail in either : Leopoldo I of Milan is aging, and his son married to the former Aragonese queen Maria Borgia tries to quicken the succession to play his hand. Meanwhile, Savoy’s alliance with the Dual-Monarchy is fragile and not as secure as it appears at first glance. Etruria must thus tread carefully by dealing with those Dukes since either princedom has more soldiers than the Republic could hope to muster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Etruria, while a formidable force in Italy is still weaker than all of their enemies combined and its resources are scarce.

The Council of Etruria has reignited the spirit of republicanism and of nationalism in places where the reactionary regimes of Italy had long thought them extinguished. In the universities and the salons, revolutionary societies are again cropping up, as in the days just before the Italian Wars, and on the streets of the capitals of the myriad Italian states one can see the the Tricolor waving in defiance of the ancien régime. Soon, the whole of Italy shall again be consumed by the flames of revolution, though it remains to be seen if she will emerge from the ashes as a phoenix or be forever shattered by the ambitions of foreign kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT2.D;'The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters. `\n \n In the fields, at the streetcorners, and in the salons, when one questions another about the state of affairs in Italy one invariably finds the same response: change is coming. On the surface, the many monarchs of Italy appear to reign unchallenged as they have since the end of the Italian Wars, but as one walks through the cities of Italy one will witness the breakdown of royal authority, as peasant and soldier scuffle in the streets in a manner unthinkable a few years prior. Though open rebellion has yet to break out, fires long thought extinguished have proven themselves to be merely smoldering, awaiting the right opportunity to reignite, and whispers abound as to what will follow when they inevitably do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Tuscans are in a weak state of affairs, weak enough that Margherita can see a chance to restore her old family titles and inheritances, though she cannot do it militarily. The Aragonese also eye the republic with suspicion and a convincing proposal to the Aragonese could help reinstate her but she is wary, the Aragonese might support her in the long run, but they will not be kind to allow another revolution to happen again, maybe even at her own consequence.\n\nPerhaps, she should simply contact the Tuscan government, and see what they themselves, have to say to her claim....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT4.D;With the chaos of Tuscany's fall, has bought an opportunity it seems. Margherita, the Duchess of Lucca, has bought a proposal of an alliance. Her claims and inheritances of her Valois-Medici give her by right the title of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nShe offers little except her restoration however, and though that should be cause for a denial, it comes with great interest. The Lucca military and administrators will be too small to handle the occupation required for such a rebellious duchy, and so, she will have no choice but to rely on our continued assistance to maintain it. By accepting this and re-instating her, we could begin an informal occupation of the very Duchess's politics. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT5.A;To war it is then! For Margherita! For the Valois-Medici!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT6.T;Aragon Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT6.D;It seems the Aragonese have other plans for Tuscany, as they have rejected any plans for an invasion for the reinstatement of Margherita onto the Tuscan throne. Lucca has been forgotten in the schemes of Italy\n\nThis has caused an instant, drastic effect on Margherita, if anything due to her total cancellations of various tours around Lucca, or even meetings with local mayors or the populace with months-ahead preparations.\n\nOne mayor from Lunata who saw the whole state of affairs put it quite simply..\n\n'I guess the whole country must come to a stop, until the Duchess can finish her tantrum';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT6.A;Lucca has been forgotten in the schemes of Italy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT7.T;The Valois-Medici Contact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT7.D;Margherita, the Duchess of Lucca has seen fit to contact us, and open a dialogue about her claim to the Tuscan Duchy, all made stranger by her almost invitational wish to take the throne.\n\nOf course, nobody can deny that Margherita is honest, being a Valois-Medici, the throne is hers by right. But to simply give it to her would without a doubt, give rise to another revolution almost immediately.\n\nVarious figures from all deliberating parties have vehemently agreed that Margherita is a unifying character for Tuscany, but we cannot compromise on our principles, if she is to come here peacefully, then she must accept that a constitution of rights for the Tuscan people, and her power curtailed.\n\nAlthough, some figures do believe that even accepting Margherita is a compromise on our principles, and that no monarch should ever rule over Tuscany again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT7.A;A restrained monarch, is better then an invading one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT7.B;No monarch will ever touch the Tuscan nation again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT8.T;A Royal Charter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT8.D;It seems the call for dialogue has at least given some fruit to Margherita's cause. Albeit, not perhaps the most wanted. Although Tuscany have shown a willingness for the instatement of Margherita, they call for a series of strict guarantees and an official charter against any concept of absolutist power from Margherita, alongside full amnesty to all revolutionaries.\n\nThough this should have been expected, as their was very little potential of any immediate instatement, the deal gave Margherita pause. After all, if she could gain power in Tuscany free from Aragonese influence, then Valois-Medici power is uncompromised against them.\n\nBut still, accepting the proposition is a reduction of her power regardless, and why should she have to accept the chains of peasantry and local yoke? She still had the Aragonese to count on for her birth right after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT8.A;For the prosperity of all, Margherita accepts the conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT8.B;Margherita will not accept such conditions! She contacts the Aragonese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT9.T;Margherita, Grand-Duchess of Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT9.D;Today, Margherita was accepted into the city of Florence in her carriage, swamped by a silent crowd on her procession up to the former royal residence. In which various members of the Tuscan government awaited her.\n\nThe ceremony was by no means one of grandeur, as the government awaited on the steps with the charter and amnesty opened on their signing papers, to which she was walked up the steps of the residence by her royal guards. In full view of the crowd, she went through the business of signing each document and charter in an almost silent manner. By the last page, and a last stroke of a pen, Margherita was finally presented with the crown of Tuscany, to which she found a helping hand by the catholic priest of Florence, who upon laying it upon her head with full ascension of rights.\n\nThe crowd's silence persisted for few more seconds, before finally, a small applause broke out amongst it, before a rapturous cheering began just seconds afterwards, a fervour of applause for their monarch, upon the chains were voluntary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT9.A;Three Cheers for the Beloved Duchess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT10.T;Tuscany refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT10.D;The call for dialogue had seen little effort it seems, although it looked like they were willing to compromise in the earlier stages, a smaller, more fervent anti-monarchist argument quickly took over the dialogue with a quick rejection of any instatement of Margherita.\n\nMargherita, albeit disappointed, has seemingly realized that we have no real choice but to contact the Aragonese, without additional military and administrative support, it seems the Valois-Medici instatement will come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT10.A;And so she sends her envoy to Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT11.T;The not so Grand Duchess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT11.D;Margherita's call for Aragonese support seemed perfect for her instatement. With the Tuscan republican forces shattered, and the formal declaration of victory by herself and her allies. She was quickly faced with the reality.\n\nTuscany was unlike Lucca, the administration was too large and bureaucratic, something that Lucca lacked, so she required help from Aragonese administrators. Various republican militia's dominated the countryside, so Aragonese forces were required to maintain countryside patrols and garrisons.\n\nEventually, the very cabinet of her government was made up of Aragonese loyalists, every corner of Florence's governmental buildings, Neapolitan or Catalan was whispered behind the backs of Tuscans.\n\nIt was only upon an edict of garrison permanence, in which her full cabinet voted in approval for Aragonese volunteering troops to take up Florence's city guard, that Margherita finally realized that this was not her victory. It was Aragon's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT11.A;A Forceful pair of chains are locked upon Tuscany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT12.T;Our Chained Duchess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT12.D;Our move against Margherita has been a success!\n\nAs we expected, Margherita was intelligent enough to recognize her administrations short comings for Tuscany, and requested our assistance. This turned from administrators, to soldiers rather quickly with the militia's of the countryside causing widespread damage.\n\nBy the time she realized she was cornered, our agents controlled every part of her life and government. She now sits quite sullen upon the throne, after all, it was what she wanted.\n\nBut for us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Demonstrations have begun anew, criticizing the price of bread and the restriction of liberties. Vittorio Filiberto has grown rather agitated and has decided to head toward the castle of Rivoli in the countryside for the time being, fearful of violent anarchists and atheists reported by the police as rather active for the past few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT15.T;An opportunity in Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT15.D; A number of our more hawkish generals and advisors have come forward to propose a daring plan. With the ongoing political turmoil in Piedmont we should lay claim to the province of Savoy, an important strategic lynchpin between us, the Anglois and the Italian states. Some other advisors have pushed against the proposal, citing the already precarious diplomatic framework of Europe. It has been advised that if we were to make a move, that we should not do so without any justification as the international community may react poorly to a surprise invasion. We must therefore first make our intention clear and demand the province from Piedmont.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT16.T;The Burgundian ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT16.D; Horrifying news have reached the political and financial halls of power of the Piedmontese state. The situation regarding Savoy has escalated greatly.It appears that Burgundy has begun to mobilise its standing army in the south of their nation, all the while sending us an ultimatum to back down or face imminent invasion. We must make a choice with how to proceed and neither option is optimal for our state affairs. Either we give in to the overwhelming pressure, risking potentially forever losing a core Italian claim and upsetting the nationalists. Or we risk facing the might of the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT16.A;Our republic is too fragile to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT16.B;We have refused Anglois masters, we will not bow down before Burgundians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT17.D; Stupendous news from Italy! Our seasoned diplomatic mission has today returned from it's important visit to the Piedmontese. They seem to have been a great credit to our state, as the Piedmont state officials quickly acquiesced to the demands of our government. The province of Savoy is now in our hands and we have firmly inserted ourselves in Italian affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT17.A;Three hurras for Burgundian diplomacy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT18.T;The coup is defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT18.D; The Piedmontese monarchy survived a serious attempt to eradicate it from existence today. Liberal and nationalist forces had been able to infiltrate the royal guard and pay off a number of its members to help in what was planned to be a bloodless coup. However, nothing went according to plan. The traitorous guards were quickly rooted out and questioned by the other members of the extensive security detail. It was not long before the first arrests and subsequent near mass exodus of political opponents occurred. With them we have lost important economic potential, but also secured the stability of our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

These however were political refugees and this quickly became apparent. Their revolutionary activity started almost as instantly as they crossed into Genoese territory, finally culminating in the subversion of established institutions and the overthrow of the Duchy. In its place a new republic has been proclaimed, one that promises great political freedoms and the ideals of Italian unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT25.T;Protests in Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT25.D;Revolutionary sentiments have begun to appear more loudly in the capital of the duchy lately : students even dared demand the end of censorship and free elections near the Ducal Palace before the police hastily dispersed them. Duke Leopoldo, now weakening in his old age was approached by his daughter-in-law Maria Borgia alongside her husband Massimiliano. She exposed that Italy had been weakened by the Reaction against Etruria, which cut the ties between the rising bourgeoisie and the monarchies. In this new age of industry, Milan could only survive and thrive by granting a charter that would neuter the Liberal menace and allow Lombardy to rise and realize the Risorgimento. She thus demanded the abdication of the duke securing a swift succession that could realize this idea and later fight for the rights of Maria to Southern Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT25.B;The times are changing, and so does the monarchy …;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT26.D;The meeting between the Duke and his heirs didn’t end the way Maria and Massimiliano hoped. Forced to acknowledge that the Duke wouldn’t agree to their plans, they left the Sforza palace and headed toward their palace in Legnano. But seeing the ducal carriage, a Republican worker, called Maria Buonarotti, who had escaped the repression of the demonstrations thought that the Duke was inside and fired. While Maria Borgia was left unscathed, her husband bled to death in the minutes that followed. Maria Buonarotti escaped and was not caught by the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The feelings of religion with which we are imbued led us to clemency. But our peoples claim from our justice the vengeance of a monstrous crime.’ \n\n Following the murder of the prince of Legnano by a Republican sympathizer, the Ducal guard was granted free reign to find the murderer of the Prince. Informed she was hidden in a building of the Via Rugabella, a regiment cleared out the building room by room, killing men, women and children before finding Buonarotti that prefered to die her weapon at hand than after a trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT28.T;Proclamation of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT28.D;The Rugabella street massacre unified all the various opponents to the Duke : the Army had massacred nearly a hundred persons to find one woman. Bolstered by the new doctrine of the Duke that meant that sooner or later they would become criminals for their Liberal ideas, revolutionaries took to the streets. Regiments soon joined them and the Gonzagas were forced to leave Milan for Mantua, their old family seat. Now the Transpadan republic is proclaimed, but how long can it remain when the Duke still reigns in Mantua ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The old seat of Mantua has opened his doors to the Duke and his old ally Giulano Visconti has joined him to lead the Ducal armies. The Gonzaga flag is being hailed all around the countryside and conscripts are ready to fight the atheist republicans in Milan at the behest of their rightful sovereign. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT40.T;A Milanese proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT40.D;The Savoy valleys and Bresse have been coveted by the Dukes and Kings of Burgundy since the inception of our state but the house of Savoy always maneuvered between our enemies to hold onto these lands. However, the Milanese have contacted us to mediate between them and Paris : should we force the Dual-Monarchy to break their alliance and be neutral in the coming war between the Italian dukes, they will give us the Savoie region alongside Valais and Bresse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT40.A;We will maneuver in Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT40.B;Savoy is not worth the risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT41.T;Burgundian threats over Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT41.D;We have long entertained the dukes of Savoy as our prime allies in Italy, especially since the loss of the duchy of Milan to the Gonzaga of Mantua. However, our hold on the south of France is weak and our capacity to aid the house of Savoy in Italy is tenuous at best. Burgundy has asked us to remove our protection from Savoy and be neutral in the coming war with Milan lest they join Milan directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT41.A;We must back down from Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT41.B;They are our pupp… I mean ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT42.T;The Dual-Monarchy accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT42.D;Thanks to our maneuvering, and a few threats, the Dual-Monarchy has been convinced to break their alliance with the House of Savoy. With this we have fulfilled our part of the deal with Milan. All that remains is for Milan to win their war with Savoy, and afterwards they should give us the regions they promised. Granted should Savoy win this war we will gain nothing, however this wedge we've thrown between Savoy and the Dual-Monarchy will at least cost the Dual-Monarchy a friend in the region for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT42.A;Hurray for ‘diplomacy’;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT43.T;A war is coming;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT43.D;Burgundy has maneuvered at the behest of Milan to have the Dual-Monarchy break their alliance with us and remove their protection. It seems that the Milanese intend to fight us for the supremacy over the North of Italy and that we are alone to face them. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT43.A;We don’t need Paris to win against the Milanese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT44.T;The North Italian Brothers' War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT44.D;Tensions between the house of Savoy and the Gonzagas have been high since the XVIIIth century, each house claiming to be the natural unifier of the North of Italy. Now that the Italian Turnoil has brought forward the idea of a united Italy, there can be only one King to lead the future of Italy. Lombard agents have conspired with Burgundy to obtain the neutrality of the Dual-Monarchy in the coming conflict. With their alliance with Paris broken the house of Savoy must face alone the Lombard troops, and whoever wins will become the champion of the Italian nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT44.A;Avanti Italia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT45.T;Paris supports Turin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT45.D;Despite our maneuvers, the Dual-Monarchy has decided to continue to support Savoy in the event of a war with Milan. With Paris’s support for Savoy, Milan will have to discard their current war plans with Savoy. Even if by some miracle Milan does triumph in a future war with Savoy, they will be under no obligation to give us Savoie, Valais, and Bresse since we couldn’t secure our end of the deal. However, if we were to ally with Milan with their war plan against Savoy, we can ask for the aforementioned regions as payment for our help. Granted, this will bring us into direct conflict with the Dual-Monarchy, and bring full scale war all over our border.. What shall we tell Milan, are we with them or are we out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT45.A;The potential gains are worth it - we stand with Milan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT45.B;We cannot go to war with the Dual-Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT46.D;We have received word from a Burgundian emissary that in the event of a war between us and Milan, even if Milan is the aggressor, that Burgundy will intervene on the side of Milan. Emboldened by their new Burgundian allies, Milan is expected to declare war on us shortly. Fortunately, the Dual-Monarchy has promised to stand by our side in the eventual war with Milan. While the upcoming war is going to be harder than we thought, we will succeed as the masters of Northern Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT46.A;Let’s see Burgundy contend with our mountains and the Dual Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT47.T;Burgundy will fight with us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT47.D;Unfortunately, Burgundy could not secure the neutrality of the Dual-Monarchy. Luckily however, Burgundy has decided to join us in our war with Savoy, and by extension the Dual-Monarchy. Burgundy has made it clear that once we triumph in this war, we are to transfer the territories we originally promised to them. With our alliance secured we will now begin the war against Savoy and establish ourselves as the leaders of Northern Italy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT47.A;And so begins The North Italian Brothers' War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT48.T;Burgundy rejects our proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
ITT48.D;Burgundy, for whatever reason, has decided to reject our proposal. We will have to discard our war plans as any invasion into the Duchy of Savoy is doomed to fail due to Paris’s firm support. Our plans for control over Northern Italy will also have to be put on hold for the foreseeable future. Perhaps the Duke of Savoy can unilaterally, and independently of Paris, start this war we desire, but until then all we can do is wait ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT48.A;Curse you Burgundy, our plans have gone up in smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT49.D;Savoy has been defeated and we must admit that we couldn’t have done it without Burgundy’s help. As per our deal with Burgundy we are obligated to hand over the Alpine portions of the former Savoard territory to them. However, should we really hand over rightful Italian land to another power? We could try to renege on our proposal, but that will absolutely bring us to war with Burgundy. While the mountains do offer a great defensive position, it is uncertain if our tired army can resist an invasion by Burgundy. The choice is ours, shall we honor our deal? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT49.A;A deal is a deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT49.B;No, we don’t think we will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT50.T;Savoie, Valais, and Bresse are ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT50.D;Milan has, naturally, adhered to their part of the deal and has transferred the former  Savoyard Alpine territories to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT50.A;Pleasure doing business with you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT51.T;Millan goes back on our deal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT51.D;Milan has shocked us with the depth of their ingratitude. Despite their promises, and our efforts, Milan will not give us Savoie and the surrounding territories. Milan’s obstinate behavior has left us no choice but to go to war to claim our rightful prize. While this is an outcome we would have liked to avoid, Milan has shown that no amount of diplomacy will make them adhere to the deal that they made with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT52.T;The Bolognese Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT52.D;Romagna was the second center of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of Bologna had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, Romagna was reconquered by the reactionary coalition and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors from the oldest university of Europe. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. But with our brothers in Tuscany having rekindled the flame of liberty, secret societies in Bologna have risen the tricolor and the Papal officials were forced to flee as the revolutionaries decided to join with Etruria. Among them Fabrizio Verdi, head of the Carbonari in Romagna has decided to go further, rallying his men for a March on Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT52.A;For a united Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT53.T;Romagna rejoins the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT53.D;Our success in Italy and our support for revolutionaries has rekindled the revolutionary fervor in Romagna. From the Liberal bastion of Bologna, where many of our leaders have been formed, the Patriots rose against the Papal garrison and its agents who were then thrown out. As planned during the Council of Firenze, the Bologna assembly voted unanimously to join back Etruria in order to advance the National and Revolutionary cause. With our support, the revolutionaries in Romagna have also began their march toward the rest of the Papal states, and hopefully the Eternal City. §RAlready harsh reactions have come from Rome and Barcelona and it may be wise for our armies to be on the watch§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT54.T;The fall of Ancona;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT54.D; “I offer neither pay, nor quarters, nor food; I offer only hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles and death. Let him who loves his country with his heart, and not merely with his lips, follow me.” Fabrizio Verdi \n\n The Papal legate of Romagna, a region where the Inquisition was deeply needed because of the students tendency to join the revolutionary hydra, has been expelled from Bologna. he fled to Ancona on his road to Rome but was seized by the revolutionary leader Fabrizio Verdi who has declared on the main square of the city that he would not cease before the tricolor was hoisted on the Capitol hill. He has attracted bands of former prisoners, deviants and other revolutionary kinds and all the attempts of our forces to seize him have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT54.A;We should not worry, the Papal army will deal with his kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT55.T;The fall of Perugia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT55.D;”If these hands, used to fighting, are unacceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of the Republic who deserves so well of the fatherland.” - Fabrizio Verdi \n\n Horror has swept the Curia as the news of the fall of Perugia has arrived to the Holy City! Fabrizio Verdi, traveling through the Abruzzo mountains has sneaked upon the regiment sent to restore order to Ancona. The commander killed, it seems most of the soldiers decided to join the revolutionary band, allowing them to enter Perugia without a gun fired. There, Verdi solemnly declared the lands of the Patrimony of Saint Peter now part of the ‘Italian republic of Etruria’. Stupor has struck the cardinals who urge the Pope to either take asylum in Aragonese lands or at least mount an organized defense against the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT55.A;I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT56.T;End of the March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT56.D;After leaving our hastily grouped administrators taking control of the Abruzzo, Fabrizio Verdi continued his March on Rome, gathering his partisans to take the Eternal City in the name of the Italian cause. Alas, the Pope had learned from his mistakes in the Abruzzo, and the Papal guard alongside the rest of the army decimated the partisans of Verdi when they tried to assault the city by the Pia gate. Verdi himself lies dead, and the Pope has condemned the Etrurian aggression on his territory. Already the Papal legate in Barcelona has demanded the help of Aragon against us and it is only a matter of days before their troops and ships begin to fight us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT56.A;A worthy sacrifice for the fatherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT57.T;The Italian Revolutionary War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT57.D;The efforts of the Etrurian revolutionaries have born fruit again : thanks to their propaganda endeavours, their support of revolutionary cells and the training of lost young men, most of Central Italy belongs to the Etrurian Republic. An attack of partisans on Rome has however failed, and the Pope has asked for the support of the King of Aragon against the Republic. The Crown has answered the call, and Revolution and Reaction clash once again in Italy. One cry is shouted by the revolutionaries : ‘we make Italy or we die’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT60.D;“The word 'Italy' is a geographical expression, a description which is useful shorthand, but has none of the political significance the efforts of the revolutionary ideologues try to put on it, and which is full of dangers for the very existence of the states which make up the peninsula.” Josep Serna, King of Aragon \n\n The war in Italy has seen the victory of the Aragonese crown who has managed to end once and for all the Etrurian Republic. All around the peninsula, the Liberal leaders are arrested and tried for their crimes while the various sovereigns of the Italian duchies have been installed by Aragonese soldiers on their thrones. First among them, Margerita de Valois-Medici, who has been escorted by Aragonese soldiers to be crowned grand-duchess of Tuscany as to erase the Etrurian stain from the region. The Pope has thanked the Crown for his actions with the cession of his lands in the Abruzzo and Romagna, and once again the Aragonese hegemony reigns over the peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT61.D;”Citizens, men and women of Italy, the freedom of your fatherland is the reward for the blood shed against the Aragonese.

ITT62.D;After leaving our hastily grouped administrators taking control of the Abruzzo, Fabrizio Verdi continued his March on Rome, gathering his partisans to take the Eternal City in the name of the Italian cause.In a stunning victory, he entered the city, forcing the Pope to flee abroad. He has then by popular acclamation proclaimed the unification of Rome within the Etrurian Republic, hoisting the tricolor flag from the top of the Capitol hill. While many have rejoiced, even wept at the sight of our colors in Rome, we now face the Aragonese threat directly and with more vigor than ever. It is only a matter of days before their troops and ships begin to fight us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT63.D;The efforts of the Etrurian revolutionaries have born fruit again : thanks to their propaganda endeavors, their support of revolutionary cells and the training of lost young men, the whole former lands of Saint Peter now belong to the Etrurian Republic. An attack of partisans on Rome has successively taken Romagna, the Abruzzo and now Rome, with the Pope having fled abroad to Benevento, asking for the support of the King of Aragon against the Republic. The Crown has answered the call, and Revolution and Reaction clash once again in Italy. One cry is shouted by the revolutionaries : ‘we make Italy or we die’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ITT65.D;Since the proclamation of the so-called Borgia charter by the Duke and Duchess of Milan, Borgists have gathered throughout Italy The South has heard the call of her rightful sovereign as crowds gather to be armed and fight the Aragonese throughout the Kingdom of Naples. Between our current possessions and the South lie the prize of Italy, Rome still governed by the Church. The Pope has refused to grant us access, stating that Maria had no rights to Naples since her abdication. We have no choice but to declare war on the Papal State to make sure that the Marianists are not isolated in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT66.T; A Sign of Loyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ITT66.D;In our continued quest to deepen the power base of Borgia family by reducing Aragonese influence in the Italian peninsula, and coopting the Italian unification cause, there has been a significant development. Nationalists and independence rebels in our Aragonese holdings in Naples have been successful in expelling the local garrison and overthrowing the civil administration. They have of course pledged their loyalty to our ongoing cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Today however the extreme measures of the Gonzagas-Borgia family have outright shocked all those not immediately aware of what was planned.

PAPAL1.T;The Papal Standoff;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL1.D;The Holy Father has never hidden his contempt for Italian republicanism. That it has prevailed is regarded by many within the Church, himself foremost, as both a living blasphemy and a personal insult. The Pope has not gone so far as to declare himself a “prisoner” of $COUNTRY$, as some ultramontanists advocate - at least, not yet. However, the Catholic Church is now openly encouraging resistance to the government, and the Pope has made public statements effectively declaring our republic to be illegitimate. While the Holy Father has not backed any specific monarchist pretender to the throne, it is clear that the Church has become implacably hostile. We must resolve this situation to end the threat of a reactionary uprising fueled by Catholic agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL1.A;The tradition of dead generations weigh like nightmares on the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL2.T;The Papal Standoff;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL2.D;Our attack upon the Stato Pontificio in order to support the Neapolitan rebels outraged His Holiness, and our victory has done anything but mollify him. While he has not made any attempts at insurrection, the Holy Father has appointed only the most vitriolically anti-Borgia priests to any available position across Italy. The result has been the entire Church slowly morphing into a vehicle for opposition to our government. Needless to say, this is wreaking havoc upon our administration, to say nothing of its effect on public opinion. We must resolve this situation to end the threat of an uprising fueled by Papal agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL2.A;Old habits die hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL20.T;The Papal Standoff;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL20.D;The Pope has led Italian resistance to Valois expansion into Italy for centuries. While we have finally asserted our right to the Iron Crown, the Holy Father’s contempt for our dynasty has reached unprecedented heights. Now he has not only refused to lift our excommunication, but has appointed only the most vitriolically anti-Valois priests to any available position across Italy. The result has been the entire Church slowly morphing into a vehicle for opposition to our government. Needless to say, this is wreaking havoc upon our administration, to say nothing of its effect on public opinion. We must resolve this situation to end the threat of an uprising fueled by Papal agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL20.A;Old habits die hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL3.T;The Prisoner in the Vatican;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL3.D;Our government was unable to reach an agreement with His Holiness the Pope regarding the Pope’s traditional lands in Rome prior to our annexation of the Stato Pontificio. Now he has begun to refer to himself as a “prisoner” of Italy! The Pope has canceled all foreign appearances and is now refusing to leave the Vatican, so as to avoid recognizing our government’s authority over any part of Italy. Rumors are swirling that the Pope will even refuse his traditional appearance in Saint Peter’s Square for Easter Mass, an event of great significance and one attended by Catholic pilgrims from across the world. We must address this situation if we want the Catholic Church to be more than a thorn in our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL3.A;How melodramatic of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL4.T;The Papal Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL4.D;The ramifications of Italian nationalists’ concessions to the Papacy are only now beginning to be felt. With the education system and the taxation service both under Church influence, the nation’s values are drifting towards effective theocracy. Main Italian liberals are growing bitter at the amount of power which the Pope has managed to accumulate for himself and his Church. Those who saw the great struggles of the late eighteenth century as a righteous war upon the Altes Regime and the ways of old fear that those struggles, at least in Italy, may have been in vain. On the other hand, those on the right feel that Italy is finally in the control of righteous and pious leadership, and have implored those on the left to accept the new order for the sake of Italian unity. One thing is clear : no matter who allegedly governs Italy, true authority lies in the Vatican.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL4.A;”But what profit is it to gain the world but lose your soul?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL5.T;The Elephant in Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL5.D;After hours of spirited debate within the executive cabinet, it has been decided that we must attempt negotiation with the Pope to resolve our political impasse with the Church. Despite the Holy Father’s grievances with our government, we are still a monarchy, and thus far more legitimate in the Church’s eyes than a republic. Many ministers have supported a proposal which would allow the Pope to retain the lands within the Leonine Walls as a city-state if he surrenders his claims to the rest of the former Stato Pontificio. At the very least we must show the Catholics of Italy and the world that we are capable of being reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL5.A;Surely he will recognize reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL6.T;The Pope Agrees to New Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL6.D;The Holy Father seems to have realized that we will not give in to his demands solely by virtue of his protests. This morning the Papal legate informed us that His Holiness is ready to begin a new round of negotiations with our administration. Before we can proceed, we must determine how and where these negotiations will be held. In the meantime it has been decided to allow news of the agreement to leak to the press without a formal government announcement. This will allow us to maintain the pretense of discretion, while also reassuring Italian conservatives that we are acting in good faith towards the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL6.A;Such a tangled web we weave…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL7.T;The Problem of the Catholic Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL7.D;We can no longer avoid the issue of the Catholic Church’s hostility to our government, and by extension the hostility of the Pope. The fact of the matter is that many Italians are Catholics and the political struggle between the main civil and religious institutions of the nation are wrenching Italian society apart. While multiple members of the executive cabinet have called for a direct assault upon the Church’s political power and influence, it has been decided that this extreme course of action should not be our first resort. Instead we have reached out to the Pope via the Papal legate, proposing a series of negotiations to establish the future of the Vatican within the context of the Italian state. Despite the Pope’s disrespect of our government, even he must understand the reality of his situation - or so we hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL7.A;If he does not, we will be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL8.T;Meeting the Legate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL8.D;We have reached out to the Papal legate and after some back and forth we have settled on how the negotiations are to proceed. Negotiations will take place in the Lateran Palace, the former residence of the Pope and while the Pope will not be there in person, a delegation will be present to present his demands and to negotiate with us. The final treaty will then be presented to the Pope and if he finds it adequate we will sign it. While the legate has found these conditions to be satisfactory he admitted that there is no guarantee that the Pope himself will agree to start negotiations. Regardless we will begin setting up everything in the Lateran Palace and hope that we can resolve the Papal Question in a manner that is acceptable to everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL8.A;We will await in the Lateran Palace, we hope the Pope sees reason;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL9.T;The Issue of Papal Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL9.D;The Lateran Negotiations have begun and the first and most pressing issue is the matter of Papal Autonomy. The Papal delegate recognizes that the Papal States will not be returned in full and has instead asked that we recognize Papal rights to the Vatican Hill in Rome and the Palais dei Papas in Avignon. While the Papacy being in Rome makes sense, the Papal claim in Avignon is more tenuous. Papal influence has been in decline in Avignon and we may not even be able to enforce such a claim. Not only that, but accommodating these demands will most likely reduce the productivity of these cities by half. We could accept the Papal delegates' demand, or we could push for a compromise and only give them the Vatican while granting them some control over some of the historic churches in Rome along with some more concessions down the line. We could also flat out reject the demand that the Pope should have any independence. This will most likely doom these negotiations, but it is still an option we could pursue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL9.A;The Pope will get the Vatican, and Avignon, at least in theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL9.B;The Pope will have Vatican and some privileges like the Lateran cathedral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL9.C;The Pope must abandon ideas of sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL10.T;Restitution to the Church?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL10.D;The Church has brought forth another demand during the negotiations at Lateran. They demand restitution for the seizure of Papal land that occurred during the creation of the Italian state. The sum they demand is, to be frank, ludicrous, and there is no way we can be expected to pay it. However, in order to try and satiate the Papal delegation, a compromise plan has been formed. The Catholic Church will receive an annual stipend of money from the Italian government. This stipend will come from a special tax on the people at a rate of 0.8 percent of their annual income. While this tax will negatively affect our own income and the living standards of our people it is the best worst idea we have to try and meet the Church halfway. Should we propose our compromise to the delegates?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL10.A;Eight per thousand tax is best we can propose;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL10.B;The Church is rich enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL100.T;The Matter of Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL100.D;With the Lateran Negotiations wrapping up the Papal delegates have finally brought forth the final expected issue. The Church feels that the education system of Italy is promoting heretical beliefs and is turning people away from God’s light. To this end the delegates have demanded that we reform our education system and mandate Catholic lessons into our curriculum. This includes bringing priests into schools to teach classes, mandatory Bible reading, and the suppression of any topics the Church finds disagreeable. Effectively, this would turn all our schools into Catholic schools. Some members of our government feel that this is a ploy to indoctrinate our youth and, while it will most likely help with literacy in our lands, it is very possible that it will damage our research capabilities. Unfortunately, we don’t have time to debate on this topic and the success of the negotiations may rest on this decision. We must either accept this demand in full or reject it outright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL100.A;Accept, at least our people will be able to read better;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL100.B;The Church has no business controlling our school system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL11.T;The Lateran Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL11.D;After many hours of debates and compromises we have finally reached an agreement with the Pope. The Catholic Church will recognize the legitimacy of our government, and in return we will follow the stipulations decided during our negotiations. The Lateran treaty has already been signed by both parties, and with this, the Papal Question has finally been put to rest. We can only hope that this will mark the end of Catholic agitation against the Italian government, and the beginning of a new era of unity. The Pope himself is more than satisfied with the results : at a recent address held at a Catholic university in Firenze, the Holy Father declared that the Church and the government together have...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL11.A;”...restored God to Italy and Italy to God.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL12.T;The Negotiations Fail ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL12.D;Negotiations between us and the Papal delegates were tense. The Church representatives repeatedly accused us of acting in bad faith and not taking their proposals seriously, despite our protests that they were placing unjust demands upon Italian sovereignty. This finally came to a climax today, as the Papal delegates walked out of the Lateran Palace, declaring the negotiations a farce that only sought the submission of the Church. Any chance of resolving the Papal question peacefully has been dashed, and now our only option is to try and break the power of the Church by whatever means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL12.A;Perhaps peace was never an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL13.T;The Fight Against the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL13.D;Our attempt to reach a negotiated settlement with the Pope has failed and it seems apparent that there is no way to reconcile the Church with the State. Our only option now is to try and destroy the influence the Church holds over our people. This is going to be a long fight, but first we must consider what we can utilize with our war against the Church before we begin our campaign in full force. It is not necessary to wipe out Catholicism within Italy, nor is such a thing feasible. What we need now is to purge the Church from all civil institutions, and prevent it from ever creeping back in again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL13.A;We will correct Pepin’s error.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL14.T;Pardon the Republicans of Etruria?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL14.D;One of the defining aspects of the Etrurian Revolution was its aggressive secular policies against the Catholic Church. Now that we find ourselves against the Church, we find ourselves emulating the Etrurian model of secularization to remove the influence of the Church from civil society. We could go a step further and pardon the republicans of Etruria, who were the first to advocate secularization, and bring them into our campaign. While these men would no doubt be of great value against the Church, the republicans have also made it clear that they do not support the monarchy and may only create more problems if we were to release them. Should we gamble and give the republicans amnesty or go with our secularization policy alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL14.A;Pardon the republicans, we share a common foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL14.B;No, the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL15.T;Should we Secularize the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL15.D;Catholicism is the dominant religion in Italy which makes fighting the Catholic Church a herculean effort. Since Catholicism is effectively one and the same as the Church, one proposal for removing the power of the Church is the secularization of the nation. Secularism in Italy is far from a new idea - Article 1 of the revolutionary Etrurian constitution explicitly forbade religious involvement in government affairs. Now it has been proposed to adopt an amendment to our own constitution to officially separate Church and State. This would remove all aspects of religion from our government and devastate the Church’s hold over us and our people. However, such an overt resurrection of the Etrurian secularist ideology would infuriate many Italians. We could focus on smaller reductions of Church influence in government institutions but nothing would be swifter than an outright ban.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL15.A;The Church and State must be separate at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL15.B;We must use more subtle methods to undermine the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL16.T;The End of Catholic Influence in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL16.D;The revolution has triumphed! At long last, the old bourgeois order has been smashed to pieces by the power of the proletariat. No symbol of reactionary dominance is more omnipresent, or more hated, in Italy than that of the Catholic Church. For well over a thousand years this den of thieves and slavemasters has bound Italian labor, Italian wealth, and Italian minds in its chains of gold. No longer! The revolutionary council has just passed a measure officially banning all religious institutions from participating in civil society. While outright destruction of Catholicism has failed to win unilateral support from the council, these measures will still do much to end Catholic influence in our schools and our finances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL16.A;May the traditions of dead generations weigh upon us no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL17.T;The Second Lateran Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL17.D;The end of socialist rule in Italy has necessitated a review of previous agreements made with the Catholic Church. These agreements, collectively known as the Lateran Treaty, awarded considerable autonomy and privileges to the Church in exchange for its recognition and support of the Italian government. The first treaty was annulled by the previous regime, but now we have faced overwhelming pressure from both Catholic clergy and lay believers to renew it. In the interest of stabilizing our government, a second treaty has been signed in the refurbished Lateran Palace, which reiterates nearly all of the terms of the prior agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL17.A;We may need to review this once again in the future…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL18.T;Vatican Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL18.D;The Lateran Treaty included provisions to allow the Pope and by extension the Catholic Church to control certain territories in Rome located on or around the Vatican Hill. These territories, often referred to simply as “the Vatican,” are the final vestige of the Papal States - and the Church guards its privileges well. Today the Papal legate arrived in $CAPITAL$ to reaffirm the rights of the Church and the autonomy of the Vatican. Papal control over the aforementioned lands have been once again recognized by our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL18.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL19.T;Avignon Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAPAL19.D;The Lateran Treaty included provisions to allow the Pope and by extension the Catholic Church to control certain territories in the County of Avignon-Venaissin. These territories, often referred to simply as “Avignon,” are the one of the last vestiges of the Papal States - and the Church guards its privileges well. Today the Papal legate arrived in $CAPITAL$ to reaffirm the rights of the Church and the autonomy of Avignon.

RUS_normalize_diplomacy_title;Appoint Matvei Goncharov;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
RUS_normalize_diplomacy_desc;Matvei Goncharov is a prominent lawyer and businessman renowned for his charm. Born Matteo Goncharov to a Neapolitan mother and a Novgorodian father, he speaks six languages and has written multiple books on his travels across Europe. Goncharov, dismayed that foreign views of Russia remain so clouded by ignorance, has recently published an essay arguing that Russia must adopt a broad reform of its diplomatic corps. These include opening academies for foreign service officers, requiring that all personnel demonstrate adequate knowledge of their host country, including fluency in its language, and for state funding of Russian arts and cultural programs abroad, especially for music and theater. There is perhaps no man in Russia more qualified to be our foreign minister. Goncharov's charisma and insight, along with his reforms, will pave the way for an international improvement of Russia's reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

rock_and_hard_place;The Endless Troubles;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rock_and_hard_place_desc;Russia has tried to unite several times, and all attempts have failed. A continued conspiracy between the king in Warsaw and the king in Copenhagen have kept the Russians weak and in a permanent state of near anarchy. However, as both states are doomed to suffer this century: it might finally be possible to unite the scattered Russian Princes and finally create Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MOS_anarchy;The Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

MUS_enemies_all_sides_desc;With every princedom of Central Russia attempting to unify the region under their name, the Principality of Moscow finds itself right in the middle, doomed to be invaded from all possible sides. Moscow must entrench itself and defend its position at all costs if it has any hope of survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
unstable_confederation;Unstable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
unstable_confederation_desc;The Lands of Novgorod seem large and vast on a map, but that appearance is deceiving at best: Divided by feudal lords and vastly different interest groups, the authority of the city of Veliky Novgorod is limited and restricted by a delicate balance of power, one which should not be overturned without some preparation, lest we want to trigger a rebellion by our vassals...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

little_poland_desc;The institution that once prided itself as the first Russian-language university in all Europe has begun to teach classes exclusively in the Polish language.

No longer shall we rely on Novgorodian protection: we shall be free to act as we please within Russia.

tier_three_northern_expansion_title;Spread The Wings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tier_three_northern_expansion_desc;Those who return from the East speak of incredible opportunities. Solid forests that occupy an area larger than many Russian principalities. Reserves of resources beyond anything we know. And in all this territory, fewer people live than in our capital city. Siberia must become Russian - and no one else's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tier_three_western_expansion_title;Pan-Slavic Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tier_three_western_expansion_desc;For now, Russia has united under its warm wing the Slavic peoples of the Russian Plain, ensuring our kind will continue to flourish. However, we must not stop - the Turks, the Germans, the Italians - they all grind their teeth at the Slavic peoples of the Balkans and Poland, denying their right to statehood and making plans to enslave them. But these plans are not destined to come true! Za Voliu Slavjan - this will be the core of our further policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tier_three_southern_expansion_title;Secure Black Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tier_three_southern_expansion_desc;The laws of Geopolitics, discovered by Pitirim Simavetsky, say that the nation and the state of that nation will expand until they encounter natural obstacles. The seas, mountains, and rivers are all natural shields of our homeland, silently guarding it from foreign invasions. The Carpathian Mountains and buffer states in the west, the Ural Mountains and the Altai Mountains in the east are already defending Russia. The time has come to close the last flank of our defense - once Russia conquered the Caucasus and found allies in the South, it would become the hegemon of the Black Sea and would vociferously consolidate its status as a great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrate_kuban_title;Integrate Kuban;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
integrate_kuban_desc;The Kuban Cossack Host, with help from our administration, has been developing the noble plains between the Don and the Caucasus for years. Through their efforts, these lands can no longer be distinguished from the rest of Russia - well-groomed Cossack stanitsas, new towns and fortresses will make the uninformed visitor to this region believe that this has always been like that. It is time to integrate the Kuban!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romanian_relations_title;Ally Romania;;;;;;;;;;;;;

macedonian_relations_title;Ally Macedonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
macedonian_relations_desc;Although at first we were skeptical of Macedonia, seeing it as just another project of the Crown of Aragon, we cannot deny its strategic importance now. By creating a strong alliance with Macedonia we will ensure our security in the Aegean Sea and advance our plan to protect the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greek_relations_title;Ally Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greek_relations_desc;Greece and Byzantium hold a special place in the Russian heart. From there came our faith (whether Orthodox or Uniate), from there came our culture and political tradition.

the_panslavic_dream_desc;In the first stages of the centralization of Russia, the Commonwealth was our main rival.

prussia_delenda_est_title;The end of Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
prussia_delenda_est_desc;The Duchy of Prussia is another shameful reminder of the times when the Slavic peoples were oppressed and colonized by the German race. By eliminating this entity, we will be able to restore historical justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
serbian_relations_title;Ally Serbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
serbian_relations_desc;For centuries, Serbs have been occupied by Turks and Hungarians. The independence of this brave people gave us another potential ally, and by including Serbia in our axis of influence, we can better protect the interests of Slavic peoples in the Balkans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
illyrian_relations_title;Ally Illyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
illyrian_relations_desc;Although Illyria had other beginnings, we can now say with certainty that it has become the nation-state of the Croats. In spite of the fact that these people are mostly Roman Catholics, they are just as tolerant of foreigners as the Orthodox peoples of the Balkans. By creating an alliance with them, we will strengthen their statehood and gain ourselves another reliable partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bulgarian_relations_title;Ally Bulgaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bulgarian_relations_desc;The Bulgarian state is an important cog in the Black Sea security system. By making them our allies, Russia can directly threaten Constantinople and contain Turkish influence in our area of interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

to_the_ends_of_siberia_desc;It is difficult to count how many Russian people have died in wars with European states over our ethnic lands. In the conquered territories it is necessary to create administrations, to manage the local population. However, to the east, beyond the Urals, lie the vast expanses of Siberia, waiting for their colonizers. We are going East!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eastern_warm_water_port_title;To the Sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eastern_warm_water_port_desc;Our conquest of the East was successful, but not without problems. The logistical difficulties encountered by our troops and colonists seriously hampered the settlement of Siberia. By creating a large port in the east and building a railroad to it, we will ensure better control of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lord_of_the_east_title;Eastern Jewel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lord_of_the_east_desc;The Russian eagle has spread its wings! From the Baltic to the Pacific Ocean, from the Arctic to the sweltering steppes of Central Asia, Russia rules one-sixth of all the land. Our main eastern port will become the main diamond in the crown of our empire, it will become the most modern city in the world, which will surely show other countries - now Asia will be ruled by Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrate_finland_title;Integrate Finalnd;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrate_finland_desc;The Russian poet Mikhail Vlasov called Finland "a country where each of a thousand lakes has its own soul" - and now those souls speak Russian. Now it is difficult to distinguish Finland from the neighboring Russian lands of Novgorod or Bjarmia - Finns accept our culture and way of life without much resistance. The time has come to integrate Finland into Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
secure_central_poland_title;Secure Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
secure_central_poland_desc;One of the glorious chapters in the history of the unification of Russia is our confrontation with Poland. Having defeated another regional leader, we loudly proclaimed our ambitions. However, we should not make the Polish people pay for the mistakes of their kings. By creating Polish autonomy, we will win the loyalty of the Poles and better integrate them into the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_russia_northern_TVE_desc;Following in the footsteps of Feodor II the Great of Yaroslav, the Belsky princedom of Yaroslav has regained its rightful title of Grand Prince of the Rus. With the humiliation of Novgorod, the Belsky Dynasty is now able to grasp the title our predecessors have always longed for: An Imperial crown for the throne of Yaroslavl, a principality which now stands firm as one of the greatest powers to have ever existed in Russian history.

form_russia_northern_NOV_desc;Novgorod was never interested in the Southern Princedoms of Veliky Russia since all that made a difference in the eyes of the Novgorodian elite was within the Lord City of Novgorod. But the past few years have shown the need for Novgorod to change its ways so that it is not swept away by the modern era. Now, as the threat of the Southern princedoms has been vanquished, Novgorod can and certainly will lead the Eastern Slavs to glory and prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_northern_generic_title;The Unification of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_northern_generic_desc;For centuries, Russia was a diffuse geographical location, a threat that had to be suppressed by the Tartars, Poles and Scandinavians, and a dream of intellectuals who renounced reality.

form_russia_southern_title;The Russian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_southern_desc;The history of the Eastern Slavs has been a tragedy since the Mongol invasions and left scars that have yet to be healed. Never has a state gained enough power to rise above the petty rivalries of the numerous princedoms and protect the people from the Tatar intrusions. The unification of the princedoms was merely the beginning. But now, $COUNTRY$ will bring order and justice to the steppe as a new nation will be born on the banks of the Volga and Don which will put an end to the humiliation of All Rus!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_southern_CSK_title;From Ukraine to Russia;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_southern_CSK_desc;The Cossack hosts were the first true Russians : these warbands that fought the Tatars welcomed any Slav who wanted to fight or flee oppression from the boyars. Cossacks formed a new people in Ukraine and it is to us, the strong, that the burden of unifying the Eastern Slavs fall upon now. From the blood shed in the Dyke Pole has arisen the worthy destined to lead Russia and all Slavs to glory!;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_western_title;The Unification of Rossiya;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_western_desc;Many contemptuous historians have said that the various princedoms of Central Russia could never be unified. In the steppe, arrogant Arab and Turkish traders proclaimed that the Tatars and the Cossacks could never be humbled. And in the realm of forests and snow, Scandinavian observers declared that Novgorod could never be tamed. And, yet, here we stand. As these voices perish in jealousy and fear, we stand atop of a new order which could rival the archaic ones of the West in power and might. Let the new and young Russian nation stay united forever and the glory of the Slavs never be doubted again!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now the time has come to bring all of Rosiya under one glorious nation!

Even now they have banded together to establish a union of central Rosiya from which they intend to subjugate all of the Eastern Slavs. This cannot be allowed! It is we who are the inheritors of the Rus’ legacy, and it is we who will bring forth the new Rosiya. Therefore the Velikorussians must submit to our hegemony!

Serving as the lap dogs of Scandinavia has not given ‘Lord Novgorod the Great’ the prosperity and power to block our rightful path for the restoration and unification of the Russian lands. As our holdings in central Russia crystalize, we can finally march north and knock the arrogant merchants of Novgorod off their throne, and take it for ourselves and for all of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

move_capital_RUT_desc;Kyiv is no longer merely the heart of the Rus’ - now she has reclaimed her status as the guiding star of the Eastern Slavs. Such a role requires that the city be remade to fit her newfound splendor, and accommodate the burdens of serving as the capital of the new Russian nation. Architects from across Russia as well as western Europe will be consulted to endow Kyiv with broad boulevards, lush trees, parks, and gardens, and efficient infrastructure. Above all we will seek to imbue Kyiv with a truly Ruthenian architectural style, one which shall spread across Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With our newly found unity, the South appears less threatening each day, and conquering and taming it may bear fruit for our nation. We should expect a struggle with the Cossacks and the khanates, but Russia’s march towards the Black Sea is inevitable, for the land doesn’t belong to Cossacks, Tatars, or Turks, but to holy Russia alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Securing the Caucasus mountains will secure the southern borders of Russia, allow us to project our power unto the near east, and safeguard the Black Sea as a Russian domain.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_northern_plan_RUS_title;The Northern Plan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_northern_plan_RUS_desc;Russia’s future lies within its access to the sea, or at least that is what many within our government claim. The White Sea remains unreliable, as it remains frozen for most of the year. The Baltic Sea, on the other hand, is a far more reliable body of water, which alone could bolster Russian trade and our economy. Unfortunately, another nation covets the sea as its personal domain: Scandinavia. Scandinavia’s chokehold over the Baltic Sea was always a roadblock in the path of Russian prosperity. But now, we possess the strength to seize and control that sea for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_grand_ruthenian_conquest_title;The Grand Ruthenian Conquest;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_grand_ruthenian_conquest_desc;The time to unite the Ruthenian people has come. The Polish crown has occupied Ruthenian lands for almost a millenia, but with our help, this abomination of the polonised Russians will finally meet its end. White, Black, and Red Ruthenia are all integral parts of Russia. And with this conquest, we will finally achieve union with our White Russian brethrens!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_belarus_title;Conquest of Belarus;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_belarus_desc;Belarus, unshackled from Poland, is now free for us to conquer. The people of White Ruthenia perhaps will try to resist our advancement, but only for their ignorance of our shared heritage and their centuries long lives under the Polish boot. Russia will stretch up to Grodno, and our empire will not be stopped, for White Ruthenia is a gateway for the west and our future prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_ukraine_title;Conquest of Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
conquest_of_ukraine_desc;The Ruthenian people of the South are not forgotten in $CAPITAL$. Ukraine’s agricultural importance is not lost on us, and this new Russian holding will help support our Ruthenian kin in the millions. Ukraine’s importance also lies within its access to the Black Sea and the Crimean peninsula, access to sea that our country so desperately needs. Lastly, Ukraine represents a path to the Balkan, another entry to the west that would surely prove beneficial for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_into_red_ruthenia_title;Move into Red Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_into_red_ruthenia_desc;Out of all the Ruthenian people, the Red Ruthenians have been under Polish domination for the longest. They adopted their religion, their culture, and their customs. We will not let this injury go unpunished. Our thrust westwards will include Red Ruthenia, it is still afterwards our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

triumph_in_the_west_desc;Our western conquests have concluded in a complete victory! Our land stretches up to the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains! The Ruthenian people are at last united.

the_cossack_claims_desc;The Cossacks in the south have broken away from our people long ago. But they cannot deny their place as part of Russia and the Ruthenian people! After centuries of lawlessness, we may finally bring law to the rowdy Pontic Steppe and its wild assortment of hordes, hosts and khannates.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
slay_the_turkish_stronghold_title;Slay the Turkish stronghold;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
slay_the_turkish_stronghold_desc;Crimea was a foothold of Turkic menace on the steppes of Russia, and through all these centuries, it escaped the wrath of Ruthenians, Poles and Lithuanians on horseback. In addition, the Crimeans also impose an difficult obstacle on our policymakers: access to the Black Sea. With the Crimean peninsula serving as the khanate’s heartland, it is difficult for our state to truly utilize the Black Sea for our benefit. With the downfall of the Crimeans, Russia will further its goals in the quest for dominance in the South!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  
the_dreams_of_cossacks_title;The dreams of the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_dreams_of_cossacks_desc;The Cossacks have long dreamt of reaching the Caspian sea, riding eastwards and establishing new hosts. Due to over extension this dream has never bore fruit. But it may now, as Russian eastward expansion may allow the Cossacks to move and settle under our administration, forming regional clans in newly conquered areas, and helping to keep order among the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
demolish_cirassia_title;Demolish Circassia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
demolish_cirassia_desc;Circassia stands on the edge of the Caucasus Mountains, one last foe before we reach the magnificent frontier. We cleaved through the Cossacks, Tatars and Turks, the Circassians will not be any different, for Russia’s destiny lays on the snowy mountaintops of the harsh Caucasus Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
triumph_in_the_south_title;Triumph in the South;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_south_desc;The South has been tamed. No hordes, no hosts, and no khanates, only Russia’s might dominate these lands. Both our physical frontier is secured in the mountainous south, as well as our naval backyard on the rocky shores of the Crimean coast. Russia has broken the Turkic grip that held it down for centuries, and has brought security to its periphery.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clean_up_ingria_desc;Without their Scandinavian overlord, the watchdogs of the East have lost their bite. After the untimely departure of Scandinavia, the lands that are indisputably Russian may finally be cleaned up and brought back into their Russian kin. This may also help us secure our much needed claim on the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_title;The Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_desc;Livonia has been in Scandinavian hands for over a millennium, but can they really back their claim to these lands anymore with the minimum control they have over it? As Russia awoke from its millennium long slumber, Livonia is shaken from its flimsy Scandinavian shackles, to be brought into Russia. This territory establishes a true foothold on the Baltic coast, and as such must be acquired by our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_livonian_war_balter_desc;Livonia has been in Scandinavian hands for over a millennium, but can they really back their claim to these lands anymore with the Baltic Germans furious at their current policies? As Russia awoke from its millennium long slumber, Livonia is shaken from its flimsy Scandinavian shackles, to be brought into Russia. This territory establishes a true foothold on the Baltic coast, and as such we must exploit the current instablity in the region so we may conquer it.  §RWe may need to wait a while until this policy causes a inevitable uprising.§!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secure_russian_karelia_title;Secure Russian Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
secure_russian_karelia_desc;Karelia has been strongly tied with Novgorod for centuries, this is obviously well known. It’s current owners, however, have maintained their hold over the region not by their strength, but by our weakness. Such weakness is no longer present, and we will show the northmen that legitimacy can only be earned by the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_scandinavian_folly_title;The Scandinavian folly;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_scandinavian_folly_desc;Scandinavia is effectively an overseas power, and the reason for this is the cold and barren Finland. Finland is the wall Scandinavia cowers behind when it so cowardly threatens Russia. But this wall can be turned against the petty Scandinavians, for with ease we could conquer Finland and establish our own dominion over it, stripping the northmen of their last imperial possession in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
triumph_in_the_north_title;Triumph in the North;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_north_desc;Scandinavia has been dismantled, and has limped away across the Baltic Sea to their frigid home. Now the Baltics, Karelia, and Finland are under Russian authority, as we went from holding a barely functional White Sea port, to the grand Baltic shore. From the Gulf of Finland to the gulf of Riga, we may now enjoy the prosperity of Baltic trade. But our victories don’t end there, with Baltic trade comes access to the West, as the only thing that separates our state from the ones of Central and Western Europe’s is a short boat trip. With the conquest of the North comes the embrace of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_sibir_title;Integrate Sibir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_sibir_desc;Sibir has stared at us across Siberia for centuries, out of our reach. Now we leaped across Eurasia, establishing footholds all over Siberia. The Khanate of Sibir is one of our footholds in the region, influenced by cunning diplomacy and our economic power. Now we may use that leverage to establish a protectorate over the khanate and integrate it into the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_kazan_title;Integrate Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_kazan_desc;Kazan has been an awkward interloper in Russian affairs, exploiting our division to pillage and enslave our people. Kazan’s presence has slowly shrunk over the years as Russia has coalesced into a powerful nation, and now poses no threat to our security. But Russian interests in the region demand action, Kazan is still in our way eastwards, and its rivers will prove useful for our economy. Now that Kazan has been declawed, we may be able to force it into our empire diplomatically, turning it into a mere protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_bashkir_title;Integrate Bashkir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_bashkir_desc;Bashkir lays in the middle of the Ural Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Aral Sea. A symbolic gateway eastwards, wherefrom we may not only ride eastwards, but also southwards to the lands of Persia and India. Like the rest of the petty khanates, economic and military pressure might prove to be an easier solution to direct military action, for we have gone a long way since the Russian nation has exploded outwards from its Slavic heartlands.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_final_play_desc;The Tatars are boxed in, they cower in the East across the Volga, never could they have imagined a time where the Slavic people will rise to threaten them. With this, we will establish the borders for our future governorate in the region, preemptively cutting Tatar lands to shreds and establishing an administration for our governorate in the region. The days of the marauders are short...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_tatar_checkmate_BAH_NOV_desc;The Yugrian Confederation always had ambitions of taming the Bashkiri throughout the years.

accept_ruthenian_cultures_desc;Centuries of separation stands before us and the Ruthenians, centuries of Polish and Lithuanian occupation and subjugation.

accept_north_tatar_cultures_desc;We don’t love the Tatars of the East, that much is known both to them and to us. But as our empire extends in all directions, we must come to terms with reality: cooperation and compromise is sometimes necessary for our empire’s existence.

move_capital_TVE_desc;The new Russian tsardom has secured its hold over Eastern Europe and gained access to the Baltic. While Tver, Yaroslavl and Vladimir are all important cities, the Tsar and the nation need a new capital city to show to the world the wonders Russia is capable of. Out of the swamps of the Neva in Nyenschantz, we will use the tremendous workforce of the freed serfs to build Belskaya, where soon our Belsky rulers will sit and decide the fate of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

move_capital_MUS_desc;Moscow could have been an early centre for Russia, as the Princes of Moscow nearly unified Russia in the 15th century.

move_capital_RYA_title;Alexandria on the Don;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_RYA_desc;The port of Tanais has become a summer residence for many boyars along with members of the imperial family thanks to its proximity to the Black Sea. For many years the imperial government has entertained the idea of building a new Russian capital here, easily accessible to the sea and thus to international trade while symbolizing the new might of the Slavs over the Tatars. Let the old port transform itself into a city worthy of the old 'Gunpowder Prince' Alexander Repnin, Alexandrovsk!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_NZH_title;Volga Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_NZH_desc;The Volga river is the main artery of trade and wealth in the new Russia, which has been born thanks to the opening of Tatar lands to colonization. The old city of Saraj was built on a strategic path, where the Don and Volga river get close enough to build a canal. Our government plans that around this vital canal a city would be built that will outshine the mosques and bazaars from the old Tatar 'city' and serve as the rightful capital of the nation!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_NOV_title;Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_NOV_desc;What other city could outshine Novgorod in Russia and serve as its capital? None. But as proud as everyone is of the oldest city of the East, it is admitted that the lack of urban planning and the uncertainties of the past years have led to a demand for renewed urban works. With this, the capital of Russia can shine and be recognized internationally as the greatest city of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_SMO_title;Our heritage;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_SMO_desc;Kiev was the capital of the first state of Rus' and is thus the natural choice of capital for our Slavic union, but at the same time the city has seen better days. The Polish treated it as the last city before the frontier and generally left no trace of their passage outside of the Catholic churches. We will rebuild it as a vibrant and mighty city like in the times of the Princes of Kiev, with an important focus on the Palace of the People that will host the Slavic Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_CSK_title;The Eastern Capital;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_CSK_desc;Kharkov has served as the natural seat of government for the unified hosts thanks to its central location in Ukraine. But as our state grows in the East the need for a new capital has become more pressing. Many call for the old city of Saraj to be planned as the new capital as we build a canal between the Don and the Volga rivers. The old slums and inadequate buildings will be swept away as the new city of Slavyansk becomes the symbol of the might of the Slavs over the Steppe people.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

URUS13.D;The Commonwealth is barely stable joke of a state, but it is still a state that will make it hard to expand west until it has been entirely dealt with. There is two possible ways that the Commonwealth can be completely destroyed in a very short amount of time. The first is to wait until the inevitable Second Sejm and allow its internal politics to tear the nation to pieces. However, this option may take decades and a alternative option is presented to $COUNTRY$ if it is §Rwestern focused§W. That option is to trigger a early second sejm which will likely accelerate the collapse of the nation to occur in less then a decade, rather then several.  §RDirect conquest and integration is completely impossible until the Commonwealth is dead or it has centralized§W.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.T;The new Troubles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.D;The idea of a united Russia was born under the leadership of the Princes of Moscow in the XIVth and XVth century, but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia. Yaroslav, Moscow and Ryazan all had their hour of glory but Tatar attacks, Polish and Scandinavian support for their enemies and pure incompetence led to an ever changing balance of power between the three principalities. Konstantin XI Belsky of Yaroslavl hopes to unify the Russians under his absolute rule to modernize the country. The Repnins of Ryazan must face a powerful boyar assembly who thrives on serfdom. Meanwhile, Nizhny Novgorod never had the power of the other contestants, though its links to the East and the confusing situation surrounding her Prince Alexey II may lead to an opportunity to get power. The status quo holds because of the Scandinavian and Polish networks in the area but with Poland and Scandinavia growing weaker it will soon break.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.T;The Principality of Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.D;In 1836, the Lyapunov principality of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, the defection of a Smolensk noble confederation in Vyazma to Moscow, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europe’s sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians. In the meantime his sister Anna reigns in Nizhny Novgorod alongside her husband Alexey II. But troubles are brewing in all of Russia as the Republic of Novgorod crumbles under its contradictions while the various princes hope to vanquish us to reunify what Ivan III nearly achieved in the XVth century.\nWarning: Moscow has the hardest time forming Russia since it only has access to the Form Russia decision since it is the status quo candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.T;The Principality of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.D;The Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between Russian states and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Yaroslavl-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere of influence and in the last 40 years the title of Prince of Smolensk has been part of the long list of honorifics of the Polish king. The princedom is de facto ruled by a Governor, currently General Aleksander Kilinski, who has to wrestle authority with the local Duma controlled by boyar families and the archeparch. Smolensk has agitated for years against Poland, and the recent loss of its eastern territories to Moscow has cemented the idea among the population and the elites that the Polish yoke will have to be thrown out and Smolesnk must regain its independence. Smolensk is the Russian state that has been the most influenced by the West with works of the Enlightenment translated and discussed in the salons of the capital: should it seize the occasion and unite Russia, it will surely be a new era for Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.T;Polonizacja;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.D;The annexation of Smolensk by the Commonwealth led to the extension of Western habits in the Princedom. Smolensk is thus home to the first Russian-language University and has become one of the liveliest cultural centres of Eastern Europe, especially for literature and theatrical drama. In the halls of the university, students gather in various meetings and recent inquiries have shown the development of nationalist speeches in its halls. Governor Aleksander Kilinski decided to act by passing a law to bring the Smolensk university to the same standard as the rest of the Rzeczpospolita, namely making the usage of Polish language mandatory while restricting access to the Jewish and non-Uniate students. Of course it meant receiving the approval of the Duma which had vetoed most of his decisions in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.A;Smolensk will be taught Polish!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.B;The law is vetoed in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.T;University protests;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.D;The Polish debate in the Duma was met with hostility by the student leaders and some professors who criticized both the Polonization policy of the Governor acting on the orders of Warsaw and the aristocratic Duma that clung to its privilege. Students poured into the streets brandishing a banner of gold, blue, and white that has become in the previous years a pan-Russian nationalist symbol. The demonstration nearly ended in a riot before the Smolenskian guards of Kilinski dispersed the students without shedding any blood. The day after, a new journal was born, 'Svoboda i Narodnost' (Freedom and Nation) whose director Michel Shafirov had become a public figure following a speech in the demonstration. It has become evident to many Polish administrators that Smolensk could erupt into revolt in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.A;Damn students!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.T;The Smolensk Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.D;Unrest had grown in the whole principality for months, with the newspaper 'Freedom and Nation' stirring up the various causes of discontent against Warsaw. Following the news of the death of the King of the Commonwealth, the various nationalist groups clamored for an end to Polish rule in Smolensk and demonstrations erupted in the capital. With students joined by the members of all classes of the city, Governor Kilinski was soon abandoned by his troops and forced to flee to Kaunas. The Duma was soon convened by the archeparch and the nobles were quick to use the events to proclaim Smolenskian independence. However the crowd led by Shafirov, soon entered the Duma demanding the abolition of serfdom. With the troops rallied to the insurgents, the archeparch soon proclaimed its end and called for the Duma to reconvene two weeks later to decide the future of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.A;The revolution has freed the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.T;Ending the Regency.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.D;As the archeparch had proclaimed, the Duma reconvened to decide who shall rule the Principality. Adding to the traditional seats held by the boyars and the clergy, the cities had sent representatives for the first time in its history. In this new assembly the archeparch proposed for prince, the experienced Vasily Kropotkin, a descendant of the Rurikids. Meanwhile the aristocrats attempted to place one of their own, Stanislav Bagushevic, wary of the power of a prince supported by the archeparch. With the nobility split, it was to the new deputies to decide. Shafirov who represented Smolensk meanwhile advocated for the end of the princedom: Smolensk should be a confederation under the symbolic protection of the archeparch like in Kiev and most of all grant voting rights to all its population. He argued that liberating the serfs was meaningless without their participation in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS8.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.D;Kilinski had been forced to flee, but he did not intend to let the revolutionaries win. Without any support of the Sejm in Warsaw he was forced to rely on the political networks and relations he had created while in office. He gained support in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the plans for Russian national unification and had stronger ties with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy would have succeeded if he had not been discovered crossing the border, and forced to flee back to Warsaw. Eventually the Smolenskian forces were able to disperse the Litvins in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS10.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.D;Kilinski may have failed to take control of Smolensk but he soon find enough supporters in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the promises of war made by the new government, and had stronger ties with the Commonwealth than with Russia. He has now proclaimed the secession of the southern provinces who hoist the Pahonia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.A;Smolensk is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.T;The Vyazma Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.D;A decade ago the boyars of our eastern provinces have left the principality, choosing the prince of Moscow as their new liege due to heavy taxation imposed by Kilinski. This was a blow to the already waning influence of the Commonwealth which could not lift a finger to avoid it, mostly because they had allied with Moscow against Scandinavia and Yaroslavl. With our independence secured many think it is time to reclaim our lost lands, secure the capital, and prepare ourselves for the fight to come. But many nobles are angered by the end of serfdom in Smolensk. These nobles refuse to aid in preparations for war, while the Duma is increasingly divided on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.A;War will come anyway, we must strike first!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.B;War is vetoed in the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.T;The Vozhd;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.D;The veto of war preparatives has paralysed the Duma, and the aristocracy clashed with the nationalists and liberals. Eventually the situation deteriorated to the point that a young officer, Commander Mikhail Tomylovic, left his barrack with his regiment and stormed the Duma. Unknown before, this officer that has risen from the ranks and whose parents were freed serfs, is now in charge of the destiny of the state. Tomylovic has proclaimed himself 'Vozhd' (the Leader of the People), has abolished the Duma, and finally arrested several boyars of high rank while forcing the archeparch to resign from his leadership role. Now the preparations begin for the oncoming war, for the Vozhd will not let Moscow bring shame to Smolesnk anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.A;A new leader for Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.T;The Smolensk embassy;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.D;Eventually the demands of the Smolenskian state were dispatched to the prince of Moscow: he was to cede back the unlawful territories he had usurped in the past decade or face war from Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.A;It is merely for diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.T;Smolenskian declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.D;We had extended our western border in 1829 following the secession of a league of nobles angered by taxation from the Polish administration of Smolensk. But now declaring independence, Smolensk comes after us in an attempt to reclaim these lands. Warsaw had not interved when Smolensk had declared its revolution, and they will not intervene now for such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.A;We can defeat Smolensk easily!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.T;The declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS15.A;Vyazma shall be ours again!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.T;Return of the Vyazman Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.D;Moscow has been crushed by our modern forces and we have retaken our lands in the east. It is a great victory for $COUNTRY$ and the first actions we have undertaken is to put to trial the boyars who seceded in 1829 while freeing the serfs from these provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.A;Smolensk is ascendant!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.D;Just as we have delivered a blow to our enemies in the west, we’ve also repelled our enemies in the east. The conniving general Alexander Kilinski has attempted to overthrow our government and the duma in order to drag Smolensk back into polish servitude. The coup naturally found no support from the people of Smolensk, and the army has quickly captured and detained the general and his litvin collaborators from Polotsk. Kilinski has already been executed for his crimes, and his supporters who did not flee to Poland wait in our prisons, and will surely meet a similar fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.A;The integrity of Smolensk has triumphed!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.D;A peculiar figure has briefly reemerged in Smolensk: the traitor Kilinski. He was surrounded by Litvins, who wished to return Smolensk to the authority of Warsaw. Kilinski and his supporters against leader Tomylovic and Smolensk were gunned down by our militia as they attempted to make their way through our great city. However, the leader was greatly agitated by this coup, and perceived the litvins in the west as perpetrators, and betrayers of the russian people. The leader of the people, Mikhail Tomylovic, has unleashed the army of Smolensk on the countryside, massacring litvins who are believed to be conspirators.\n\nSmolensk is bloody and quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.A;Smolensk remains unshakeable!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.T;:Insurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.D;Our forces, bloodied and beaten by the muscovite army, have been taken by surprise. General Kilinski has marched on Smolensk with the support of dissatisfied litvins in order to restore the authority of the polish crown! Our brave men have managed to repel the traitor, but were unable to capture or kill him. Kilinski has now fled to Polotsk, and began preparations for an active insurrection against the princedom. The details regarding his efforts are muddy, and we are not sure to what degree the former-governor has managed to whip up support among the litvins. Regardless of that, our army is preparing for an armed confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.A;Smolensk will NOT be torn to pieces!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.T;A free Polotsk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.D;The prince of Smolensk has finally been driven out of Polotsk, and we have achieved freedom from the east. The militiamen of Polotsk roam its streets, safe and unmolested. Now that the future of Polotsk lays within our hands and not those of the Russian, we may decide our fate: we could attempt to join our kin in the grand duchy of Lithuania, or remain a sovereign and independent state.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.A;Let us unite with our people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.B;Polotsk will remain free and strong!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.T;Polotsk secedes from Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.D;To our surprise, the fledgling Polotsk insurgency has driven out the princely forces of Smolensk. The Polotsk insurgents first took arms to bring the whole of Smolensk back to our hands, but after failing their objective, they resorted to break free from the principality altogether. Now the small state has petitioned us for annexation into the grand duchy of Lithuania. Naturally, we see no problem with such an arrangement, but the Sejm does. The Sejm has shot down Polotsk's proposal with a veto, leaving our relationship in an awkward and uncertain state. The best we could do is wait for a better time.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.A;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.T;The Sejm refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.D;The people of Polotsk are in shock as news from Warsaw has arrived: the polish Sejm has refused to admit our ascension into the grand duchy of Lithuania! Our government is uncertain about how to proceed, as we have fought tooth and nail against Smolensk for the unity of our people. The best we can hope for is a more favorable situation in Warsaw...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.A;How could they do such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.T;A Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.D;When Stanislaw Habsburg was convicted as a traitor by the Sejm, he pondered his options. Austria may have been the seat of his house but the Polish branch had cut ties with Wien following the German wars and the rift had never been healed. Moreover it meant becoming a pawn in Bohemian hands, something Stanislaw could not accept. Thus he went to Moscow, joining his sister Maria, wed decades before to the prince Peter III Lyapunov. Over the years Stanislaw had proved himself a strong strategist, at least on paper, and a commander his men respected and looked up to. Now settled in the Kremlin, he has asked for a commandment to at least 'be useful' in his exile. Approved by the Prince, this move has been criticised by some members of the pro-Polish faction who fear that the Commonwealth may look towards Moscow once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.A;The Commonwealth is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.D;The succession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslavl. Having produced no offspring despite his decade of marriage, both hope to inherit the principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for figurative and performing arts. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that the Prince is a homosexual and thus unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have wept at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' and decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife and counts Balakhnin and Varankin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS24.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.D;The succession of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is both the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite having been married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver hope to inherit the Principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for theater and ballets. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that a Prince enjoying acting on stage among other 'foreign vices' is unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have been so angered at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' that he decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife Anna as the counts Kondraty Balakhnin and Grigory Varankin, both men known for their respective ties to Tver and Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.A;Retiring alone in his dacha will not give him an offspring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.T;A day in the countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.D;Alexey II has been enjoying his sojourn at his hunting dacha, which was embellished by his father in order to make it as furnished as the palace in the city. Alexey has enlarged the estate, reserving an entire aisle for his theatrical endeavours. When Anna Lyapunova, his wife, came to the residency with General Temey Talantsev escorting her, the Prince was playing the main role of Orpheus, a melodrama by the Bohemian playwright, Ludwid Schubert. Following the ending of the play, the prince retired to his private quarter with his wife. No one knew what has occured during their exchange but the princess has decided to reside for an indefinite time in the dacha with her husband, leaving the affairs of state to the various factions of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.A;What is the meaning of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.T;An heir for Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, Prince Alexey has emerged to announce that his wife is pregnant with an heir. 2 years earlier, in order to relieve his melancholy caused by the attacks of politicians and the pressures of his natural family and in-law-family, Alexey had delegated all political affairs to Anna Lyapunova, with whom he had an undeniable close and affectionate relationship. This announcement at the end of a routine long stay of the princess at the dacha has shocked the Russian courts, many speculating that the presumptive heir would actually be a legitimised child of the Princess and her latest publicly known paramour. Yet after a slightly premature childbirth, healthy Mikhail Belsky was declared the natural son of the prince and princess and sole legitimate heir to Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS27.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the cousin of our prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to Nizhny Novgorod to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we would have the right to denounce the child as illegitimate to claim the principality that was ours but a few decades ago. But should Moscow support the princess and recognize her offspring as legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.A;Congratulate Alexey for the enlargement of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.B;Mikhail is a bastard and Anna a woman of little virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.T;Family news;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the brother-in-law of our Prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod, has emerged back in his capital to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. The Moscow court was always wary of Anna who always appeared ambitious and full of vices for the devout circles in court. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we could denounce the conduct of Anna Lyapunova. But should Yaroslavl support the princess and recognize her offspring legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the ourt of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.A;Congratulate Anna for her child!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.B;Anna has dishonored the Lyapunov family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.T;Denunciation  of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.D;The prince of Moscow has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, denouncing the shameful conduct of the princess, and accusing her of using another man to cover for the 'foreign vices' of her husband. Count Kondraty Balakhnin, the leader of the pro-Yaroslavl faction in the court has joined the prince in the palace to suggest to him the dissolution of the Duma and to purge the Muscovite plotters that held power in it, with the support of Yaroslavl of course. Meanwhile the princess warned him of the influence of the Yaroslavl faction that could use the purge of the Duma to ensure their own power in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.A;Alexey trusts the Count.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.B;Alexey follows the advice of his wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.T;A letter to Yaroslavl;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.D;The plots of the Yaroslavl faction have born fruit. Following the recent events at the Court and in the Duma, Count Balakhnin has secured power and put the princely family under surveillance in their palace to avoid the various assassination plots that had sprung in the previous weeks. Exchanges of letters between Nizhny Novgorod and the court of Yaroslav are seen daily as the Count prepares for the reunification of the Belsky familial lands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.A;One Belsky replaced with another;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.T;A letter from Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.D;Our man in Nizhny Novgorod, the Count Balakhnin has taken power following the events that saw the discussion of the legitimacy of the heir of the principality by our rivals in Moscow. Nizhny Novgorod is now our puppet and Balakhnin assures us that the current situation will soon 'be resolved' as the melancholy of the Prince is becoming more evident each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.A;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.T;The end of the Principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.D;Events unfolded quickly in the principality. Alexey was found dead, hanging in his residence. The prince always had depressive excesses and the news of his suicide did not surprise any at the court. His death was masked as a 'bad fall' to not tarnish his memory but as soon as he was buried Balakhnin moved. Disregarding heir Mikhail as an infant, and the Duma still dissolved, he convened an assembly of firendly boyars and together offered the crown to the senior Belsky branch in Yaroslavl. Meanwhile the dowager princess was abducted by remnants of the Moscow faction, and sent her to her brother who made her abdicate her claims to the principality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.T;Anna's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.D;On the advice of his wife, Alexey asked the Duma to confirm Mikhail as heir of the principality but faced opposition from the boyars who refused to acknowledge his successor given Muscovite accusations. His attempt to dissolve the Duma and enforce his succession by decree failed due to the betrayal of military figures close to the pro-Moscow circle including Grigory Varankin, a former paramour of his wife. In the chaos that followed, the three leaders of the boyar cliques in Nizhny Novgorod all had their chance at power. Balakhnin proposed to reconvene the Duma while purging the Muscovite with the help of Yaroslavl, Grigory Varankin's soldiers were ready to take power and reclaim the lands of Ivanovo from Yaroslavl with Muscovian help while Anna Lyapunova urged the General Temey Talantsev secure the regency for her son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.A;Balakhnin secures the Duma for the Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.B;Varankin vows to reclaim the rightful lands in Yaroslav;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.C;Talantsev secures the independence of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.T;Varankin secures power Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and assumed power in Nizhny Novgorod. The general has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from yaroslavl with our support. Of course, in actuality he has ceded the principality to us. Yaroslavl is outraged by the coup, decrying the actions of Varankin as illegitimate and unlawful, and vowing to bring Nizhny Novgorod down by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.A;Time to march north!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.T;Varankin seizes power in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and stole Nizhny Novgorod away to the muscovites. Varankin has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from us with support from Moscow. Varankin has effectively ceded the authority of Nizhny Novgorod to Moscow, and his aggressive posturing is tantamount to a declaration of war! How should we respond to this affront?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.A;We will restore our rule over Nizhny Novgorod once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.B;Can we really afford an armed confrontation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.T;Nizhny Novgorod asks for help;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.D;Temey Talantsev is a Nizhegorodian general of Mari-Chuvash origins, who has managed to become the regent during the chaos that ensued after Nizhny Novgorod’s succession crisis. Now both Moscow and yaroslavl are ready to pounce on the principality. Furthermore, Nizhny Novgorod has petitioned us for help against both of their neighbours.\n\n This venture could prove to be very dangerous for Kazan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.A;We embrace Nizhny Novgorod’s call to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.B;Are they out of their minds?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.T;Regent Talantsev calls for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.D;Regent Talantsev has asserted Nizhny Novgorod’s by executing sympathetic agents of Moscow and Yaroslavl that have operated in the army and the Duma. Now, as relations between us, Moscow, and yaroslavl are in shambles, the regnet wishes to take the fight to yaroslavl and Moscow as a way to put their political meddling to an end. Most of our government fears this proposition and believes this idea to hasten the demise of the principality, but the regent remains steadfast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.A;We will bring the schemers to their knees!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.B;We must back away from this insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.T;Pouncing on Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.D;The Muscovite scheme has blown up in their face. Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow and yaroslavl are now locked in a war together, and letting Moscow get away with their schemes is unacceptable. Our government has decided to take advantage of Moscow’s folly and strike while the iron is hot. We will launch an attack on the principality of Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.A;Moscow will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.T;Denunciation of the the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.D;The Prince of Yaroslavl has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, accusing the new heir of being a bastard, and citing adultery on the part of princess Anna Lyapunova as the reason. As a response to this outcry, the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma began to accuse the princess of despotism and attempted to replace her with Count Balakhnin as the regent of Nizhny Novgorod. Fortunately, the army has come to the princess’ aid and refused to make any moves against her. The situation does not remain under control for long, a few months later Prince Alexy suddenly collapses during dinner with Anna and his entourage, he spends the next days under intense medical care before finally dying. Nizhny Novgorod swirls up in chaos as the bickering factions of the Duma begin to accuse one another of assassinating the prince. Some accuse the princess, while some accuse the Yaroslavl faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.A;Grigory Varankin arrests the princess! (Will result in Nizhny Novgorod’s annexation);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.B;The army supports the princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.T;Moscow occupies Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.D;General Varankin has decided to exploit the situation in Moscow’s favor. Under the cover of night the general, surrounded by other Moscow loyalists, has entered the residence of the princess and arrested both her and the heir Mikhail. The group has quickly whisked the two away to Moscow. The prince of Moscow has acted quickly and advanced into Nizhny Novgorod unopposed. The end of a sovereign Nizhny Novgorod is here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.A;Moscow ascendent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.D;Our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexy’s death. Princess Anna Lyapunov and her son were arrested and brought to Moscow, and our armies have marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasn’t for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be “its lawful and sovereign land”, and it’s apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.T;Princess Anna confirmed as regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.D;With the backing of the army, Princess Annah Lyapunova has managed to crush and purge the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma. Now with a compliant Duma, the princess has managed to get the Duma to officially confirm her as the Princess-Regent of Nizhny Novgorod.Wasting no time, the princess-regent has appointed the half-Tatar General Talantsev as her prime minister, together the two began to introduce reforms to centralize the state, keep the boyars in line, and rein in the middle class. The princess-regent has also taken an aggressive stance on Yaroslavl and the lands of Ivanovo, promising to bring this lawful part of Nizhny Novgorod into the fold. On the other hand, Moscow and Yaroslavl are not impressed with our new government and the harsh treatment of the boyars who holds loyalties to their principalities, and the already shaken relations between our nations have all but disintegrated, as the two hostile princes will surely take on a violent approach to deal with our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.A;Let them come! The princess-regent and Nizhny Novgorod are ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.T;Moscow and Yaroslavl recognize our heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.D;To our surprise, both the princes of Yaroslavl and Moscow have recognized Mikhail Belsky as the new heir to Nizhny Novgorod. We hope that today might mark the beginning of a more friendly relationship between our domains. In any case, it seems that for now the position of our heir is secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.A;God save Mikhail Belsky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.T;General Grigory Varankin dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.D;The Moscow aligned General Grigory Varankin has recently died under suspicious circumstances. The general’s corpse was discovered frozen in the Oka river during the early hours of the morning. In the following days the Duma became a battleground as Yaroslavl-friendly members of the Duma began to accuse Princess Anna of assassinating General Varankin with the help of her lover General Talantsev. The muscovite faction of the Duma is especially harsh on Talantsev, attacking and emphasizing his Tatar heritage.\n\nSensing the change in course, Talantsev flees to Kazan while Anna’s allies slowly back away from the scene. In a last bid to save their princely power, Anna implores Prince Alexy to take action against the chaos and intrigue of the Duma. The prince won’t budge. Coherency is all but lost in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.A;Can’t anything work out here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.T;Prince Alexy abdicates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.D;The Green Prince, sensing that the end is near, has officially announced his abdication, the prince is preparing to depart to a monastery to live out the rest of his life. But in a last ditch effort to salvage his legacy, the prince has petitioned the Duma to officially pronounce Anna Lyapunova as princess-regent. Princess Anna, unfortunately, has lost all of her allies, as both the Moscow and Yaroslavl factions of the Duma have torn her and each other apart. There are talks of a partition between Yaroslavl and Moscow, and even downright war. Stories from the east have also begun to surface, they speak of a disgraced tatar general gathering supporters for a final bid for power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.A;Yaroslavl marches on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.B;Moscow Marches on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.C;Talantsev returns from exile and crushes his opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.D;As Prince Alexy of Nizhny Novgorod has finally abdicated from his throne, the nizhgorodian Duma has been thrown into chaos. However our sympathizers in the Duma have managed to secure a strong enough of a foothold to allow us to march unopposed into the city!\n\nUnfortunately, we now face opposition from Moscow, who view the restoration of our rule as unlawful and illegitimate. The muscovites are allegedly already preparing for an armed conflict as their forces muster at our borders...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.A;The Yaroslav Faction is victorious. §RGAME OVER§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.B;The Moscow Faction is victorious. §RGAME OVER§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.C;Talantsev is victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.D;Despite the death of our main representative in Nizhny Novgorod, General Grigory Varankin, our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexy’s abdication. His wife, Princess Anna, was powerless to control the army, and our forces marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasn’t for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be “its lawful and sovereign land”, and it’s apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.T;Our heir remains unrecognized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.D;The princes of Moscow and Yaroslavl have rejected the legitimacy of our heir, Mikhail Belsky! They claim that Alexy’s effeminate nature and dubious sexuality muddies the circumstances of his son’s birth and throws the whole ordeal into question. Alexy’s reaction is even more surprising, the Green Prince has come out of isolation and began to assert himself (against the wishes of his aides) as the ruler of the principality. Anna Lyapunov has not taken this encroachment kindly. The princess’ views towards a modernist government and military strongly contrasts against her husband’s humanist and democratic views, and his hatred of secret police and the death penalty. This conflict between the princely consorts has created a divide in the government and Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, and now two factions, a pro-Alexy and pro-Anna have been formed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.A;A shocking turn of events!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.T;General Talantsev is killed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.D;Controversy rocks Nizhny Novgorod as the death of General Talantsev, one of Princess Anna’s closest allies, is made public. The general has been killed while apparently plotting the assassination of Prince Alexy and the burning of his dacha to make it look like an accident! His death by his former co-conspirator is now the topic of a heated discussion, some believe Princess Anna to be behind Talantsev’s plot, but others claim that the entire event was coaxed by the Green Prince to kill one of his wife’s allies. The Duma is currently at a crossroad, there’s great confusion regarding who’s allied to whom, and the military is beginning to grow very distrustful towards the Duma and the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.A;Prince Alexy arrests Anna and restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.B;The army remains loyal to Princess Anna!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.T;Nizhny Novgorod arrests Princess Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.D;Upon the rejection of our recognition of their heir, the prince and princess of Nizhny Novgorod have begun to bicker among themselves. And now after an attempt on his feeble life, Prince Alexy has arrested his own wife Anna Lyapunov with the help of that scoundrel General Varankin! Our own royalty now rots in a Nizhgorodian prison. Our aides now encourage us to send an offer to Prince Alexy: to recognise his heir in favor of the freedom of the member of our princely family.\n\nsome see this as a show of weakness, but most believe that Yaroslavl would make a move on the Nizhgorodians if we’d let the situation deteriorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.A;Send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.B;Perhaps we should not intervene...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.T;Moscow offers recognition for the release of the princess;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.D;Prince Alexy has wrestled control over the principality and arrested Princess Anna with the help of the ruthless General Varankin. Together the two have dissolved the Duma and proclaimed the autocracy of Alexey Belsky, while Varankin was appointed as the “Plenipotentiary Minister”. While Alexy has managed to push some serf reforms, his minister has held most of the power in Nizhny Novgorod. This struggle has been interrupted by Moscow, who offered Alexy recognition of his rule as the prince of Nizhny Novgorod for the release of Princess Anna Lyapunov, a member of Moscow’s princely family.\nPrince Alexy is naturally ecstatic about the chance to ensure his rule and the independence of his state. Varankin on the other hand does not trust Moscow, and a vicious struggle between the two has begun behind the scenes...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.A;Can’t we just reach an agreement?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.T;Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.D;Prince Alexy and Minister Varankin’s cooperation has reached its end point. Today the prince is ordering the army to detain and remove minister Varankin from his post, fearing that Varankin would do to him as he has done to the princess over their dispute regarding Moscow’s offer.\n\nAt the same time however, the minister has started to march through the streets of Nizhny Novgorod, flanked by a mounted cavalry company friendly to him. The band is currently marching towards the prince’s residence while civilians flee the scene. Varankin is steadfast in his distrust of Moscow, and believes that removing Alexy before he agrees to Moscow’s ultimatum is the only way to preserve the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.A;Varankin enters the compound and guns Alexy down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.B;Alexy intercepts Varankin and executes him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.T;The prince of Nizhny Novgorod dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.D;A battle has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has been gunned down and dismembered by his own minister, General Grigory Varankin. Due to our refusal to recognise the dead prince’s son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we officially view the throne of the principality as vacant. We may have the opportunity to press forwards and claim the principality as our own! However, we should keep in mind that Moscow will not take this move lightly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.A;Claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.B;Perhaps we shouldn’t encourage a Muscovite retaliation...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.T;Moscow prepares to move on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.D;An insurgency has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has won out against his own minister, General Grigory Varankin, who attempted to rebel out of disagreements regarding negotiations with Moscow. But the prince’s negotiations with the traitorous Muscovite have been for nothing, as news from Moscow hint that its prince is preparing to betray Nizhny Novgorod and make war on it! Some of our advisors have suggested offering prince Alexy our “protection” against Moscow in favor of vassalage. But due to our refusal to recognise the dead prince’s son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we may be able to declare Alexey as unfit to rule and press our own claim on the throne. In that case, we should expect Muscovite resistance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.A;Send Alexey an offer of friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.B;We’ll strike now! Down with Nizhny Novgorod, and down with Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.T;Moscow betrays the agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.D;To the shock of the Green Prince, the Muscovites did not honor their agreement. Our claim to the throne remains snubbed, and the principality has begun to mass its armies in preparation for war! But perhaps we have a chance to survive this catastrophe. Yaroslavl has approached Prince Alexy with an offer, “Commit your principality to a closer bond with ours, and we’ll help you.” The court understands the meaning of this offer, and most of Alexey’s aides push the prince to accept as a last ditch effort to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.A;We’ll bend the knee...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.B;After I’m through with Moscow, YOU are next Yaroslavl!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.T;Nizhny Novgorod returns Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.D;The Nizhgorodians have buckled under our pressure and released Anna Lyapunov to us! Now we have a magnificent opportunity to press our claim on the whole of Nizhny Novgorod! Without Princess Anna at the helm, we may revoke our recognition of Alexey’s child and declare him unfit to rule, leaving us with a casus belli to take the principality to ourselves! Of course this will provoke Yaroslavl to action, but how could we pass on this opportunity?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.A;To Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.B;We can’t break our promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.T;Princess Anna restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.D;Despite Prince Alexy’s position as the de jure authority in the principality, Anna Lyapunov has managed to make powerful allies among the army and the boyars. Following the consorts' struggle for power, the princess has managed not only to sideline the Green Prince, but also to imprison him on charges of conspiracy against her and the principality! Now aided by Count Balakhnin, the princess has been declared “Princess-Regent” and began to purge the principality of her enemies. But not all is well for Anna, for Prince Alexy has died in his prison cell a few short weeks after his fall from power. Currently Yaroslavl, whose prince is the cousin of Alexy, is enraged by his imprisonment. Should he find out that the Green Prince is dead, we’ll be in great trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.A;Keep calm and don’t let the truth leak;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.T;Prince Alexy’s becomes public!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.D;Our fears have manifested! The death of Prince Alexy has become public due to a leak by one of the prison’s officers. We haven’t heard from Yaroslavl yet, but since they never recognized Mikhail as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, they might just claim the principality for themselves as the only legitimate member of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.A;Call the army! Prepare for the worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.T;Alexy Belsky dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.D;To our shock Prince Konstantin’s cousin, Prince Alexy, has died! He has succumbed to illness in a Nizhgorodian cell. Our court naturally blames his death on the negligence of his traitorous wife who imprisoned him in the first place, Anna Lyapunov. Due to our stance on the princess’ son, Mikhail, as an illegitimate heir, we may have an opportunity to claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod back! Naturally, we must expect Moscow to come to the aid of Anna Lyapunov, as the princess is from its royal family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.A;Vengeance for Belsky’s blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.B;Can we afford to antagonize Moscow?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.T;Moscow advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.D;Moscow has moved into Nizhny Novgorod, seizing unlawfully what is naturally the integral and rightful land of the principality. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls for the reclamation of Yaroslavl’s birthright, and for dismemberment of the vain muscovites!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.A;We musn’t let Moscow get away with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.B;We can’t afford to challenge Moscow...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.T;Yaroslavl advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.D;Yaroslavl has already occupied Ivanovo for long enough, but now Yaroslavl has exploited the chaos in the principality and moved into Nizhny Novgorod itself, completing their vile conquest of what would be better off in our hands. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls to put Yaroslavl’s crime to an end, and to restore the honor and glory of Moscow and her prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.A;We mustn't let Yaroslavl covet what’s ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.B;We can’t afford to challenge Yaroslavl...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.D;Our prince and his loyal army have marched out to meet greedy Yaroslavl in battle! And victorious our prince and country are. By beating Yaroslav back, and asserting our rightful claim to Nizhny Novgorod, we have gotten closer to our dream of a Russian empire. Let prince Konstantin fear our advance, for no petty principality can stop Moscow’s destiny now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.A;Moscow emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.D;Belsky’s birthright is once again restored! Our rightful claim to the principality of Nizhny Novgorod, that has been confirmed already by the right of blood, has now been confirmed by the right of conquest! Moscow is beaten and has fled back to their own land, while Prince Konstantin celebrates our successful campaign in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.A;Yaroslavl emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.T;Moscow offers annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.D;In an expected delegate from Moscow, Princess Anna has received an offer from Prince Peter III of Moscow: the cession Nizhny Novgorod in return for monetary compensation for the princess-regent. Princess Anna may retire to live the rest of her life in leisure if she cedes the principality to her family’s hands. The court patiently awaits the princess’ response...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.A;Princess Anna accepts the deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.B;Princess-regent Anna rejects the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.T;The Generalissimo of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.D;Years ago, Talantsev was a minor noble coming from a Chuvash elder family that had made fortune on the Volga between the Khanate of Kazan and the Russian principalities. His talents were recognized and he gained rank thanks to the affection of Anna Lyupanova. But in the end he took power in the troubled times that faced Nizhny Novgorod abolishing the principality and taking the helm. He defended the independence of the city and proved to the people that he was a natural leader. Thanks to his new popularity he was able to crush boyar opposition and proclaim the end of serfdom. Now he has turned back on its Tatar allies claiming to free the people of Tartariya from slavery as he liberated serfs. This could serve him in the next fights against the Princes of Russia, and maybe he can become the providential man needed to unify the eastern Slavs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.A;Long live the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.T;The Princess of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.D;Anna Lyapunova won against all odds. A princess whose sole job was to marry and produce an heir, she managed to surpass every expectations, sidelining her husband and ruling over the principality in its most troubled times. A master of intrigue she went from regent for her son Mikhail to princess ruling in her own right. The Duma has been abolished after her control over the state was affirmed and her first ukaze as autocrat of Nizhny Novgorod was to free the serfs living under her rule. The people have forgotten the scandals that surrounded her while Alexey was still around and she has been nicknamed the 'Mother of the People' by many pamphlets and all her trips over the country see crowds of former serfs gather to acclaim her. This opinion is shared by many in her home in Moscow, with many abolitionists looking up to the rising figure of the Lyapunov family to unify the principalities and maybe then all Russia !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS67.T;Threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is one of the main instigators behind the current situation in Russia. When at the apex of its power, the Polish Crown claimed the title of Prince of the Rus and invaded the Principalities provoking the Troubles (1592-1613). More recently they were the main instigators of the Nizhny Novgorod war, and Smolensk only regained its independence thanks to the decay of the Polish state apparatus. But now the new King of the Commonwealth has reformed the state and the country is now again a major force in Europe. The Princes of Russia must unite if they want to have a chance against the Polish Leviathan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.A;A new troubled Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.T;The Nordic threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.D;The Scandinavians have intervened in Russia for centuries, as Rurik and Oleg settled and founded Rus while Novgorod fought Swedish and Danish attacks in the times of Alexander Nevsky. More recently the Republic of the North was forced to release the Republic of Pskov that then acquired the Baltic coast. Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. Now the Scandinavians have attacked Novgorod and acquired proper Russian territory. It is an insult to all independent powers in Russia and has prompted every ruler to arm its subjects to unify the country once and for all, lest we are played once again by other powers and the Motherland is carved by them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.A;For the glory of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. But now Scandinavian's influence is waning as events in Finland have provoked independence of core territories of the Nordic Crown. The states in Central Russia are now left to their own devices as no Great Power can actually reach out to them, and the unification of Central Russia should be swift and decisive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.A;Unification or death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.T;A rumor in Russia...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.D;Central Russia has been never truly unified as all attempts failed due to foreign powers interventions and local fighting forces. Ivan III of Moscow, Dimitri I of Tver, Feodor II of Yaroslav all look down on what Russia has become and what could have been. There is a rising sentiment that Russia must evolve to survive in the modern world and that the divisions must go away for a new nation emerge and protect the Motherland from all threats. Now is the time to forge a new Principality of Rus that will avenge the woes that Russia has suffered over the centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.A;But please do not repeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.T;The Muscovite Wars era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.D;Tensions had grown between the principalities of Central Russia over the last decades, only tampered by the possibility of foreign intervention. Now that this threat is gone, every leader in Central Russia wants to claim the title and power of the Grand Principality of Rus, which few rulers could claim in the history of Russia. No longer shall Central Russia be divided, and the masses are armed and ready for the coming fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS73.D;From the ashes of the divided principalities of Central Russia emerges Muscovy, following the path traced by Ivan III the failed 'Tsar', Dimitri I 'the Savior' and Feodor II of Yaroslav. The Muscovite wars have claimed countless lives and now soldiers go back to their fields and cities to renew with a more normal life. This is the first stage for a new Russia to emerge but to avoid the fates of those who failed before, the ruler of Muscovy must now administrate the new lands under their control and let the land and its inhabitants rest before they take on new enemies and forge a true Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS76.T;The Unification of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.D;Woe be upon us! Our worst fears have been realized! After a period of anarchy, the princes of central Russia have been united into a single nation. Now the Russians stand united against their external enemies, and we can only pray that they show leniency in their dealings with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.A;We shall not go down without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.T;Submission to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.D;After having won out over the other Russian princes, the ruler of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now claims sovereignty over the entire Russian nation -- at least, what they perceive it to be. Unfortunately for us, their perceptions of Russia include the lands of our nation. A representative from the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, demanding our annexation. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.A;Can we even resist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.B;These pretenders shall never have control of our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.T;Submission of the Cossack Hosts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.D;By force or guile we have usurped the other princes and obtained a dominant position in the Russian heartland. Having secured the home front, our interests now look towards the Russians not yet united with our nation. Despite a diverse set of origins, the Cossacks are ultimately Russian in language, culture, and religion, making the independent hosts of the Wild Fields an integral part of the Russian nation. Being part of the first Russian states to live free from foreign meddling, surely the spirit of the Russian dream lives in the people of the hosts! We will petition the rulers of the independent hosts to willingly accept annexation to the growing Russian state. Those that refuse may find their people liberated from their tyrannical rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.A;The Cossacks are Russians: they must be a part of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.T;The Unification of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Russian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.D;Emerging from the chaos that embroiled the south, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has succeeded in uniting the disparate principalities of central Russia into a single unified state. They now stand as the sole power in central Russia, powerful enough and secure enough to challenge the remaining Russian states in their quest to obtain dominance over all Russia. It remains clear to all observers that $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeks the complete unification of the Russian nation -- a project that naturally includes the lands of northern Russia. Many among us see benefits to be had in our joining a unified Russian state. Depending on what they may offer us, we may even choose to willingly unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$. It remains to be seen, however, whether we can reconcile our differences, but at the very least we will hear them out on any offers they may make -- it certainly beats fighting a war over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.A;Let them know that we are listening. Now it is up to them to reciprocate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.D;For some time now the inherent contradictions in the structure of the confederation have caused the rise of factionalism within our government, with the ever-present threat of the Russians from the south the only factor uniting these factions in support of the confederation. However, with recent events, these factions have come to a head, throwing the entire confederation into disarray. Princes and republics alike are in open revolt against the authority of the Prince of Novgorod, with neither party satisfied with his rule. The Prince retains authority only over the city of Novgorod and the surrounding territories, and with any attempts at compromise being too little and too late, the remaining representatives of the Veche and the Council of Lords have unanimously declared dissolved the Novgorodian Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.A;If only we had reformed sooner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.T;Secret Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.D;It is absolutely obvious that the reunification of Russia is impossible without Novgorod. Its current masters, the Prince and his puppeteers, however, are weak and cannot control anything outside the city itself. We have a favorable offer for them - in exchange for recognition of our monarch's authority, they will all receive large estates and, ahem, monetary compensation. Our diplomats have already left for Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS80.A;Time to end the Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS81.T;Palace Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS81.D;Despite the fact that the Prince himself suddenly showed no desire to give up the phantom remnants of his power, those respectable gentlemen behind him forced him to swear an oath to the ruler of All Russia. For this, all those involved received large estates as well as a solid annual pension. Those few who refused to obey the outsiders from the south began a desperate, but pointless and short struggle - soon they will all obey the Tsar, of that there can be no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS82.T;The Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS82.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our monarch's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we offer the rulers of Novgorod nobility, large estates, and a decent pension, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will also make it clear to them that, if they refuse, a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.T;An Offer for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS83.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. In exchange for loyalty oaths, our elites are offered substantial land grants, nobility, and a pension from the Grand Prince. This offer could only be laughed at if it were not for the second part: if we refuse, we are threatened with war. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS84.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our dictator's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we threaten the rulers of Novgorod with a war, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will make it clear to them - a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.A;Simple as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS85.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. We are ordered to obey. If we do not recognize their sovereignty over Novgorod, they threaten to declare war on us. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.T;Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS86.D;The Republic and its future are the responsibility of every citizen. This is the main principle of our state, expressed by its founder. The idea of the unification of the Russian lands has long agitated the minds of many citizens of our republic. In recent years the Novgorod Republic has become much weaker than before, and the most audacious liberals among us have floated the idea of holding a plebiscite in Novgorod to unite with other Russian lands.It is absolutely clear that the citizens of Novgorod, tired of instability, will choose a strong and united Russia, so we should only wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.A;Get the champagne ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS87.T;Great Unification Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS87.D;When diplomats from the south came to propose a plebiscite on reunification, many were skeptical. At this point, however, it is obvious to all that the Novgorod Republic is over, and the end of our independence is only a matter of time. In the plebiscite held today, the proposal for reunification received an absolute majority of votes. On the streets, people rejoice at the end of the turbulent instability and look forward to the bright future - a future in a unified Russian republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS87.A;Better them than Scandies, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS88.T;Stubboness of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS88.D;The Republic and its future are the responsibility of every citizen. This is the main principle of our state, expressed by its founder.

In recent years the Novgorod has become much weaker than before, and the most audacious liberals among us have floated the idea of holding a plebiscite in Novgorod to unite with other Russian lands.However, any attempt at peaceful reunification could be undermined by the tyrannical government of the former republic. Our agents of influence have enough resources to hold a plebiscite, but if the government of Novgorod does not agree to the results, we should have a plan B ready.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS88.A;A plan B? That's how we call that?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS89.T;Great Unification Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On the streets, people rejoice at the end of the turbulent instability and look forward to the bright future - a future in a unified Russian republic. But should we share their joy? The stupidity of the people proved to us long ago the necessity of a dictatorship, and even now we are not ready to give up. The independence of Novgorod should be above all!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS89.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS89.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS90.T;The End of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS90.D;The greater Novgorodian Republic, our former master, is now gone. A new hegemon has bent over the ruins of the ancient city, and now we are all alone in the face of an imminent threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS90.A;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.T;Question of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS91.D;Now, with Novgorod gone, we have to make a decision. Should we join the new Russian hegemon voluntarily? No official ambassadors have been sent to us to propose annexation, but it is absolutely clear that such a thing will happen soon. If we do not join now, we will be forced to face the military force of a united Russia -- a force that will be difficult, if not impossible, to defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.B;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.T;Pan-Russianism in Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.D;While Lord Novgorod the Great has managed to resolve its internal struggles, it has thus far remained divorced from the affairs of the other Russian principalities. Novgorod's isolation has upset the pan-Russian factions within Novgorod, who believe that the city should leverage its influence and unite the disparate Russian states into a single nation. Our recent ascent however has convinced many supporters of the pan-Russian movement in Novgorod that $COUNTRY$ and not Novgorod is the true heir of Rurik, and to that end we have taken the opportunity to aid our brethren within Novgorod in fulfilling our destiny as the natural leader of all Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.A;Novgorod must bend her knee to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.T;The Pan-Russian Revolt of $year$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.D;While pan-Russian demonstrations have become common in recent years, the successful reassertion of our hegemony over the confederation has de-legitimized most such movements, allowing us to keep them in check. However, a pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has recently broken out all across the country, paralyzing communications and diverting our forces away from the capital. Taking advantage of the chaos, a group of partisans has advanced on the Veche and the Council of Lords in an attempt to coerce them into electing the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as Prince of Novgorod. While there can be no doubt that our southern neighbors are responsible for this attempted coup, our main concern is to deal with the threat of these rebels. How shall we react?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.A;Our forces have been overwhelmed. Stand down lest there be more unnecessary bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.B;All is not yet lost! We will eject these would-be usurpers from Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.T;Union with Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.D;After some initial difficulties, the pan-Russian revolters we supported have succeeded in uniting Lord Novgorod the Great to our nation! Our king has been confirmed as the rightful Prince of Novgorod by both the Novgorodian Veche and the Council of Lords. After centuries of independence, however, the people of Novgorod are reluctant to accept the rule of what many see as a foreign usurper of the title of Prince. Armed bands of peasants and former Novgorodian garrisons alike rove the countryside, extorting the populace and thwarting our efforts to effect any sort of control over much of Novgorod. While Novgorod may now be ours -- that much will not change -- it will be some time before we can integrate these lands effectively into our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.A;With this union we have been saved from causing unnecessary bloodshed. Now we must reconcile with Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.T;Pan-Russian Separatists Flee South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.D;Despite some initial victories, the soldiers of Novgorod managed to hold key positions within the city of Novgorod, including the Veche and the Prince’s palace. With the initial shock of the uprising having worn off, the pan-Russian separatists were no longer able to compensate for the irregular nature of their forces, and having found themselves steadily losing ground to the armies of Novgorod, the pan-Russian rebels hastily withdrew from the city. Similar word has been heard throughout the rest of Novgorod, with pan-Russian rebels having been routed by local garrisons and even peasant militias hostile to their brigandry. Those surviving groups of rebels have fled across the border to their masters in the south, and only time will tell how our southern neighbor will react to this failed plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.B;Let us hope these fleas do not signal the arrival of rats from the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.T;The Conference of Kostroma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.D;With $COUNTRY$'s consolidation of power over the formerly independent princes of central Russia, Russians everywhere excitedly convene to discuss the imminent completion of Russian unification. In $CAPITAL$ and in Novgorod alike, intellectuals gather at coffeehouses to debate the nature a unified Russian nation should take, and everywhere one can find ministers and statesmen working to make the Russian dream a reality. The newest source of gossip in these circles is the ongoing Conference of Kostroma between $COUNTRY$ and Novgorod. $COUNTRY$ has been attempting to peacefully form some sort of union with Novgorod, uniting the Russian people into a single nation. To that end, $COUNTRY$ has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of Novgorod and subsequently the future of the entire Russian nation. Russians everywhere await with bated breath to see what the results of such a referendum would be, or even if the Novgorodian government would agree to such a proposal in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.A;The unification of Russia is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.T;A Referendum for the Future of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.D;Having previously agreed to conduct a referendum throughout the entirety of Novgorod regarding our possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have now counted the final tally. The results are clear: union with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has won a majority. However, while the pan-Russian supporters have won a majority, their majority is not overwhelming, and a large portion of our population still supports the independence of our state. Supporters of our independence within the government have begun to congregate and scheme to preserve the existence of the Novgorodian state. While it would alienate large parts of the populace, we could lend their movement our tacit support and renege on the results of the referendum. Such a move, however, would certainly infuriate our southern neighbor and render our government as little more than a puppet of the independence faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.A;We will respect the will of the Novgorodian people. Russia shall be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.B;$FROMCOUNTRY$ will have to pry Novgorod from our cold, dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ thought they could woo us with promises of the preservation of our ancient rights, guaranteed positions within the new government, and financial compensation for titles lost. It seems that they do not understand that our sovereignty is not for sale, and that we will not give in to their demands. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has left the conference infuriated with what they denounce as “pig-headed obstinacy,” meanwhile we have satisfied ourselves with having driven home our right to sovereignty to these foreigners. Hopefully this will finally put to rest all this nonsense of “Russian unification” and we can return to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.A;Surely nothing could go wrong with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.T;Talks Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.D;Despite our overtures of a peaceful and equitable union between our two nations, and despite our promises to ensure that all parties involved were duly compensated, the Novgorodians have rejected any offers to unite with us. The Conference of Kostroma has been deemed a failure, causing us embarrassment for having even considered negotiation with such pig-headed fools. One of our ministers has approached us with one last-ditch effort at unification with Novgorod before the situation escalates into a full-scale war. Pan-Russian undercurrents flow strongly within the Novgorodian populace, and the harsh Novgorodian regime has led many in Novgorod to consider $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule to be more tenable than that of the Novgorodians. Our ministers have been in contact with a pan-Russian secret society called the Yaroslavl Circle for some time now, but were we to provide money and matériel we could inspire them to action. A successful uprising aimed at toppling the authoritarian Novgorodian government would surely install a government more amenable to our offers of Russian unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.A;We shall support this pan-Russian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.T;The Yaroslavl Circle Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.D;While the pan-Russian tide has been rising in recent years, our government has been overall successful in quashing any sort of dissent that would threaten Novgorod. Until now, that is. A pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has broken out across the entire nation. Prominent officers and even whole garrisons have defected to their cause, leaving the entire Novgorodian army in disarray. The rebels, calling themselves the Yaroslavl Circle, already control a number of important cities and have begun to advance on the city of Novgorod in an attempt to restore the republic and elect the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as the new Prince of Novgorod. Given their aims and their weapons there can be no doubt that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is responsible for this uprising, most likely in the event of talks breaking down. And given the rebels' success, perhaps we should have taken $FROMCOUNTRY$'s original offer for unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.A;Salvage what we can, we will make peace with these rebels if they ensure our security!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.B;Never! We will turn these peasant hordes back to the fields and hovels from which they emerged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.T;The Invasion of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.D;Having consolidated our hold over central Russia, the only thing standing in the way of our complete domination over the whole of Russia is the Novgorodian Confederation. Having decided to forego the diplomatic approach, we have already begun to mobilize our armies in preparation for a sneak attack on this last barrier to Russian unification. We are the sole masters of Russia, the true heirs of Rurik, and the people of Novgorod will soon learn that for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.A;Prepare the attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.T;A Grand Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation stands on the cusp of unification. Against all odds, our republic has beaten out the old autocratic regimes of central Russia, uniting the formerly independent principalities to our own nation. At this moment, the majority of the Russian nation lives under our banner. The only remaining holdout preventing the realization of the Russian dream is Novgorod. While not the model upon which our democracy is based, the Novgorodian Confederation is nonetheless the most significant source of inspiration for our nascent republic. It was in Novgorod that the Russian nation first knew what it meant to be ruled by the people, and while the centuries were tumultuous, it was Novgorod that kept alive the flame of Rurik and of democracy in Russia. As we share this common ground of democracy with the Novgorodians, and as the Russian people yearn for the unification of the nation, let us come to terms with Novgorod in order to unite Russia as one people under one republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.A;Russia shall be united under liberal democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.T;A Grand Unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation is on the cusp of unification. To our south, the autocratic princes of the old order have been vanquished, replaced by a confederation ruled by the once-oppressed Russian people themselves. Meanwhile, our own confederation has stood the test of time, preserving the flame of Rurik even in the face of threats external and internal. Having discussed back and forth with our newly-liberated southern neighbors, and despite the differences in our ancient traditions, the Novgorodian Veche has decreed that it is time democracy reign in Russia: Lord Novgorod the Great will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$ for the good of the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.A;We will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.B;Novgorod will lead this new confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.T;A Diplomatic Approach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.D;Against all odds, our republic has prevailed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, uniting the formerly autocratic principalities into a single state ruled by the people. The Russian nation now stands on the brink of unification, with the sole remaining thorn in our side being the Novgorodian Confederation. While the original inception of Novgorod as a confederation of equals served as a spiritual precedent for our own government, the ancient institutions of the Novgorodian Confederation have proven to be non-adaptive to the demands of a modern republic. In many ways Novgorod is a shell of its former self, having de-emphasized or even completely curtailed many of its democratic traditions in favor of a more autocratic style of rule. Despite this, it is imperative that the Russian nation be unified under the banner of democracy, and we must come to some agreement with the Novgorodians in order to accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.A;Make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.T;An Offer from the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.D;Emerging from the chaos that had embroiled the south, the peasant hordes that the southern princes once lorded over have overthrown their masters and achieved dominance over central Russia. While noble in intention, these peasants have proven incapable of grasping the subtleties of our ancient institutions, and in their attempts to imitate them under the guise of "liberalism" the people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made a mockery of our nation's legacy with their republic. And it is this bastardization of our ancient confederation that has dared claim the legacy of Rurik. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently sent us a diplomatic proposal demanding that we submit to them. Refusal would most likely mean war. Our surrender would not be without generous compensation, but it would certainly mean the loss of our sovereignty and our privileged position as the middleman between Russia and the rest of Europe. Honor demands that we reject their proposal, but pragmatism says otherwise. Which consideration will win out in the end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.A;Their offer is admittedly generous. We begrudgingly accept annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.B;We will never submit to peasants who cannot understand the subtleties of our confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.D;With our refusal to accept the offer of our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Many of our top strategists are advocating a policy of pre-emptive action, favoring a surprise attack on key locations just across the border. The armies of our enemy will take quite a while to mobilize completely: by striking first, we can negate their numerical advantage. With our forces outnumbered, they argue that this is the only way we can ensure our victory in the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.A;We must strike first, to ensure our own independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.B;Such a move would be dishonorable. We must not stoop so low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.D;With our refusal to submit to our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Due to our numerical disadvantage, it is important that we strike first before the armies of our enemies are able to mobilize their forces. Otherwise we risk giving our enemy the time necessary for them to organize their armies to counter our offensive. These upstarts from the south will learn that we, not they, are the true heirs of Rurik! Russia shall be ours and ours alone to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.A;We must strike first in order to ensure our mastery over all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.T;The Figurehead Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.D;Having obtained the success we have over the other Russian principalities, it is clear that our king possesses the divine right to rule over the whole of the Russian nation. The Prince of Novgorod remains the only man left standing in open defiance of our rule. The Prince, however, is little more than a figurehead in Novgorod: the true power of that state lies in its nobility, whose loyalties can be bought. If we make a proper offering to these petty nobles we can entirely bypass the rule of this so-called "Prince" and defeat Novgorod without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.A;Forget this “Prince,” we only seek to negotiate with those who possess actual power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.T;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.D;It is no surprise that this self-proclaimed "Tsar" in $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the end of the Novgorodian state. What does come as a shock, however, is the means by which he has recently attempted to effect it. The prince of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has completely foregone diplomatic channels with our nation and has instead attempted to conduct individual dealings with the nobility. This abominable act is both a flagrant disregard for our status as an independent state and a personal insult to the authority of the Prince of Novgorod! While a few may have turned coat, those of whom we will punish severely later, the majority have rejected the offer of $FROMCOUNTRY$, professing loyalty to the Prince of Novgorod. Hopefully with this, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will know that neither our nobility nor our sovereignty can be bought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.A;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.T;The Plot Against the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.D;Surprisingly, the Novgorodian nobles have for the most part rejected our generous offer! Perhaps this figurehead prince holds more sway within Novgorod than we had initially realized. If we are able to get this prince out of the picture, however, surely we will see the mass defections of the Novgorodian nobility to our cause! Within Novgorod are various narodniks with anti-monarchical sentiments. While they may be dangerous to us in the long run, for now at least our ministers assure us that any one of these groups would readily serve as our unwitting agents in an attempt to assassinate the Prince of Novgorod, so long as we provide them the necessary support and obscure its origins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.A;We need not stoop so low ourselves. Let these peasants kill their lowly prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.T;An Assassination Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.D;A bomb has been thrown at the prince’s carriage in an attempt to end his life! While the prince is unharmed, the question remains who would orchestrate such an act? The captured terrorists claim connection to some obscure narodnik organization. While the connection is credible, the group they name, while not necessarily unknown to us, is one with little history of previous action and is known to have had limited resources. It seems unlikely that this organization acted on its own. Further investigation reveals that known members of the group have in recent weeks made trips to the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Considering the recent fallout between our two nations, it becomes clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ wished to create a power vacuum in our nation in order to encourage the defection of the nobility. We will stand insult no longer! If $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not respect our sovereignty, then perhaps we shall not recognize theirs! The people of the south live oppressed under the rule of this self-proclaimed “Tsar,” and it is our sacred duty to liberate them and unite the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.A;We shall make them pay for endangering the life of the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.T;The Divine Right of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.D;Having gained dominance over the formerly independent principalities of central Russia, it is clear -- to us at least -- that God favors us, and that we rule all Russia by divine right. These Novgorodians, however, fail to see how providence favors us. They persist in choosing rulers amongst themselves in what is little more than a glorified popularity contest, ignoring our rightful place as lords of Novgorod and Tsar of all Russia. However, they shall ignore us no longer! We have sent them an ultimatum demanding their complete and unconditional surrender. Should they fail to comply, we shall reign down destruction upon Novgorod the likes of which has never before been seen under heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.A;As God wills it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.T;The Reply of the Novgorodian Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.D;It is no secret that the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the our lands. His rhetoric proclaiming a divine right to rule all Russia, and his usage of the title “Tsar” are indicative enough of his intentions. Thus, the most recent communiqué from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador comes as no surprise to any of the representatives in the Novgorodian Veche: $FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded the dissolution of our republic and our annexation to their nation. Failure to do so will result in our “complete and wholesale destruction for defying the will of God.” Naturally, we have brushed aside his threats, though we have not sent his ambassador home empty handed. Having long expected this upcoming war, the Novgorodian Veche has unanimously approved a message addressed personally to this “Tsar” denouncing him as "$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ devil and damned devil's kith and kin,” and informing him that he “shall no longer, son of a whore, make slaves of Russian men.” Should he come, this Muscovite scullion will find himself stripped of his crown by the hands of the Russian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.A;Screw thine own mother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.T;Detente with Novgorod?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.D;Having triumphed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, our nation has achieved dominance over the Russian heartland. Now the only stumbling block to Russian unification is our relationship with Novgorod. Novogord has never been on the most friendly of terms with the southern principalities. Nevertheless since achieving preeminence in the Russian heartland we have worked to improve our relations with the Novgorodian state. Recently we have begun diplomatic talks with the Novgorodians in order to see what terms, if any, they would consider acceptable in order to achieve political unification. Hopefully these talks will bear fruit and we will see the creation of a pan-Russian state, or at least the pathway to one. And if not, there are always other means by which to continue policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.A;Peace shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.T;The Diplomatic Farce;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.D;Despite the overtures of compromise, talks with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have proven to be little more than a farce! The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats refuse to budge on even the most simple of issues, rejecting reasonable proposals that would ensure our interests are protected. All the while, we have noted that the armies of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have begun to amass along the border. Many in Novgorod believe that these talks were meant as little more than a means by which $FROMCOUNTRY$ could stall in order to adequately mobilize their armies. The situation has recently come to a head, with Novgorodian sailors having been arrested by the soldiers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ for exercising their right to river navigation. With this final insult we refuse to negotiate any further with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Everyone from the coffeehouse intellectual, to the paper-pushing bureaucrat, and even the most pigheaded reactionary now sees that a unified Russia is inevitable. We must strike first and strike hard to ensure that we are the ones to head this new Russian order, and not our enemies in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.A;Let slip the dogs of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.T;A Pro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.D;As we have assumed mastery of the Russian heartland, we are now able to effectively utilize the resources of this rich land to expand our power outwards throughout the rest of Russia. Our first target of conquest is the ancient city of Novgorod, the heart of the Novgorodian Confederation to our north. Having ultimately decided to forego diplomacy with the Novgorodians, we have sent insurgents across the border to attempt to lead a revolution under the guise of a pan-Russian rebellion in order to install a new regime friendly to our cause. Soon we shall know of their results, and whether we will have to openly intervene or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.A;Novgorod will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.T;The Oath at the Holy Wisdom Cathedral;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently attempted to suborn our independence by sending over insurgents in an attempt to overthrow our government. Naturally the majority of them were intercepted before ever reaching the capital, but the fact that they would resort so such means has created fear everywhere that the whole of Russia might soon become subject to the tyrants in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Russian pan-nationalists everywhere call upon Novgorod to take up the mantle of Rurik and fulfil her destiny at unifying Russia. Even within $FROMCOUNTRY$ word reaches us of suppressed uprisings and demonstrations in favor of a Novgorodian-led Russian nation-state. This morning, on the steps of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral in the city of Novgorod, our generals and our soldiers pledged an oath to end the despotic government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and unite the Russian nation under Novgorod much like Rurik did a millennium prior. After kneeling before the metropolitan and receiving his blessing, the armies of Novgorod departed the city and marched south to wage war for the soul of the Russian nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.A;We shall dethrone these tyrants and liberate Russia from their grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.D;The chaos that not long ago plagued the lands of the southern principalities has now reached the people of Novgorod. Already the drums of war sound over the horizon, signaling the arrival of war to the towns and villages that dot the lands of northern Russia. The fate of the entire Russian nation hangs on the outcome of this war. Will $COUNTRY$ unify all of Russia under its rule? Or will Novgorod succeed in asserting its independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.A;The final battle for the fate of all Russia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.T;Victory over Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.D;The armies of Novgorod have been defeated! After nearly a millennium of existence, the Novgorodian Confederation has been vanquished by its external enemies. In its place we have assumed direct control over the former lands of the confederation. The veche has been dissolved and a temporary administration over the city has been set up. There will be much reconciliation to be accomplished between former enemies but one thing remains certain: Russia is now united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.A;And nevermore to be separated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.T;A Devastating Defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.D;Despite outnumbering the forces of Novgorod by a significant margin, our armies proved unable to leverage that advantage in the field. Long supply trains stretching through hostile lands, armies bogged down in the swamps of Novgorod, and attrition from the harsh Russian winter all ensured that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Army remained just the opposite of that. What really won the war for Novgorod, however, was the defeat and capture of an 80,000 strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army by a Novgorodian force less than half its size. With such an embarrassing defeat and the subsequent capture of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general Novgorod has succeeded in forcing us to recognize their status as an independent nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.A;Is a unified Russia destined to remain no more than just a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.D;Early this morning we received a communiqué from Novgorod declaring that a state of war now exists between us and the Novgorodian state. It was less than an hour before further reports started to flood in relating the loss of key positions along our northern border to the advancing armies of Novgorod. The bastards in Novgorod have struck first, and our forces are now in disarray! We must mobilize every man possible to drive back this treacherous enemy, for the fate of the entire nation -- nay, the soul of mother Russia herself -- lies on the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.A;The earth itself trembles as armies march across the fields of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.D;After a long and bitter struggle, we have finally vanquished the treacherous armies of Novgorod. After surviving flood, fire, and enemy for nearly a millennium, it is us who has finally brought an end to the Novgorodian Confederation. With the downfall of Novgorod, the flame of Rurik now passes on to us as the true masters of the Russian nation! Much reconciliation will need to occur between both sides, but one thing remains certain: Russia stands unified under us, never again to be broken apart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.A;Russian unification is finally at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.T;Novgorod Triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.D;For a thousand years our nation has stood and for a thousand years more shall we stand! The armies of the south have been decisively defeated! Against all odds we have come out victorious against our southern neighbor. While there will be much hardship to be had in the future as we rebuild Russia from the ground up, now is a time of jubilation! No longer shall foreigners speak of the Russian principalities in the plural, for now there exists only one Russian nation to speak of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.A;The flame of Rurik guides our path! Onwards to Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.T;An Uneasy Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.D;With both sides having exhausted themselves, diplomats from Novgorod and $COUNTRY$ have come together to negotiate the end of the war. Despite years of conflict, no decisive victory has been won by either side, and in the end what was supposed to be a war to decide the fate of Russia resulted in little more than some minor border changes. Neither side is satisfied with the result but both sides welcome the relief that peace has brought. Already, though, politicians from both sides are calling for the renewal of conflict, and have reasserted the right of each nation to rule over the other. What was ironically termed a treaty of perpetual peace now seems unlikely to last longer than a few years at most. There lies no doubt in anyone's mind that this conflict over the soul of the Russian nation will remain unresolved until one side ceases to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.A;The final battle for Russia has yet to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.T;The Grand Principality Looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.D;Not satisfied with just their hold over central Russia, the Grand Principality of Rus hungrily eyes the lands of the Cossacks to the south. While we would normally be ambivalent to the affairs of the Cossacks, the radical change in the geopolitical situation to our south has demanded our attention. This unified central Russian state poses a major threat to the sovereignty of Novgorod, and given how the Grand Principality of Rus has acted towards the Cossacks one can only imagine their ambitions towards us. It is imperative that we prepare to intervene against the ambitions of this new power in Russia, lest we find ourselves alone to face their might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.A;Mobilize our forces, we must stand ready in the event that they act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.B;We are unconcerned with the affairs of a bunch of illiterate horseback riders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.T;Novgorod Takes Action;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.D;The unification of central Russia has been met with hostility on all sides. It seems the Novgorodians, discontent with the creation of our new state, have begun to act in order to dismember it piecemeal. All along our northern border Novgorodian troop movements have been observed, and word reaches us of a partial mobilization of the Novgorodian army for seemingly inexplicable reasons. If the Novgorodians continue with these acts of aggression we will be forced to act against them in order to preserve our sovereignty. However, we will open talks with the Novgorodians and see what, if anything, can be done to resolve the situation peacefully. Who knows, perhaps we may even be able to extend discussions to the issue of Russian unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.A;We must seek to resolve our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.T;The Future of Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.D;Having noticed the recent movements of our armies, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us seeking to de-escalate the situation. As talks continued, however, the conversation slowly shifted from a simple detente to a discussion regarding the future of Russia. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made it clear that they seek the complete unification of the Russian nation, which naturally includes our great confederation. In many ways we would likely stand to benefit in the event of the creation of a united Russia -- depending upon the form that this new nation would take. For now at least we shall remain receptive to what $FROMCOUNTRY$ has to say, at least until we can discern whether our images for a unified Russia are compatible or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.A;We shall listen to what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.T;Cossackia Rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.D;To our north, the Novgorodians quarrel with the central Russians over who will lead the Russian nation. Little do either of them realize that the true soul of the Russian nation lies south, in the lands of the Cossacks! As the first Russian nation in centuries to truly live free from foreign enslavement, it is in Cossackia where the flame of Rurik burns brightest! It is our sacred duty to intervene in this war and assert our rightful place as hegemon of all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.A;They shall know who the true masters of Russia are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.B;Perhaps we ought to remain out of this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.T;The Invasion of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.D;For weeks now, forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been spotted amassing at the border. While it was initially believed that they were attempting to crack down on Cossack raids, it has quickly become clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends to invade our nation and annex it to their own. However, we are not the weak and disorganized confederation that they believe us to be. We shall turn the tables on them, and as they have come for us so shall we subjugate them! We must mobilize every man available and strike at $FROMCOUNTRY$ before they can do the same to us, else we lose that independence which embodies the Cossack spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.A;These would-be oppressors won’t know what hit ‘em!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.B;Maybe they will leave us alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.T;The Great Trial for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.D;Sensing our vulnerability, the unified Cossack hordes of the south have launched a sneak attack on us in a desperate bid to seize the whole of Russia. With Novgorod attacking from the north and this new front opened up in the south, the Grand Principality of Rus is assailed by enemies on all sides. But no matter! This war for the livelihood and right to sovereignty of our entire nation has galvanized our people into resisting this onslaught. This is nothing less than the great trial thrust upon us by heaven through which all Russia will be baptized by fire! Our people shall rise up and overcome these hardships, forging a new nation from the ashes of our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.A;Arise, men of Russia, and defend your motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1280.T;The Great Trial for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1280.D;Our war with Novogrod has unfortunantly ran into a Nordic Problem. The slavers of Copenhagen have ensured the compliance of Novogrod in a war that shall ultimately ensure our destruction and maintenance of the order that they had built to prevent the rise of the slavs. No matter! This war for the livelihood and right to sovereignty of our entire nation has galvanized our people into resisting this onslaught. This is nothing less than the great trial thrust upon us by heaven through which all Russia will be baptized by fire! Our people shall rise up and overcome these hardships, forging a new nation from the ashes of our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1280.A;Arise, men of Russia, and defend your motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1290.T;The Month of Mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.D;The Princedom of Yaroslavl had been dragged into a medieval dynastic dispute that has resulted into a great loss of life and the further weakening of Yaroslavlian interests in Russia, for nothing. As the overly ambitious Nizhny Novgorod expedition of the Belsky prince ended in bitter failure, the princely family was also struck by disaster as a local smallpox edipedemic ended with Konstantin IV dead along with several of his grandsons. Many had hoped that the prince’s heir could reform and strengthen the state but Paul I ascended the throne in mourning, having lost both his father and his son in the incident and showed little interest in running the state, despite the crucial times. With the head of state retired in his dacha, the autocracy of Yaroslavl could not do anything. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.A;Let us pray for those who left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.T;Rise of the Zemstvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.D;Paul's seclusion led to administrative chaos as the high centralisation wanted by his predecessors backfired due to the Prince's absenteeism. To fund the war, taxes had been raised and corruption had become rampant. The need for reform could not be ignored any further. Parallel institutions grew beside the official administration. In normal times, a Zemtsvo was a provincial assembly mostly made up of nobles and some rich burghers, but sometimes also representatives of serfs and free peasants. While on the outside they presented themselves as charities and cultural circles, offering minimal welfare to the poor, they were the hotbed of opposition to Belsky despotism. Following the Prince’s absence, the Zemtsva spruced up in all towns of the Princedom and began to act in place of the Prince’s agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.A;What is going on in Yaroslavl ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.T;Return of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.D;Prince Paul eventually returned to the political scene after his mourning, with the intent of ruling his state. But he was much surprised by the new state of affairs, despite his new moderate yet still conservative stance. The damage to his authority was huge as the Zemstva had federalised and requested recognition as official institutions of local government. Prince Paul faced a choice : either accept this erosion of his prerogatives or attempt a bold move to deprive the Zemstva of their power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.A;The Prince negotiates with the Zemtsvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.B;The Prince takes action;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.T;The coup succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.D;Paul found himself alone and without political support, and was therefore pressured to ‘peacefully agree’ to sign his abdication without being humiliated. He retreated to one of his countryside mansions, without ever seeing again his son or brother or other members of his family and eventually died due to a firearm wound self-inflicted while trying to make rats flee his bedchamber. His son died of pneumonia, leading to the crowning of Dimitri III Belsky as Prince of Yaroslavl. \n \n He wiped away the Zemstva, persecuting its leaders with secret police and re-establishing the old absolute princely rule. Opposition moved underground and further radicalised, growing closer to marginal intellectual movements advocating emancipation and egalitarianism. The dispossession of many bourgeois, progressive land owners and proto-industrialists staled the princedom's economy, while the political paranoia and rampant reactionarism returned the judicial and administrative system to a paralysed semi-feudal level. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.A;Dimitri rules supreme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.T;The coup backfires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.D;The pro-coup faction was curbed by the opposition of Princess-Dowager Irene, despite her old age and attempts to cut her off from the court. A letter gave Paul a warning of the incoming coup attempt, allowing him to make the first move and save his throne. Prince Dimitri was imprisoned and many co-conspirators were executed for treason. \n \n Prince Paul co-opts new leaders from the administration and military from the most loyal and moderate members of the Zemstva, giving many middle-class members a chance to raise their societal status. The Zemstvo Union is hollowed out and the control of the princely commissioners becomes effective. Prince Paul must, however, accept some limitations to his absolute power and recognise the growing demand for modernisation, especially regarding the issue of serfdom. The Prince grants a small but meaningful constitution and announces the creation of a commission to plan full emancipation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.A;The good ending ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.T;Anarchy on the Volga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.D;Prince Paul and his sons are brutally killed after resisting the proposal of voluntary abdication and the forced removal on the grounds of insanity. Feeling responsible for the action of the rogue troop, Dimitri refuses the crown despite the acclamation by the reactionary faction. \n \n Sensing the collapse of princely authority, the Zemstvo Union coordinates loyalist troops and crushes the reactionary coup. Under the leadership of major romanticist writer Nikolai Druzhinin, the radical intellectuals and the nobles opposing the return in all forms of Belsky despotism joined forces and drafted a constitution loosely based on the Novgorodian customs. The new High Volga Council accepts the formal sovereignty of the Metropolitan of Tver, while a new complicated hierarchy of Zemstva from the village to the national level exercises political power in the most byzantine way imaginable. \n \n The chaos is absolute and some regions rule themselves in almost complete autonomy from Yaroslavl while remnants of the Belsky family raise militias roaming the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.A;A Republic at all costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.T;The Rostov Edicts backfire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.D;Despite the jubilation of the intellectuals, the reaction to the edicts was poor. The serfs, sensing their transformation into individually taxable citizens, feared the loss of collective Mir responsibility, which safeguarded their right to land and house in face of the ever-hungry tax collectors. While emancipation had been silently longed for centuries many did not see the difference between what life would have been before and after. \n \n The Prince attempted to save the situation by strengthening the Mir assemblies and giving them the opportunity to choose communal property and repartition of land, but attacks against government officials checking the emancipation progress became frequent alongside tax dodging. Then the Miry effectively allied with the Zemstva, which offered increasingly tempting services while preserving the old social order. Prince Paul was forced to temporarily, then permanently, stop the reform without even attempting to expand it to boyar-owned serfs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.A;They don’t know what is good for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.T;The Rostov Edicts work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.D;After some hesitation, the Mir assemblies cautiously took the clearly historical step requested by their sovereign. The reform did not fully modernise the way the rural world worked, but already a few months after the Edicts it became clear that things had started to move. \n \n Tensions rose to the highest level when full Emancipation was proclaimed by Prince Paul, including private-owned serfs. The step was probably taken too early and while the boyars were economically crippled they still had the capabilities to oppose this decision. The "court" and the Prince became distant and hostile as the autocrat felt the full burden of despotism and the responsibility of his gamble. The private-owned muzhiks weren't given enough land and the price they had to pay to their former owners was much higher than the tariff asked to state-owned serfs. Nobles and peasants rattled their sabres, but the Prince cautiously integrated new landowners into the Zemstva and the administration, suppressing the oppositions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.A;Divine rule gets things done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.T;The Rostov Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.D;Prince Paul tried to gain time: most of the boyars of the Zemstva were deeply in debt, usually with state-owned banks, which meant they lacked effective control over them as a growing percentage is mortgaged to support their lifestyle. By gaining political power at the expense of the prince they hope to secure their status by emptying the coffers of the State, turning Yaroslavl into a paralysed and isolationist noble republic like Ryazan and the Commonwealth. \n \n Keeping faith to the unbroken alliance with his people, the Prince knew it was his to duty to guide all his subjects towards a better future. Thus he promulgated the Rostov Edicts which ordered the immediate emancipation of all state-owned serfs. The most important measure is the new power of the Mir (village) assemblies of former state Muzhiks to divide a generous percentage of the land under their jurisdiction between the peasant households, based on family size. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.A;The Prince knows what is good for his subjects!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.T;The Prince's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.D;Prince Paul attempted to gain the reins of the Zemstva by imposing the tutelage of a Prince-appointed commissioner and by making some of the welfare activities offered by the Zemstva a service offered by the state. But administrative efficiency remained low and the new competences taken from the Zemstva make it even harder for the state to administrate. It led to growing hatred toward the Prince among the lowest class, which had had hopes for better standards of living thanks to these services. Discontent also grew in the Belsky family, as cousins and brothers of Paul became convinced that he had become irreparably unfit for rule after the death of his son and his actions were destroying the legitimate authority in Yaroslavl. Dimitri, Paul's brother, was asked by reactionary generals and nobles to lead a coup to imprison and depose his brother and become regent for the young Alexey, Paul's son. Dimitri accepted but the divisions within the Belsky family make the coup attempt less smooth than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.A;A ... coup ??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.T;The vision of Mikhail;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.D;Michael II Repnin has managed to bring back Ryazan to power and unify the Central Russian Lands as no ruler has ever done in the history of Russia. Curtailing the Boyars? powers, their rich estates are now worked in the name of the state. The rich lands of the South now feed the ever growing population of the Grand Principality. With soldiers loyal to him and his ideals of a Russia master of the steppe and thus her destiny, he now turns his eyes south to the Cossack and Tatar lands in which he will forge a new nation upon the ashes of her old enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.T;The realm of the Boyars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.D;The Boyars of Ryazan have withstood the problems caused by Michael II Repnin and held on their prerogatives in power. In the wars that followed, Ryazan emerged victorious, the Duma now becoming the main power responsible for Central Russia. Serfdom still is an important piece of the nation, and it has been used to fuel unprecedented population growth thanks to the rich lands from the South that the peasants from all Russia will now toil in. The aristocracy that guides the new unified Prince of the Rus knows where its interests lie. It is not in Northern Russia, filled with radicals and idealists that the Russian nation will be forged, but in the open lands of the South where lands only demand for the boyars to come and exploit them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.A;For the true nobility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.T;The expansion of the Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.D;The Vozhd of Smolensk rules over the unified Union of Muscovy, contemplating the efforts done in the former years. Inefficient rule of the Assemblies has been sidelined as Smolensk and the whole of Russia needed a strong but benevolent hand. And who but to lead the rising Russian nation but the Vozhd of the People ? Soldiers have been sent to educate the former serfs who are now armed to vanquish the foes of the Vozhd. Boyar rule has ended in central Russia but it is not enough. For the true Slavic nation to appear, blood will need to be spilled as the archaic and free Northerners and Cossacks must be subjugated and learn true Russian Narodnost !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.A;We follow the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.T;Russian Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.D;The Smolenskan Confederation that emerged from the independence has survived and achieved a transition into a Muscovite Confederation ruling over all of Central Russia. Many sought to extinguish the light that emerged in the West, preferring to keep the masses in serfdom and ignorance. But our Republic knows better, it is the era of the masses and we hear the lamentations from our cousins in the North and South who look up to us to realize the ideals of Freedom and Equality in the lands of the Rus. The road ahead will be tough, but a new Nation shall arise, one that will not repeat the mistakes of the past and unify the Slavic people of the East under one flag and one rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#CRUS80.T;A stable principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.D;The enlightened rule of the Prince of Smolensk and his advisors in the Duma has maintained balance between the ideals of the West and the traditions from Russia. Only Smolensk could modernize Russia without upsetting what made the Russian identity. Masses are now being enlightened by their betters as it should be and while the worst Boyars have been deprived of their powers, all recognize the necessary role of the aristocracy in guiding the Grand Principality. Now the armies of the Rus must march once again to forge a new Slavic Nation in the East, against the unruly Cossacks and the archaic Novgorodians !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.A;Modernity will not sweep all traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.T;The Tsarina looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.D;The Grand Principality of Rus has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod. The grand princess Anna Lyapunova now rules alone over Central Russia, having reconquered her home and beyond while reforming the lands she holds. Boyars are now curtailed by the ever-growing state apparatus while the masses celebrate the ?tsarina?, a title evocating the brief rule of Ivan III and Zoe Palaiologos with whom the Princess has cultivated various ties. With her position secured and the support of the Russian people, Anna looks east and south across the steppes to acquire the land necessary to forge a new nation that could rise to the occasion and become a leading power in the East. Soon the glory of the Tsarina will be discussed over all Europe and all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.A;Long live Anna 'The Mother of Russia'!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.T;The Bear on the march;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.D;The Union of Muscovy has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod, with the Generallisimo Talantsev at her helm. The general has won over the support of the masses of whole Central Russia despite his foreign origins and lowly rank. The old hierarchies have been swept away as the Talantsev squadrons began to apply the new order across the Union. It is time now to look further than the current borders : the Volga has been the blood of Nizhny Novgorod for all its existence and shall become along with the Don the source of the new Russian Nation, as the Tatars are pacified and the lands christianized under the helm of the greatest conqueror the Russians have ever known! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.A;Long live Talantsev! For a more glorious Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.T;The Autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.D;Konstantin IV of Iaroslav has vanquished his enemies and reclaimed the legacies of Ivan III, Dimitri I and Feodor II ! An autocrat now rules over the unified Grand Principality of Rus, and never has it been such needed ! The nobility and the clergy needed to be reminded of their subservience to their sovereign while the masses had grown desperate at the hands of unworthy masters. Now the Autocrat sees all and balances the needs of the states justly. But it is only the beginning : soon a new nation will rise from the ashes of the old Russia and it only needs to bend the old Republic of Novgorod to the command of Konstantin to truly rule all the Russias. Then the Russian Crown shall look further west and south to begin the new power of Europe and Asia under the benevolent rule of the only one legitimate sovereign !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS150.T;The Polish Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.D;Now that the wars have ended and Moscow has reunited the old Grand-Duchy of Vladimir and Muscovy, the place of Stanislaw Habsburg has only strengthened. His role in the war, notably his success in leading the charge that gave the final victory over the Belskys of Yaroslavl have made him popular with the soldiery, and he has been given a lavish palace who belonged to the Prince of Nizhny Novgorod as a reward. However, his Liberal stance and his criticism of the Boyars’ rule have attracted him many enemies in court. Moreover, he has not abandoned his Catholic faith and has already clashed with the Patriarch of Moscow several times. Already a pamphlet has been issued anonymously, calling him a Trojan horse of Poland, and calling for all ‘faithful Russians’ to remember the damage the Polish kings brought during the Smuta. The Grand-Prince has already censored the work but many wonder what place Stanislaw will occupy in the new Russia that is being made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.A;He is a national hero for God’s sake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.T;A Threat from Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.D;The escape and then subsequent banishment of Stanislaw Habsburg from Poland was seen by most of the Sejm as the most logical course of action. When they heard he had fled to his brother-in-law in Moscow, most thought they’d never hear of him again. But news from his actions during the Muscovite Wars have been the main focus of many newspapers in Warsaw and the rest of the Commonwealth, notably his heroic charge against the Prince of Yaroslavl. Now the Sejm grows alarmed : Moscow has united and seeks to unite ‘Russia’, a country that wishes to take our lands and people. With Stanislaw at the helm of their armies, who knows what the radicals could do ? Already people discuss a possible split of the Commonwealth between Stanislaw and his brother-in-law and that has made even the most reluctant members of the Sejm agree to rally against our new neighbour : We shall ask them to banish Stanislaw and give back any land that belonged to the Commonwealth, notably Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.A;Send the ultimatum to Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.B;Remember Wladyslaw and the Troubles? We can’t attack Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.T;The Commonwealth Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.D;To the utter astonishment of our entire government, the Commonwealth has become so overwhelmed by its own arrogance that it has seen fit to deliver a demand to us : hand Stanislaw and Smolensk over to them, or face war! From our spies in their nation, it seems that the specter of Stanislaw leading a Muscovite army into the Commonwealth has become too agonizing for them to bear, and so it has driven them to this act of incredible rashness. Our cabinet is almost unanimous in agreeing that to obey this directive would be an intolerable humiliation, yet can we afford to face war when Russia is still not yet unified? We have still not healed from the wars by which Great Russia was united. To face the Commonwealth now, with the question of the north still unanswered, could jeopardize our entire program of Russian unification. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.A;Reply with a single word : "No!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.B;Stanislaw and Smolensk must be sacrificed for the good of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS153.T;Reply of the Muscovite Velikorussians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS153.D;While we had anticipated a lack of cooperation from the Muscovites, few of us ever expected them to reply with such laconic conciseness. A messenger from Muscovy arrived before the Sejm and made a grand display of flourishing a letter replying to our ultimatum, sealed with the sign of the Muscovite ruler, and then addressed him by his long, formal, ostentatious title. However, once the letter was finally unsealed and read, the entire Sejm was astounded at its contents : merely a single word, “No!” At this point the Sejm burst into outrage, with hundreds of nobles demanding the messenger be seized and brutalized for the insult. While several soldiers intervened and escorted the messenger away – for immediate deportation – much of the Sejm is furious that the Muscovites would not only defy us but do so in such a flippant and petulant manner. For the first time in memory, the Sejm’s opinion is united : war with Muscovy is the only way to recover our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS153.A;We shall march Stanislaw back in chains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS154.T;The Muscovite Catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS154.D;Despite all of the hardships that we endured, despite all of the sacrifices which we made for the good of Russia, despite all of our hopes, aspirations, and dreams of a people united with a strength not seen since the days of the Kievan Rus’, the Commonwealth has trampled our ambitions beneath the hooves of their winged hussars. With our armies shattered in the field and the government in chaos, Stanislaw was rooted out of hiding and brought back to the Commonwealth for whatever dark fate they have planned for him. Already the Commonwealth is laying out the peace terms they seek to impose upon us, each one another dagger into our chest. As our domestic politics inch closer and closer to the abyss, the first flames of a political explosion beginning to flare up, many of our people wonder : has all of our work been for nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS154.A;Perhaps we were not meant to save Russia after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1540.T;The Stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1540.D;The struggle between ourselves and the Muscovites has strewn carnage across eastern Europe, yet neither side has been able to win a convincing victory - we have fought each other to mutual exhaustion. A bitter peace of status quo ante bellum has been signed with Muscovy, who is technically the victor of this war, whatever a term like that means at this point. As the peoples of both our nation and theirs turn with newly critical eyes towards their rulers, who drove them to sacrifice so much on their behalf, the halls of power in Warsaw and Moscow are filled with fear for the future. Stanislaw remains in Moscow, but at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS155.T;The Muscovite Triumph;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS155.D;A cataclysm has befallen the Commonwealth. The armies of the Muscovites proved overwhelming, and our attempt to pressure them diplomatically has reaped the bitterest of harvests. With our forces broken and the government in chaos, the Sejm’s resolve quickly faltered and they hurriedly agreed to a long list of Muscovite demands simply to save their own hides. The nation lies burning, as the nobles have once more covered their assets by throwing the country to the wolves at the door. Already news is spreading of the peace terms which the Sejm consented to in order to halt the Muscovite march, each one another knife in our backs. Is this the beginning of the Commonwealth’s end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS155.A;Perhaps this union was not meant to endure after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.T;Anarchy in Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.D;The loss of not only Stanislaw, but the entirety of Smolensk, to the Commonwealth has plunged the nation into a level of disorder not seen since the Time of Troubles. Wild-eyed prophets roam the countryside, proclaiming the end of days, while furious boyars denounce the Tsar with a bitterness that would’ve been seen as blasphemy before this crisis began. The chief critic is none other than the Patriarch of Moscow himself, who has begun to question the Tsar’s very fitness to rule! Worse, news is spreading of efforts by several influential boyars to build support for an aristocratic coup against the Tsar. If we want to halt this crisis, extreme measures are needed. Two radical suggestions have been put forward by the Tsar’s advisors : either convert to Unitarianism – which would, at least, deprive the Patriarch of his authority over the Tsar’s government – or organize a massive payout of bribes to the most powerful boyars of the nation. What shall be done to save Muscovy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.A;May Vladimir forgive us, for we must forsake his will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.T;Boyars are greedy men, gold shall satisfy them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.T;The Patriarch's Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.D;Our efforts to thwart the mobilization of the clergy and the boyars against the Tsar have failed. With public animosity towards the throne finally boiling over, the charismatic and reactionary Patriarch Dmitry of Moscow has decided to take matters into his own hands. A coalition of boyars led an army into Moscow late last night, overpowering the city guards and heading straight to the Moscow Kremlin. Quickly fighting their way inside, they escorted Patriarch Dmitry into the bedroom of the Tsar. Dmitry then anathematized the Tsar for his “degradation of Muscovy, his grievous injuries to the Russian people,” and his “failures to uphold, honor, and obey the will of the Most Holy God.” The anathematized Tsar was dragged to a hastily convened Zemsky Sobor within the Kremlin’s walls, in which the Tsar was officially deposed, and Patriarch Dmitry coronated Dmitry I of the Holy Muscovite Patriarchate. The Tsar may have failed the Russian people, but Patriarch Dmitry, backed by the boyars and guided by God, shall not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.A;Slava Dmitry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.T;Continued Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.D;It seems that not even Patriarch Dmitry could bring instantaneous stability to Muscovy. The disestablishment of the monarchy has greatly aggravated the situation of the countryside. Rural villages, whom the clergy have told for generations that the monarch was God’s primary agent on Earth, have reacted poorly to the news that God’s will shall now be executed by the Patriarch instead. Many have begun to withhold taxes, to the point of violently attacking army units sent to escort tax collectors. Worse, certain religious cults are cropping up as people slander the holy name of Dmitry and accuse him of perverting the will of God! But both problems pale in comparison to the reaction of urban elites and intelligentsia, who have denounced the Patriarch and his seizure of power with unrestrained fury. Cities across the nation have become hotbeds of resistance, with protests and even small riots practically a daily occurrence. The situation is only growing worse with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.A;"Yet though I walk in the shadow of the valley of death...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.T;An Uneasy Calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.D;So far, it appears that Patriarch Dmitry’s swift removal of the Tsar has thrown the opponents of the regime into confusion. Unable to coordinate their opposition, resistance has been limited to various isolated incidents. Yet this may be merely the calm before the storm, as our domestic patrols indicate that unrest may be rising in both the cities and the countryside. For now it seems that all we can do is wait and hope that Muscovy shall finally know peace once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.A;Whatever happens, God shall provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.T;Protests in Every City!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.D;Our worst fears have been confirmed : the calm of the last few weeks was illusory. Over the past few days, liberals and dissatisfied boyars have ignited protests across Muscovy. In almost every major city, crowds have marched through the streets, shouting their denunciation of the government and its failure to address their needs or find an effective foreign policy. Not only have the urban elite stirred their followers up, but even in the countryside, rural communities have begun to fortify their villages, as peasant collectives begin to become more and more like armed camps. Collecting taxes has now gained the occupational hazard of rifle fire from defiant peasants. Law and order is on the verge of breaking down in Muscovy, and there are really only two options if Dmitry wants to maintain power : call out the army and lock down the nation, or gamble his popularity on a massive campaign to unite Russia by fire and sword. If he succeeds in the latter, his name shall be blazed into the heavens. If he fails…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS161.T;The Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.D;Dmitry, Patriarch of Moscow and now ruler of Muscovy, has seen his popularity erode precipitously over the last few weeks. With protests sweeping the nation, he has decided to wage one last desperate campaign to bring all of what he considers the “natural lands of Russia” under his rule. Muscovite armies are now bearing down upon us, and we must make ready to defend ourselves from these mad legions of fanatics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.A;If they seek martyrdom, then we are happy to oblige!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.T;The Great Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.D;With the holy armies of Muscovy now fully assembled, Patriarch Dmitry has given them a benediction. “Loyal sons of Muscovy, sons of Russia, faithful men of God! Before us lies the land of our ancestors, the primordial earth of the Rus’, where our forefathers forged a mighty nation. Yet mighty as she was, her sons did not preserve her, and so squandered their inheritance. For ages, Russia has laid sleeping, unaware of her children’s condition. But now, Russia stirs! She awakes to find herself in the light of God, her strength returning to her. As she draws her sword, she is not alone. She marches to battle with every man and woman in Muscovy who keeps the love of God and the glory of His son, Jesus Christ, in their hearts!” The Patriarch makes a sweep with his hand, towards the horizon. “There, my sons, lies Russia! There lies this ancient, long-slumbering land, this realm of warriors that yearns for one nation, one faith. In the name of most holy God, I implore you : be the instruments of her salvation!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.A;AMEN! §R(DECLARE WAR ON ALL RUSSIAN AND TATAR STATES)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.T;Holy Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, a few blasphemous fools dared to question his wisdom, claiming that God would not protect us as he has done for ages. Once again, however, the doubters have been shamed and shown the error of their ways, and God’s will has triumphed. All of Russia is now under Muscovite hegemony, and the road to unification has never been clearer. Throughout the land – throughout all Russian lands – people are beginning to finally understand Patriarch Dmitry’s role as God’s foremost messenger, and pay him the praise which has been so long overdue. With Russian unity now only a matter of time, the faithful may rest assured that Russia shall retain its holy Christian character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.A;God truly was and is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.T;The Destiny of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, most thought him mad, and saw the war as nothing more than the last desperate act of a power-hungry tyrant. It seems, however, that fate found it a more delicious cruelty to humor his delusions by granting him victory. With the hordes of zealous Muscovites rampaging through our lands, the issue of our place within the future Russian order has, apparently, already been determined. Our only hope is that they shall prove more benevolent masters in peace than in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.A;God help us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.T;The End of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.D;The clocks of Moscow all strike midnight, as a messenger dashes through the city gates. Weaving past rows of field hospitals, through alleys full of tense soldiers, he proceeds to the Kremlin, a dire message in hand. Finally receiving admittance, he approaches the monarch’s quarters to deliver the news : the last Muscovite army has been broken. But, he does not deliver his message – there is nobody to deliver it to. God has called the leader of Muscovy home, and he lies dead, sprawled upon the floor, his Bible still open to the Book of Revelations. \n\n The end of our national stability, and the news of sovereign’s death, has spelled the collapse of Muscovy. Boyars have given up on the central government and contacted local generals to declare their own petty realms. As foreign powers swoop in upon the Muscovite corpse, the conclusion of nearly all observers is that Muscovy has lost any chance of unifying Russia. Time will tell if another state will take up the task but for the time being, Russia is lost once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.A;Life, a series of increasing sufferings, flies further and further towards its end—the most terrible suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.T;Muscovy Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.D;Muscovy as we knew it is no more. All of the lands which it claimed in its quest to unify Russia have broken away, steered onto new courses by ambitious boyars and generals. Perhaps we shall write the next chapter of Russia's history?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.A;Total freedom, with all the horror it entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.T;Peace Returns to Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.D;The dire prophecies of pessimists both foreign and domestic have failed to be born out, as the Muscovite ship of state once more crests the waves. Protests have begun to fade into minor complaints, the peasants have returned to their work, and the boyars have accepted the new order. Yet while collapse has been averted, the future of the nation is still unclear. Some believe that Dmitry’s best bet to ensure long-term stability is to reconcile with right-wing members of the Lyapunovs, crowning a suitably pious conservative as the new Tsar and returning to spiritual duties. Others believe that the radical cause has merely gone underground, and is in fact poised to strike at the heart of Muscovite power and seize control. Still others hold that Muscovy’s future lies in building consensus and establishing a balance of power between the estates. Finally, hardcore Orthodox Christians encourage Dmitry to maintain his position as head of state. In the end…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS168.D;The Commonwealth has finally managed to overcome all political obstacles and centralize itself into a modern nation state. While this would be problematic enough for our foreign policy, they have not contented themselves with organizing their domestic politics, but have pursued an ambitious and aggressive policy abroad. This has now been taken to the most dire extreme, as the Commonwealth has declared that the “situation in Muscovy” is “no longer acceptable,” and have proclaimed their intent to “reorganize the region” through nothing less than a campaign of brutal subjugation! Already the Commonwealth’s legions are marching towards us, hellbent on shattering our nation and ending the threat of Russian unification. As the hoofbeats of their winged hussars begin to echo in the ears of our border guards, Muscovy faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This victory shall surely further our reputation as the rightful unifiers of Russia, and draw outlying states to our cause.

NRUS1.T;Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.D;Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS2.D;The Vyatka Republic is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs but Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws. Vyatka is a peculiar case of political integration, as Udmurt, Mari and Komi people live within its borders and enjoy a certain degree of citizenship rights. However, They are still treated as second-class citizens, despite their almost complete conversion to Orthodoxy. The Uralic people of the republic have petitioned the local Veche to abolish some long standing norms like discriminatory legislation for land ownership and military conscription. The spokesman of this group is Yevgeny Blinov, a russified Udmurt noble and patron of the first Udmurt publishing house, his wealth has attracted many Vyatkan officials to his side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS5.D;The news of the integration of Uralic peoples in the Vyatkan Republic has created a negative reaction in Novgorod. While Karelians and other Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows. The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax and challenge the colonial attitude some colonists harbor towards the Uralic people. The northern volosts have asked the Veche how to deal with this large minority who have heard of the new Vyatkan laws. A new conscription law is proposed as a replacement for the yasak, which would establish Komi and Nenets units as military reserves and assistants for frontier outposts and isolated garrisons. Tyko Verigin, a representative of Samoyedic origin from the volost of Arkhangelsk, also proposes to give Uralic chieftains and elders the right to join local administrative assemblies, giving them a voice in the administration of their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.A;Savages do not deserve rights;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.B;The Conscription law strikes a compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.C;Rights are granted to the Uralics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.T;News from Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.D;Our new laws of integration for the Uralic peoples have created quite a stir in Novgorod, for the Veche has reaffirmed the discriminatory laws that we abolished. While autonomous, we still bow to Lord Novgorod the Great and keeping our laws could be poorly seen in the capital. On the other hand, it would be easy enough to write a sham law that would appease the republic while keeping the rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.A;We bow to our Lord of course…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.B;Our rewriting means nothing, we assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.T;Udmurt unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.D; Our refusal to grant rights to the Uralic people have created unrest within our small republic. The Udmurts and Mari living in Vyatka have started to resent the increasing discrimination caused by the harsh rejection of Blinov's proposals and strange rumors come from their territories, talking of seditions and troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.A;They can revolt. We are stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.T;Blinov's insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.D;The Udmurts have declared independence under the guidance of Blinov! A Confederation similar to the Mari has been  formed, with a political structure based on the democratic institutions of Vyatka. At the same time, the Udmurts reject envoys from Vyatka and have started harassing Russian garrisons. Many Russians in the countryside are escaping north or west, although those living in urban centers have been granted full rights. Vyatka must rally the various garrisons and march East to avoid a complete collapse of their authority in the hinterlands. Envoys have also been sent to Novgorod to ensure we get reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.A;Pesky Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.T;News from Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.D;Worrying news has reached us from our subjects in Vyatka. The small republic is facing an insurrection launched by the Udmurt tribes, who have grown resentful of the discrimination they face in their lands. They ask us for our support in quelling the rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.A;We will march against the Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.B;It is too costly to commit troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.T;War in Udmurtia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.D;The War against the Udmurts has been raging for several weeks already, and many fear that the Vyatkans aren’t strong enough to take care of this threat on their own. Following a rowdy session in the Veche and Council of Lords, it has been decided to send several regiments to the East to end the troubles and secure our trade again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.A;The forests will burn if needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.T;Defeat in the Votyak War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.D;As the Udmurts have secured their territory and defeated the platoons sent to defeat them, the Novgorodian Republic has been forced to recognize their independence to avoid any more financial losses. The defeat in the Votyak War proves the disastrous condition of the Novgorodian army and the administrative chaos of the confederation, which couldn't resist the uprising of mere disgruntled peasants. Valuable territory has been lost and communication with the Ural territories has become more difficult, as Novgorodians envoys and merchants must circumvent Udmurt territory to avoid customs or harassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.A;What has happened to us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.T;Victory in the Votyak war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.D;The Udmurts have been vanquished and their territory has been reintegrated into the republic. The end of the Votyak War proved that Novgorod still has an army capable of ensuring control of the confederation's territory, although many still doubt the capability of its leaders in the case of an actual conflict. The exile of Yevgeny Blinov and the closure of his publishing house has radicalised the few Uralic intellectuals, which along with rogue chieftains continued to stir unrest in the region long after the end of the uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.A;Nonetheless, it’s a victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.T;Fate of Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.D;Novgorod must decide what to do with Vyatka. The Vyatkan Veche has been replaced by a military authority, people flee westward and the economy is in shambles. Routes towards Siberia move northwards outside the territory of the Republic, the Vyatka river is too dangerous to navigate and the ironworks facilities are either in Udmurt territory or are being dismantled to be rebuilt in the Urals, where now they are more profitable. Two options are proposed: Vyatka would be reorganised under a military government becoming a stronghold against the attacks coming from the Tatars and the Uralic tribes or the Vyatkan Veche would be restored as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.A;The military takes control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

NRUS16.T;The Wanderer's Handbook;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS16.D;”I went silent as this nobleman praised the institution of serfdom and the lack of worries the serfs enjoy. ‘The serf is the happiest man in Russia’ he told me. But I thought, as they do not feel worries, they can not possess families, feel affection, happiness or grasp other moral sentiments. They possess nothing, not even their life, and thus any of the natural rights that were unearthed after centuries of despotism by our philosophers” \n \n The son of a Novgorodian merchant in the Russian quarter of Copenhagen, Leonid Vorontsov, has published in Copenhagen a fictionalised voyage diary of a trip from Nyenschantz to Vologda based on his own first visit to his motherland, describing the inhuman living conditions of the Russian serfs. His work widely translated has also started again the debate on serfdom in Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS16.A;At least this book is only sold abroad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.T;The Serfdom debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.D;Novgorod is a collection of different political entities that have different legislations, especially regarding serfdom. Some countries or regions don't have it, like Yugra or the Pomor lands. Some have normal serfdom, like Novgorod’s core territory, and some have a very conservative and harsh serfdom similar to the southern princedoms, like Galich and Beloozero. There has been no major evolution in serfdom legislation for at least fifty years, but the percentage of serfs has been steadily increasing, as is the number of escapees to free territories.The debate launched by Vorontsov’s book has led to the abolitionists clamoring for the Veche and Council of Lords to take a stance on the matter. The main problem comes from the stark opposition between the Council of the Lords that oppose any law proposal, and the leader of the Veche, the Posadnik, Konstantin Levashov who has decided to push for an harsher abolitionist stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.A;Let them debate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.T;The first draft;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.D;The Veche has debated for several days the idea of a unified Muzhikate Code that would make the laws of the city of Novgorod concerning serfdom effective throughout the entire Confederation. Widely seen as a compromise as it doesn’t abolish serfdom and even could restrict some freedoms enjoyed in the northern territories or volotsks, it has drawn the opposition of the Posadnik who wants the Muzhikate Code to be amended by restoring old laws, especially the tradition that allowed serfs to leave their masters on the day of Saint Yuri. Regardless of the amendment, the law will go to the Council of Lords, that will oppose any form of Muzhikate Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.A;The first draft it is;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.B;Draft the amendment into the Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.T;The Muzhikate Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.D;The Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche has been accepted by the Council of Lords despite its members relying on serfdom for their wealth and position. Many believe this outcome to result from popular discontent towards serfdom along with the realization by some noblemen that gradual reform is better if they hope to keep power in the long run. Nonetheless, this law, while quite minor, will better the lives of the serfs in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.A;A small step;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.T;The Levashov Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.D;To the surprise of many, the Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche and amended at the demand of the Posadnik has passed through the Council of Lords. No one really knows how the game was played, or the reasons behind it, but rumours talk about how the Posadnik would have bribed and threatened the members of the Council thanks to citizen bands loyal to him. While the law will improve the status of serfs in the confederation, this move has greatly angered the boyars and the princes of Beloozero and Galich who now begin to scheme together and fragment the Republic even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.A;A victory, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.T;Veto from the Nobles;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.D;While the Boyars of Novgorod do not possess a power as great as the Slazchta in the Commonwealth, the Council of Lords can veto proposals from the Veche. Unsurprisingly, the draft demanding better living conditions for the serfs has been refused. While crowds have gathered to voice their anger towards the boyars leaving the Yaroslavl palace, there isn’t much that can be done to revert their decision. Only one person can act: the prince, but many fear that his senility will lead to the same result or worse. The law can also be abandoned: abolitionism while an important political debate in Novgorod is not shared enough amongst the wealthy and educated to be worth basing a political career on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.A;Postpone any further debates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.B;Ask the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.T;The refusal of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.D;Simeon Yemin was already old when he was elected to be Prince of Novgorod. But as years go by, his role, already weak in the political circles of Novgorod, has become one of a symbolic figure that appears in front of crowds, presides over some ceremonies and signs the necessary papers from his seat in the Yaroslavl palace in the centre of the city. Many claim the old man is insane or senile, while the ones who are close to him say that it is a façade he has built over the years to be tranquil. No matter what the truth is, the Veche's representatives have regretted asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince refused to overrule the decision of the Lords and then shouted at the Posadnik that he had interrupted his afternoon rest. With this peculiar event, the hopes of the abolitionists have been crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.T;The Most Glorious Code!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veche’s representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince not only accepted to overrule the decision of the Lords. He promulgated the Code with the Amendment, and praised the text to be the Most Glorious Code of the Republic. The nobles heavily criticized the prince, as many saw it as another proof of his lunacy and his influenceable state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veche’s representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The prince agreed to overrule the decision of the Lords if the text said that the law was passed on his initiative. While discontent with this state, nobles hardly could express anger as this was seen as one of the strange acts the prince performed and made him quite popular by many in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS24.A;Glory to the Prince, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.T;A speech at the university;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.D;For the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Novgorodian University, the President of the Fur Traders Guild Artemy Trediakovsky was invited for a speech. The Fur Traders Guild has been a major philanthropic and political association involved in all kinds of cultural and economical affairs for decades. Fur trade is now only one of the many economic activities of the guild, whose main focus has become the promotion of modern industrial culture and the opening of the Republic to the West. He talked for an hour and proclaimed that the city of Novgorod was the door to the West for all of Russia and that the right path for the Republic was the "enlightening marvels along the Narva''. He condemned the "mirages of the ancient times", that only had to offer "another thousand years of toiling" for Russian peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.A;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.T;Meanwhile in the Ural...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.D;On the other side of the country, far away from the comforts of the city, the Yugrian Confederation administers the lands of the eastern frontier. A federation of Cossack hosts, monastic communes, fortified villages and barely loyal Uralic tribes. Its only role is to protect Novgorod and its trade concerns from the raids of the Siberians. What was once was a barely cultivable territory plundered by slave raids and migrating hordes has recently started to become one of the richest territories in the Union. The Ural Mountains have become a major center of extraction for metals and coal, giving every man the opportunity to become rich if he's willing enough to toil in the mines or haul the goods to the Russian river network along dangerous routes. Most of the trade, especially fur, comes from Siberian tributaries or trade routes across the Perm pass, which is administered by the Fur Guild. This has of course caused many problems for Yugran traders, who are forced to pay a large tariff despite having moved within their own territory and often rely on contraband.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.A;And the problem is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.T;The Guild concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.D;The Fur Trade Guild has formally petitioned the Veche to legislate on the transit of goods crossing the Urals, following a loss of income as Yugran traders use contraband to circumvent their monopoly. This demand has been met with surprisingly large opposition as hostile guilds, representatives of the Yugran territories and even members of the clergy have united against the backward proposal that would create further barriers within the union and concentrate even more power in the hands of a few merchants in the city of Novgorod. The Fur Guild which funds half the liberal associations of Novgorod find themselves having to rely on their political enemies to protect their lucrative monopoly. In the Veche three proposals emerge: the first law would confirm Guild privileges, expand the number of border patrols and enforce the tariff. The second law would create a competitive market for the Guilds and the Yugran traders. Finally, the "Laptev Amendment'', proposed by a representative from Arkhangelsk asks for the creation of a national Siberian Fur Trade Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.A;The Guild shall keep its privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.B;Let the free market decide!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.C;Nationalize the fur trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.T;Monopoly confirmed by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.D;The Fur Trade Guild’s proposal has reached the Council of Lords, and was passed into law. Now the Guild has received the authorization to monitor the passes of the East and keep a close eye on Siberian trade. While a great move for the urban bourgeoisie of Novgorod, the law would create resentment in the East, and would provoke years of unrest and smuggling in Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.A;Let the furs... flow?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.T;Monopoly rejected by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.D;Surprisingly the Council of Lords has rejected the Veche proposal of confirming their monopoly and privileges. Many thought that the aristocracy would support the urban bourgeois since it would benefit them in the end, but past grudges between the two groups were too strong to overcome. It has become clear to the Veche, that Guild privileges have gone too far and that the riches of the Novgorodian eastern lands are being left unsold due to useless ancient privileges. The creation of a modern trading company, as proposed by the Laptevs, which may kickstart Novgorodian economy, gains support in the assembly despite the risk of angering one of the most powerful political groups in the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.A;The status quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.B;Let us petition the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.T;The Prince does nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.D;Years have done their work on Simeon Yumin who seems hardly fit to rule anymore. When the Veche representatives reached him, the old man refused to receive them because it would interrupt his sleeping habits, and only after one aide convinced him to host them, he decided to welcome them in his quarters. His response was as harsh as his first words had been: the amendment would not receive any support from him as he respected the traditions of Novgorod. The status quo will leave a bitter stain in Novgorodian politics as the Yugrans often continue to fight against the Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.T;The Prince supports the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.D;Years have done their work on the Prince of Novgorod, but he is still involved in Novgorodian politics. Following the proposal of the Veche to create a national Siberian Fur Trade Company, the Prince would decide to pass the Laptev amendment into law. While a profitable endeavor for the Republic, this action would necessitate heavy compensation to the Fur Guild who was to be absorbed by the Company and anger the aristocracy who had been sidelined.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.A;Thank you, old man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.T;A surprising action;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.A;A great move, but was it deliberate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.T;Free trade of furs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, de facto creating a competitive market in Siberia. The move greatly angered the Fur Guild who was nonetheless compensated for the loss of privileges, and it did not change much in the Novgorodian economy as the Guild was the main entrepreneur and still dominated the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.A;A wasted opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.T;Refusal from the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, which would have created a competitive market in Siberia. The only person capable of ending this deadlock is the ailing Prince of Novgorod, but members of the Veche have expressed preference to letting the status quo endure rather than having to face his unpredictable temper. The Veche could also ask the Prince for approval of a modified and moderate version of the law which also contains parts of the original Laptev Amendment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.A;Leave the old man alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.B;Go to the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.T;The Prince follows the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.D;The prince’s involvement has resulted in the moderate version being promulgated into law. Nothing noteworthy changes in Novgorod following this legislation and the Guild and its supporters consider themselves very offended by the recent attacks. No one is happy about this arrangement, as the Guild still retains an important power in Yugra and the rest of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.A;A waste of time and money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.T;The Prince enforces status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.D;The Prince has enforced the status quo concerning the Ural passes and tariffs, angering the Yugrian traders. Moreover it has led to new expenses for border forts in the East. Nothing noteworthy changes as the independent merchants continue to struggle against the Guild which is itself angered by the attacks it suffered in the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.A;Unity in Novgorod is no simple task...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.T;The decision of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.A;A surprise, but a good one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.T;The Lords refuse the Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.D;The Veche has asked for the creation of a Siberian fur trade company, only to have the Council of Lords reject the proposal. Debates are still going though, as Aristemy Laptev gathers several witnesses and various supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.A;What will happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.T;The Semyonov testimony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.D;Aristemy Laptev has taken the opportunity brought by the ongoing debate to denounce the unlawful practices of the Fur Merchants Guild, exposing their unlawful treatment of Novgorodian citizens in the north and in Siberian lands and blaming them for the misery of these naturally rich territories. The testimony of Vasily Semyonov, a Yugrian fur trader who lost an eye following an attack by Guild agents shook the assembly to the core. In the chaos of the revelation, a group of radical representatives in the Veche has started an overall attack against Guild privileges of all kinds, asking for the abolition of many ancient rights that hamper Novgorod's ascent into modernity, or so they claim. The Veche representatives must now propose either the dissolution of all the guilds or just focus on ending the Fur Trade Guild and then pass the proposal for the Prince for approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.A;The Veche votes on the dissolution of all Guilds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.B;The Veche only targets the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.T;Dissolution of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.D;Given the guilds' sudden infamy and the discovery of serious cases of corruption, the Prince easily accepted the Veche’s proposal and the backlash was limited. Many guilds eventually resurfaced as enterprises or associations within a solidified free market. The Novgorodian system has changed for the better according to many, and has become more western-like.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.A;Guilds were an hindrance to prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.T;The Status Quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.D;The prince has refused to end the Guilds, claiming they were an important part of Novgorodian society that could not be liquidated. Intellectuals resent Novgorod's unwillingness to abandon what they consider its feudal roots and eastern trade remains the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.A;Well, nothing changed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.T;The end of the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.D;The Fur Traders Guild was dissolved by the Prince following the Semyonov testimony, but it soon resurfaced under a new guise. Trans-Uralic trade ended up still heavily regulated and Novgorod-based merchants were able to keep the largest slice of the cake, leaving the Yugrian and Pomors in relative poverty. The liquidation was thus a radical move (and expensive) but it neither changed the situation for Northerners nor shook up the traditional status quo of Novgorod's trade regulations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.A;Well, this backfired...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.T;The Prince refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.D;The Prince has refused the proposal to end the Fur Trade Guild, preserving the status quo in spite of the recent revelations. Following this action, it appeared to most people in the north and east that Novgorod had once again taken a step backward, preserving ancient institutions to keep its aristocrats happy instead of choosing the interest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.A;Is it that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.T;A new proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.D;The Prince has refused the liquidation of the Guild and chose to enforce a competition regime, starting by granting a chapter to the Laptevs to create a new Fur Trade Company with a timed monopoly on Siberian and Arctic Trade. With their practises exposed in Novgorod the Guild is forced to reform and change its stances towards the Yugrians, and even start working with the Laptves. The economy of Novgorod is booming, and eventually the fur trade system becomes the basis for new enterprises in the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.A;A happy ending!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.D;Novgorod maintained control of the lower Ob river valley (also known as Kantekia) with the support of various Khanty and Mansi tribes hostile to the Sibir Khanate. While the southern tribes were under the control of the Yugrian Confederation, tasked with the protection of the Urals from Siberian raids, the northern tribes recognised the authority of a Prince, who had direct contact with a Novgorodian military governor. The Prince of Kondia (from the name of an Ob tributary) collected the yasak from the local Khanty-Mansi tribes, including some from the Siberian wilderness. By taking advantage of a period of political distress, the Prince of Kondia has become even more politically relevant. Some tribes in the south and the east have also gathered under his protection, defying their old Tatar or Cossack masters. The Princedom of Kondia is now, de facto, a vassal state of the Novgorodian Confederation and not a mere tribal institution to collect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.A;A worrying development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.D;We are forced to give lands to the Prince of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.T;The Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.D;For a long time, the inhabitants of the Russian Far North have met and mixed with Uralic people, Southerners fleeing war and serfdom, Cossacks and Tatars searching for new homelands, sects and monks looking for isolation and many adventurers willing to risk their lives in the Arctic Sea. Thanks to this varied influx of cultures and the proximity to the sea, the "Pomors'' have distinctive traditions and customs that make them unlike any other Russian community. Most of them are Povolniks, people who are not bound by constant obligations with any guild, princedom, monastery or boyar. The main center of Pomor culture is the port of Arkhangelsk. A group of Pomor intellectuals and merchants, including representatives from communities in Scandinavian territory have recently created the Saint Michael Brotherhood to further Pomor culture, economical and political interests. The organisation creates problems in Finnmark, as its local chapters alarm Scandinavian officials who are concerned about a growing Russian presence and influence in the area, but they also generate wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.A;Restrict the movement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.B;Accept their benefits and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.T;Developments in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.D;Recent events in Novgorod have started to strain the relationship between the Volosts in the North and the capital. Unlike Vyatka or Yugra, the popular assemblies of these territories are supervised by a governor sent from the capital. The locals have created a ‘Seven Volost Assembly’ gathered in Veliky Ustyug, under the auspices of salt and iron magnate Maksim Rogovich-Strogonov. They have formed a new entity under the name ‘Permyak Federation’, taking inspiration from ancient Great Perm and acknowledging Komi-Russian intermingling. Rogovich-Strogonov's immense influence in Novgorodian politics forced the recognition of his autonomous fief, of which he was chosen as the first Posadnik. Meanwhile in the farthest north, the Volost of Pustozersk refused integration into the Permyak Federation. This region is dotted with isolated orthodox monasteries, acting as intermediaries between the Pomor merchants and the Nenets tribes. From the chapter of Pustozersk, Archimandrite Tikhon gained the prerogatives of the former governor in Zapolyarnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS49.T;The Pomor Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.D;The Pomors have reached a point of no return regarding their relationship with Veliky Novgorod. After centuries of obedience and service, the people of the Russian Far North have decided to organise into an autonomous political entity within the Novgorodian confederation. No longer shall governors and city boyars hinder the decisions of the free Pomor people. This has been a painful decision, but following the birth of numerous Pomor cultural associations and their meddling with the politics of Arkhangelsk it had become clear that Pomor separatism was gaining the upper hand in the region. Secession talks are still frowned upon, but this separation will leave an ugly scar regardless. The prince of Novgorod can decide to nominate a prince when he promulgates the Founding Charter of the new state or let the Pomors govern themselves with fully democratic institutions like Vyatka and Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.A;Nominate a prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.B;Let them rule themselves;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.T;Scandinavian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.D;Our annexation of Pskov and our refusal to part with Ingria has attracted the ire of the Scandinavians. Copenhagen sees us as a possible threat to their Baltic hegemony and has declared war on us with the intent to humiliate us and retake the coastline. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.A;We learnt from Nevsky !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.T;Utter defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.D;Not a single shot was fired in the end. Scandinavian troops walked in Karelian villages with the approval of the locals as the instability of the Republic has grown too strong. Our leaders were weak and divided and we pay the price for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.A;How could that happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.T;Victory in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.D;To the surprise of many, Novgorodians managed to fight back the Scandinavians, surprising their regiments in the cold forests of the North. The Republic was divided, but now it appears stronger than before, with the leaders of the Republic joining together for the cause. The victory of Novgorod has been deemed the new David and Goliath fight in Russia, and many patriots rejoice throughout the land for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.A;A glorious event !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.T;Defeat in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.D;Karelia was soon taken by the Scandinavians as our Republic could not manage to muster its forces efficiently against this stronger enemy. The divisions between our leaders have hampered our war effort and many people have grown disillusioned at the state of the Republic, especially the Pomors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.A;It’s just snow and trees though;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.T;The War for what ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.D;Karelia didn’t just matter to much people in Novgorod. After the various crises of the previous years, the question of holding on or not onto Karelia didn’t matter for many. Ultimately the Kremlin did not really care much than the rest of the population about deserted Pomor territory and was not willing to make it a national affair after the rough experiences of the previous years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.A;Why die for Karelia indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.T;The Glorious victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.D;Karelia may be empty land without a lot of interest but the war was seen as many as the last piece towards the rebirth of the united Republic. Soldiers fought for the unity of the nation and leaders temporalily set aside their grudges for the good of Novgorod. This ensured a victory against the master of the Baltic sea and one of the great colonial empires of Europe. Now is the time for celebration and the continued reconstruction of our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.A;Long live our Lord Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.T;Revanchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.D;The war for Karelia had mobilized every soul and body in the nation but it was not enough in the end. But as Karelia was lost, our national consciousness still endures stronger than ever. People are already enlisting and preparing for the revenge and reconquest of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.A;We’ll get them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.T;The massacre of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.D;Scandinavian victory was the natural result in their war against Novgorod. The armies of the Republic could not stand and defend the lands they had stolen from Scandinavia. Eventually Scandinavians breached the city walls and secured the Kremlin. As they intended to place another puppet Prince a bomb exploded and killed several men of a Norwegian regiment. In retaliation, the troops set the city ablaze, looting and killing on sight. Novgorod ended on this day, as the various states east declared independence and refused to let Scandinavians into their country. Copenhagen settled on influencing the rump states of Novgorod and the Pomors, securing their hold in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.A;What an horrible fate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.T;The miracle on the Neva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.D;Many thought that Novgorod would be forced to submit to Scandinavia after having annexed the Republic of Pskov. But the forces of the fledging Republic managed to fight back the foreign troops and securing their hold on the Baltic. Now is a time of celebrations in the Republic, as Scandinavia has also been forced to pay heavy reparations and admit the independence of Lord Novgorod the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.A;The world turned upside down !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.T;The defeat of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.D;The attempt by Novgorodians to challenge the status quo and take back the Republic of Pskov ended in defeat as Scandinavians managed to get back their territories and occupied large swaths of land in Novgorod proper. The Novgorodian prince was forced to go to Copenhagen to sign an humiliating treaty. Pskov was to be taken back by Scandinavia and the Republic would pay an enormous war reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.A;A shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.T;Scandinavian defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.D;The Second Neva War has ended in victory for Novgorod which managed to take back its Baltic Coast and force Scandinavia to recognize its independence. In addition, heavy war reparations were paid in exchange for the numerous Scandinavian prisoners trapped during the winter campaign and the end of occupation of the Baltic and Finnish lands of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.A;A glorious future for Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.T;Victory for Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.D;Scandinavia fought an hard war in Novgorod as militias from the whole Confederation flocked to the Baltic coast to defend their land. Even after countless victories on the battlefields, the spirit of Novgorod was never broken. When they entered the city Kremlin, the officials had fled to the countryside and led a guerrilla war. Eventually peace was signed with heavy reparations, but Novgorod endures as a strong country in Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.A;Peace without victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.T;Victory of Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.D;The Second Neva War had triggered a national awakening in the Republic as the people came together to fight the oppressors. Militias from the whole Confederation held on the Baltic fortresses and forced the Scandinavian armies to flee from their country. Huge crowds have gathered in the capital to celebrate the victory and public enemies like the Posadnik Levashov and the Prince of Galich Matveyev were seen together with the Prince to announce a reorganization of the Republic with a new Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.A;Long live Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.T;The Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.D;The Millennial Charter has been signed by representatives from the whole Republic, giving Novgorod a new written constitution following the national cohesion created by the war. The confederate nature of the republic is formally preserved, but the reorganisation de facto creates a federal system with a strong central authority under the helm of the Veche. Powers of the Prince and Lords have been reduced, while serfdom is gradually abolished throughout the land, although compensation for former owners are very expensive. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.A;A new millennium for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.T;Treaty of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.D;Our aim was to take back the whole Republic of Pskov, but the war took such a huge toll on our forces that many think it would be best to just limit ourselves to the Baltic coast as to not trigger another war in the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.A;We will be merciful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.B;We won didn’t we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.D;After a long and disastrous reign, Simeon Yumin, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died. Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation.\n\nThe Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached Novgorod yet. Dimitriy Matveyev, the Prince of Galich, and one of the most reactionary figures in the feudal faction, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.A;These are troublesome times;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.T;The Siege of the Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.D;After weeks of deadlock, the Prince of Galich has decided with the support of the military to take power. While the plot was largely successful as the troops took control of most of the city, the liberals and progressives barricaded themselves in the city Kremlin. Among them, Konstantin Levashov, the Posadnik and leader of the progressive faction, awaits the arrival of the Northerners and Siberians while hiding in the city Kremlin. The siege begins, with the Kremlin completely cut off by the troops of the feudal faction. Eventually, the Prince of Galich offers a final deal to the besieged: exile or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.A;Exile is best for the city...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.B;The Posadnik holds on;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.T;Death of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.D;Following the ultimatum from the Prince of Galich, the Posadnik Levashov convened with his followers gathered in the Kremlin and decided to accept exile. A white flag was hoisted from the walls, as the defenders walked out and passed before the infamous Prince of Galich who still kept true to his word and let them go without molestation. With the siege of the Kremlin ending and the exile of his opponents, the Prince is free to reorganize Novgorod as he sees fit. All pseudo-democratic institutions were reduced to mere formalities while the title of Prince was formally given to the Metropolitan. But all effective power has been transferred to a Committee of Ministers led by the Prince of Galich. Meanwhile the authority of Novgorod has crumbled in the North and East, as the Pomors and Uralics refuse to accept the new state of affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.A;Novgorod lives…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.T;The shelling of the Novgorod Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.D;The besieged liberals have refused the ultimatum of their opponents, prompting the shelling and destruction of the city Kremlin. The last pockets of resistance in the ruins were then cleared by the bayonet, with the corpse of the leader of the Veche, Konstantin Levashov found in the ruins. The oldest city of Russia is forever scarred and the whole Slavic world looks at those responsible for this tragedy with shame. The title of Prince, which prompted the whole affair, remains vacant as one by one domestic and foreign candidates refuse the blood-stained crown, leaving the feudal faction in disarray. The Novgorod confederation ends, as everyone thinks for themselves. The Princes return to their fiefs, preparing to deal with the incoming rebellion while the military command establishes a provisional administrative assembly and de facto takes control of the Novgorod region. Garrisons around the country are emptied as many defect or are called to the central territories to safeguard what remains of the city and its neighbourhoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.A;A sad end for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.T;Fate of the peripheries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.D;The throne of Novgorod is vacant, after a millenium of greatness, the city of Rurik barely controls the surrounding countryside. Novgorod has become a military dictatorship and the confederation has been dissolved. The Siberian delegates reach the city as it resembles more of a military barracks than the old capital. Their assembly no longer exists, the periphery has been abandoned. The shockwave of the collapse makes local institutions unstable, opening the path for commanders and conspirators to take the reins of the states left unguarded. The local Novgorodian garrisons can take control instead of retreating to the capital, or local boyars and noble with the support of the military can dissolve the democratic institutions, or simply informs them of the trying future that awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.A;Commanders take control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.B;A Prince is proclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.C;We will endure as a Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.D;The Prince of Novgorod has died, leaving behind a country more divided than ever. The boyars in the Council of Lords and the representatives of the Veche are unable to compromise on a candidate. In the baroque halls of the grandiose Yaroslav's Palace, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, a fight erupts among the delegates. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev of Galich accuses Posadnik Konstantiv Levashov of seeking absolute power for himself through populism and the bending of all institutional rules. The Posadnik replies by attacking the backwardness of the princes, whose hatred for progress in all fields is bringing the great republic down to the levels of its southern neighbours. In a final gesture of goodwill, all factions agree to convene for the first time in more than two centuries a Bishop's Veche, near the Holy Wisdom Cathedral at the centre of the Kremlin. The Metropolitan asks for a week of solitude and prayer before making his decision, hoping to find spiritual guidance through the Znameniye icon that saved the city multiple times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.A;Let the Holy Wisdom enlighten him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.T;Choice of the Metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.D;In the old times, the Metropolitan of Novgorod had been a leading political figure in the Republic, especially when weak princes came and went. With the decline of Unitarianism and the rationalisation of traditional political institutions, the religious head lost most of its influence, while remaining a respected national unifying figure even for Orthodox citizens. The old Metropolitan Dmitry, confirmed by Rome and Tver merely three years prior, had little experience with the city's politics, preferring the ascetic lifestyle of the city's numerous monasteries, yet he had no choice but to bear on his shoulders the confederation's future. He ponders his options: Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, a prominent and devout nobleman has the support of the aristocracy. Meanwhile, he could say he found no figure and propose a vote of the unified Veche. Or he could propose a vacancy of the office, leaving four years for the oppositions to die down. As he emerges from the Cathedral before the Veche he finally proposes.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.A;The Metropolitan proposes Chemiakin-Belsky for the Prince office;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.B;Count the votes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.C;The Metropolitan proposes to elect no Prince for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.T;The Cathedral explosion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.D;The Metropolitan announced his support for the feudal faction's candidate, Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, an affluent landowner from a minor branch of the Yaroslavl's Belsky known for his zealous patronage of church-building projects and traditional values. This decision infuriated the anti-feudal faction and made the delegates from Siberia and the North particularly uneasy given the Prince's zealotry. Right before the enthronement ceremony, boycotted by the opponents, a powerful explosion devastates the entrance of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, killing 24 participants including the Metropolitan. Vyacheslav survives, miraculously unscathed, and immediately blames his opponents. The Veche is dissolved via ukase while the ‘plotters’ are sentenced to capital punishment in absentia. In Staraya Russa, on the other side of the Ilmen Lake, the surviving members of the Veche pledge their loyalty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", a metaphorical way to refer to the City, refusing to swear fealty to a Prince. The two sides gear up for war to restore the "Republic".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.A;We follow the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.B;We follow Lord Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.T;Change of alliances;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.D;Following the coup in Novgorod, we have chosen to side with the Republican forces in Pomoria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.A;For the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.D;The division between the feudal and anti-feudal factions have grown too much to amend without bloodshed. Now is the time to reunify Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.A;For the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.D;Prince Vyacheslav Novgorodsky, as he has been renamed, has won over his opponents, unifying Novgorod under his strong hand. Novgorod has become a princedom not very much different from his southern neighbours, especially Yaroslavl, and it seems that the ambitions of the Northern State will not stop at just unifying Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.A;Long live Vyacheslav!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.T;Restoration of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.D;Prince Vyacheslav has been defeated along with his allies by the free forces of the North and the East. The old republic is restored, with a sympathetic nobleman proclaimed as the new prince by the restored Veche. The Council of Lords has been curtailed however and the old princedoms of the Confederation have been annexed directly in retaliation for their actions. Novgorod is far from being truly united as the control over the East and North is not assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.A;Long live the restored Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.T;Change of allegiance;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.D;We are now a puppet of Novgorod as before;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.A;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.T;The Peace of Cherepovets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.D;The war has ended without a true victor. Novgorod is now reduced to the original city and the old feudal princes, while its former subjects in the East and North have become independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.A;An end to the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.T;The Bakers Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.D;After the Metropolitan categorically refused to assume the title of Prince or a new ad hoc equivalent, voting resumed. But the conflict amidst factions grew so violent that the bishop's Veche had to be dissolved and the Kremlin vacated with military intervention. Street fighting ensued between the City's Guard and supporters of the opposed factions. After a week of attempted restoration of control, rumours of incoming military columns from Beloozero and the South started spreading. Supporters of the feudal faction had already escaped the city when an anti-boyar pogrom ravaged the city. Posadnik Konstantin Levashov organised a makeshift "Five Kontsy Council'' to replace the de facto defunct Council of Lords and Veche. The "Bakers’ Coup'', as it was contemptuously called in the princedoms, marked the end of the "Old Republic". The reactionary states of the Confederation joined forces with a large section of the military command to restore order in Novgorod at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.A;The Republic must put down the princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.B;The Prince of Beloozero will safeguard our traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.T;The Novgorodian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.D;After weeks of pointless negotiation and preparation on both sides, Levashov formally declared the Princedom of Beloozero and Galich enemies of the confederation and prepared to end their continued independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.A;For the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.T;Victory of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.D;Beloozero has fallen and the republic has been preserved. Levashov nonetheless refused to disband his puppet Five Kontsy Council and has proposed the creation of a "Chamber of the Pyatinas" as a parallel assembly. The Council would legislate on Novgorod's surroundings, while the Chamber would deal with matters regarding the periphery. The Posadnik would remain a leading figure in both institutions, as they are filled with his own yes-men, but the states' autonomy would be respected, at least formally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.A;Our Posadnik knows the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.T;Posadnik’s choice;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.D;We accepted Levashov’s power grab because of the threat the feudal lords have portrayed, but now that Beloozero and Galich are vanquished, it seems that he will not be content with the way the republic worked. He has sent a message to all the members of the confederation to join the ‘Chamber of Pyatinas’ and to be integrated more closely into the republic. But at the same time, the old institutions that guaranteed our rights and a form of democracy have been side-lined, so we could refuse this new arrangement and go our own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.A;We follow the Posadnik...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.B;We won’t accept tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.T;The "New Confederation Charter";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.D;With the old confederation integrated and under the power of Levashov, the Posadnik has promulgated the New Confederation Charter that acts as the new Constitution of the republic. The powers of the Posadnik are near absolute, as he rules for life and can appoint at will the members of the various assemblies. At least Novgorod knows order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.A;Long live the Posadnik-for-life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.T;Reorganization of Novogorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.D;The Five Kontsy Council that led the city since the riots that followed the Bishop’s Veche has been vanquished by the princes and members of the military. Novgorod is pacified as the would-be Dictator Levashov lies hanged like a peasant inside the Kremlin. The city suffered another scarring event with a terrible repression, but order is now reinforced. A puppet noble, Roman Medvedev, has been selected as the prince of Novgorod, and the old institutions have been reformed to concentrate all real power in the Council of Lords, the true political body of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.A;Long live the aristocrats!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.T;Annexation of Beloozero;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.D;Fulfilling its political goals, Beloozero is ready to rejoin Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.T;End of the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.D;As the war dragged on, the free states blamed Levashov for having destroyed the confederation and the loss of liberties and rights they suffered. The East and North thus left, while the southern princes were also unable to defeat the Posadnik. His powerbase in Novgorod has been consolidated and he tightened his grip on the city and its surroundings. The Novgorod Republic now only exists on paper and the new Novgorodian state forged by the "New Rurik" is a completely new entity where power rests only in the hands of the Posadnik who rules for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.A;A sad end for Novgorod...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.T;The Metropolitan prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.D;The last vacancy of the Novgorodian throne dated back to two centuries earlier and it coincided with partial Scandinavian occupation, leading some to think that the confederation had effectively entered its final days. Postponing the election of the Prince requires a supermajority in the joint assembly of the Veche and the Council of Lords. The feudal faction demands to vote for a new prince, knowing well that a vacancy would mean greatly expanding the prerogatives of Posadnik Konstantin Levashov. As the assembly nearly ends up in riot, the Metropolitan decides to take a decisive step to avoid the dissolution of the confederation. Against his wishes, he accepts the nomination as Prince. The feudal faction reluctantly accepts the compromise, hoping to be advantaged by a conservative leader. But the Metropolitan is politically incompetent and his desire to stay neutral leads to absolute prominence of the Posadnik. Only a few weeks after the election, the Council of Lords is dissolved by decree of the Veche, prompting division in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.A;An unexpected development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.D;The dissolution of the Council of Lords by the Veche has alarmed the southern princes, who fear that the new regime will restrict their privileges. The Posadnik Levashov has thus decided to declare war to restore order in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.A;Destroy the Princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.T;Victory of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.D;The Republic of Novgorod has vanquished the reactionaries of the southern princedoms, securing the role of the Veche and other democratic institutions. The first act of the reunified Republic was the long-awaited abolition of serfdom. But even victorious, the Republic has already fallen again in various political disputes, and it seems there is no grand vision of its future and its role amongst the various eastern Slavic states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.A;A victory nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.T;Feudal victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.D;As the Prince of Beloozero and Galich managed to win against the new Novgorod Republic, the confederation has reverted back to its old state: Levashov has fled abroad as armies marched to the city and the Veche has been purged, while old institutions like the Council were reinstated. The Metropolitan abdicated as the prince and the winners of the war chose Roman Medvedev, a weak nobleman as the new prince. The confederation appears frozen in its old derelict state, and it will not have the strength to rescind the rights of its constituent states, should a threat appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.A;A new situation in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.T;Failure of the republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.D;The white peace between the princes and the republic was seen as a shameful stain on the republic. Convinced that the urban bourgeoisie could not lead the republic to a strong future the various members of the confederation chose to leave and take their fate into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.A;The end of a political legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.T;Death of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.D;The death of the Prince of Novgorod closed a troubled parenthesis in the history of the Novgorodian Confederation. Veliky Novgorod, the Russian gate to the west, represented the tensions between two seemingly irreconcilable societies: a city of world-travelling merchants, sublime poets and Croesus-like lords living and voting side by side with the wretched of the Russian lands, the faceless human machines in the new factories or the wandering souls of the rural estates and arctic villages. Many Panrussian intellectuals thus look at Novgorod as the most desirable candidate for the unification of the Slavs. During the joint meeting of the Council of Lords and the Veche to nominate the new prince, many wanted to seize the opportunity to settle old feuds, notably the Posadnik Levashov. But in the end, his candidate, the weak Roman Medvedev, was soundly defeated by the Livonian noble Pyotr Gustavovich Litke, the first non-boyar elected to the office. Originally from Dorpat, he had made himself known in Novgorod for his anti-Scandinavian rhetoric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.A;Long live Pyotr Gustavovich!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.T;The nomination of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.D;The first obstacle to the rule of Prince Pyotr Litke was the cohabitation with his insubordinate Posadnik Levashov. Gathering allies in the Veche, Pyotr Litke helped the Prince of Galich and Levashov's main opponent Ivan Anisimov strike him down. Konstantin Levashov thus lost his title of Posadnik a few days after the election, but retained his seat in the Veche. The Prince now has the power to influence the selection of the next Posadnik, but he knows well that he must play divide et impera. Having been elected for his strong will and his distance from any major boyar clan, his role was to remove Levashov and restart the political rotation of the office between the factions. Litke has ambitions of his own and he knows that his supposed allies have little esteem of him, but at the same time he knows that to build his rule he needs solid foundations. The prince can either come to terms with Levashov and allow the election of Anisimov as Posadnik or let the ex-Posadnik and the Cossack smear each other freely in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.A;The Prince brokers a deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.B;The Prince stays out of it;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.T;Anisimov elected Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.D;After a series of meetings between the candidates and the Prince, the Veche elects Ivan Anisimov as the new Posadnik. The session was surprisingly calm given how Levashov's supporters had insinuated until merely days prior that Anisimov was a co-conspirator of a "reactionary coup". Many saw this event as a sign of the Prince's effective mediation skills and Levashov's acceptance of his downfall. But two weeks after the election, Levashov's political stances had completely reversed, bringing him back in the spotlight. He claimed that Anisimov’s “extremist and incapable" government was bringing the country on the brink of collapse and that only the guidance of the prince could bring Novgorod back on the right track. Even if Anisimov had only ruled for a dozen days, he had already attracted resentment from nearly all Novgorodian society for he was ambitious and idealistic, but far from capable. Once again, Pyotr Litke moved behind the scenes to broker a deal between two former archenemies: Konstantin Levashov and the prince of Galich Dimitriy Matveyev.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.A;What does the prince choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.T;The curtailing of the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.D;In a surprising turn of events, Prince Pyotr Litke openly addressed the Veche about the government of Posadnik Anisimov, deeming it "divisive" and "misguided". With the compliance of the reactionaries brought by Matveyev, Levashov's cronies and the disillusioned former supporters of Anisimov, the prince has bent centuries old rules with a simple speech. Not only had he curtailed the Posadnik as the most influential figure in the state, he had also greatly reduced the prominence of the Veche. With the Veche under control and Anisimov removed from power, the new Triumvirate of Litke, Levashov and Matveyev affirmed the control over the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.A;Long live the new Princedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.T;The Novgorodian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.D;Following his speech in the Veche, the prince gathered his allies to work on a constitution. Levashov and Matveyev old distrust and enmity was soon soothed by the diplomatic attitude of the prince. The three men agreed that Novgorod’s institutions were to be renovated. The prince would gain accrued power establishing a Western cabinet for affairs of state and becoming an hereditary office. In exchange for these concessions, the old Veche and Council of Lords would still exert power. Levashov obtained the minister of finances while Matveyev was chosen as prime minister with the support of both chambers, unifying the confederation once and for all under the rule of the prince and his two trusted advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.A;Long live the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.T;Political deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.D;Despite his actions, Litke was not able to find a common ground between Levashov and Matveyev, leading to a political deadlock. But the prince knew that he hadn't yet moved all his pieces. With the paralysis of government activities due to the political crisis many were starting to fear an action of force to restore order. The Novgorod garrison stands on alert, the prince of Galich has retreated to his estate while Levashov preaches to the mutinous capital about the sacredness of the ancient laws of Novgorod. The choice of the prince is now pivotal: will he ask the garrison to enforce order in the capital or leave the Kremlin and address the people to reassure them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.A;Gun the rioters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.B;There is no problem here;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.T;The military steps in;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.D;The outrageous order of the prince shocked the garrison, which was preparing for attacks from outside the city, leading to a general mutiny. Levashov made a last attempt to save his face and distance himself from the prince, but his position was too compromised. Both the prince and the former Posadnik were brought under arrest by none other than Ivan Anisimov and his Cossack guards. The war hero and popular leader Anisimov, rivalled only by his defeated nemesis Levashov, had discarded the mask of democratic kindness, choosing his favourite recipe to restore order and peace: with military discipline and ruthless action. While the two "conspirators" were allowed to rot into the prisons of the Kremlin, Prince Matveyev was not so lucky as even before he could reach his estate and prepare to march on Novgorod, he was gunned down by one of Anisimov's best men. The whole Novgorodian Republic was now ruled the same way it controlled the northern wastes: living in fear in the shadow of the barracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.A;Novgorod will know order;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.T;The Novgorodian autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.D;The prince found the crowd already energised by Konstantin Levashov. After reassuring them that there was no incoming army, Prince Pyotr Litke started attacking the Posadnik and his government for letting the situation slip out of their hands. Seizing the moment, he announced the dissolution of the government by decree and the creation of a princely council to restore peace and the "normal functions of the Council of Lords and the Veche", which were meant to convene right after the speech. By having the consensus of the masses and the army, the Prince muted all opposition and had opponents quietly sent in prison or to the firing squad. The survivors, including Matveyev and Anisimov, bowed to the Prince a few days later in the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, where he proclaimed a new "Act for Perpetual Peace" which de facto gave him total control over all aspects of government. The Republic died, as Litke assumed autocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.A;The end of our traditions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.T;Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.D;After days of inconclusive debate, the Veche is unable to elect a new Posadnik, as no compromise can be found between the conservatives, Levashov's faction and Anisimov's supporters. Government activity is paralysed and fights erupt in the streets between the various factions. With a dike left unwatched because of the unrest, a major flood devastates the eastern part of the capital, including Yaroslavl's Palace and the offices of the Posadnik. The lower class neighbourhoods take this as a sign and rise in open rebellion. The allegiance of the military is not clear and there are rumours of a general mutiny or a coup. The Prince is forced to lock down in the Kremlin, cut off from the outside world due to the incessant guerilla warfare around the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.A;This is madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.T;Unrest continues;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.D;The Prince still hides in the Kremlin, as the riot continues to engulf the city. The Citizen Guard formed by Levashov and the Cossacks of Anisimov rallied all men of good conditions, and restored order to the city. Now the prince must either turn towards Levashov, or heed the advice of Matyevev who has sent him a letter about restoring ‘order at all costs’.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.A;Accept Levashov’s call;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.B;Order at all costs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.T;Rule of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.D;Thanks to the last minute collaboration between Levashov and Anisimov, the rebels were pushed towards the devastated riverside where they had no choice but to surrender or fight to the death among the rubble. Sadly Anisimov was shot during the street fighting, leaving only the former Posadnik at the top to once again prove to be a godsend for his people. For a few months, Levashov continued to govern with emergency decrees while the two chambers remained inactive and the Prince and the Metropolitan were safely secluded to avoid undue interference with the business of government. When the situation came back to normal, nothing had formally changed in the structure of government, but it had become obvious that the confederation was now ruled by one man only with his clique of cronies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.A;Levashov played everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.T;Matveyev’s intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.D;The general uprising comes to a sudden end as news of an incoming military column starts to spread. The provisional Council of the Five Kontsy, assembled by Posadnik Anisimov with the last minute support of Levashov (tragically deceased after an ambush), had almost completed the pacification of the city with the help of the garrison's loyalist faction, when from Ilmen Lake came the troops of the prince of Galich. From the ruins of Yaroslavl's Court, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, he ordered Anisimov to surrender the city claiming to have been summoned by the prince to restore order. The exhausted citizen's guard had retreated north, preparing for urban warfare, with no intention to surrender. The garrison remains neutral, awaiting orders from the prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.A;Litke supports Matveyev;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.B;Litke contacts Anisimov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.T;The tale of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.D;The prince of Novgorod emerged from the Kremlin, confirming his support for Matveyev's actions and ordered the immediate disarmament of the "rebel militias". Meeting on the New Bridge, which had miraculously withstood the flood, the two princes organised the next political and military moves to ensure the pacification of the city and the restoration of order throughout the confederation. Their demise, however, unfolded before their eyes as Matveyev's regiment fell into Anisimov's trap. The two princes then tried to retreat to the Kremlin, only to find that the garrison had defected to the Posadnik, after Matveyev army’s terror tactics. The Battle on the New Bridge between Anisimov's Cossacks, the citizen's guard, and the garrison and the remnants of Matveyev's expedition force ended with a bloodbath and the summary execution of the two Princes. Hailed as a hero and the savior of the Republic, Anisimov declared the princedoms dissolved and in the following months proceeded to call the elections for a new Constituent Assembly to write a constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.A;Long live the hero of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.T;One Prince leaves, the other hides;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.D;After coordinating in secret with Posadnik Anisimov, the prince emerged once again to address the city, asking for relentless resistance against the coup of the Prince of Galich. Matveyev, caught by surprise, attempted to retreat away from the city, going as far as abandoning his troops to escape dressed as a monk, but the horrible conditions of the terrain and the swift action of the garrison stopped them on their tracks. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev was brought back to Veliky Novgorod, where he was publicly executed on the grounds of the Kremlin. Prince Pyotr Litke declared the dissolution of the princedoms and proclaimed the forging of a "New Union" on the ashes of the old one. With Anisimov's trusted men enforcing the Prince's will across the confederation, the city starts recovering from the recent devastation while a new Yaroslavl Court is being built to host the reformed Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.A;Long live Litke and Anisimov!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.T;The death of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.D;The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod, a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod.It has become clear to all, from the richest boyar to the most austere pomor, that the difficult and often tragic events of the last few decades have radically changed the structure of Novgorodian society who needs a new strong constitution. During the first phases of the election process for the new prince, the Russo-Livonian magnate Peter Casimir von Lütke was shot dead after accepting the candidature proposed by the conservative caucus of the two chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.A;Can Novgorod catch a break?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.T;The fall of Levashov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.D;The assassin of the soon-to-be-prince had disappeared in the shroud of the night, but he was suspected to be a petty criminal hired from the slums. The crisis paralysed the works of the assembly, as the moderates accused Posadnik Levashov of having stirred unrest in lower class neighbourhoods to start a revolt and seize power. Despite his vehement counter-accusation, this was the final nail in the coffin of Levashov's declining political career, leading to his hasty discharge. His emergency replacement was Prince Dimitriy Matveyev, assuming executive power not as Posadnik but as leader of the Council of Lords. Under common accord with the vast majority of the Veche and the Council of Lords, with the exception of few reactionary elements and die-hard supporters of Levashov, it was decided to reconvene the joint assembly in two months to write a new constitution, while a Transitional Council assumed temporary control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.A;Unusual but necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.T;The National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.D;After weeks of political deliberation throughout the city, the new Constituent Assembly presided by the prince of Galich was convened with members from the Veche and the Council of Lords. Within a few weeks of complicated negotiations, reformulation of ancient practices and innovative codification, the new constitution was ready and can only be described as...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.A;Populist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.B;Monarchic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.T;The new Popular Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.D;Despite the strong opposition of the most conservatives, it had become clear that the traditional prerogatives of the prince were an undue interference in the management of the affairs of the representatives of the Novgorodian people (with different ways based on class and census, of course). The head of state would become a symbol of national unity, as well as a moral and spiritual guide, overseeing the respect of the constitution from above the political games. Following the categorical refusal of Matveyev, it was decided as a compromise that the Metropolitan of Novgorod would always have this role, despite the timid opposition of the current office holder who was nearly forced to accept his new role. Despite this peculiar position, Novgorod grows closer to become a democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.T;The new Kingdom of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.D;The centuries old traditions have been preserved by the Assembly without sacrificing the progress made in the last decades. The new constitution has however disgruntled many progressives, who see the compromise as a grungy attempt to preserve the old power relations without bringing any real improvement to Novgorod's politics, and leaving the people without a real voice. The election of the prince has been preserved, but the powers of the office have been greatly diminished, having become redundant after the rationalisation of the relationship between the two chambers by the Constitution. Roman Medvedev has been chosen as Prince thanks to his bipartisan popularity and as a sign of compromise with the former supporters of Levashov, which had been his main political sponsor. He then unveiled the new Constitution of the Kingdom of Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.A;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.T;Preparing the Millenium of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.D;As our state prepares to celebrate the Millenium of Novgorod the Great, many projects have been gathered by city officials. The less ambitious is the construction of new boulevards in the Eastern parts of the city which would intersect in front of a Bronze statue of Riourik. A renowned Anglois architect, Philippe Billaud has also proposed to destroy the old fortifications and build a new modern and planned European city. But the most ambitious and also costly project is the work of the so called 'Novgorodian school' of architecture that wants to reinvent the whole city. The Council of State must now decide between these three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.A;The Statue is fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.B;Hire Billaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.C;Let the young Novgorodians have free rein!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

decree_to_abolish_samurai_title;Decree to Abolish the Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
decree_to_abolish_samurai_desc;As Japan enters the modern age, the samurai stand out as anachronistic. A feudal warrior class is not what the Japan of the future needs, and the time has come to eliminate them. This will be done peacefully through levying taxes onto their government stipends and converting said stipends into government bonds, along with replacing samurai as battlefield commanders with a professional and fully meritocratic officer corps. Though former samurai families may adopt the title of shizoku, or "warrior family," to preserve some of their honor and prestige, the samurai as a martial class will soon be but a memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
destroy_the_samurai_title;Destroy the Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
destroy_the_samurai_desc;The samurai have become a clear and present danger to national security. Not only are they a backwards remnant of the old Japan, but their status as hereditary warriors loyal not directly to the state but to the daimyo, or even, in the case of ronin, to nobody, places the government and its citizens under constant threat of intimidation or revolt. They have even displayed a disturbing tendency to support political ideologies, particularly reactionary and traditionalist schools of thought which are anathema to our own ideas. They must be eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Our government is rapidly reaching the conclusion that we must expand our accessto the world, but a question lies before us about how far to go. Should we preserve at least some restrictions in the name of economic and cultural protection, or are all forms of isolation to be discarded?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
weaken_guild_privileges_title;Weaken Guild Privileges;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
weaken_guild_privileges_desc;The guilds' monopoly on nearly all aspects of trade and production are enfeebling our economy and chaining us down with obsolete methods and ideas. While we are not yet in a position to abolish them entirely, we can establish a set of restrictions on their operations, while also expanding the rights of merchants and generally promoting free trade as an economic practice. Taken together, these measures will undermine the guilds' dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_imperial_guilds_title;Abolish the Kabunakama;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_imperial_guilds_desc;The kabunakama, or imperial guilds, are a parasite upon the Japanese economy, shackling us to medieval conceptions of production and distribution. A modern Japan cannot have such a backwards financial system. We will issue an order immediately dissolving all guilds and seizing their assets, before splitting these assets up and selling them off to independent merchants piece by piece to prevent any one merchant from gaining too much. This will breathe new life into our economy and end guild monopolies at a stroke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_kill_the_cult_title;Eliminate the Imperial Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_kill_the_cult_desc;The establishment of an extreme Shintoist movement emphasising absolute religious purity, fanatical hostility to all other faiths, and most of all the Emperor being a living kami and ruling through absolute and divine right, has been a disaster for Japan. This cult, spread by the infernal Ministry of Divinity, has perverted our ancient traditions and caused no end of suffering, not to mention emboldening cultists to fight on even after their "divine" sovereign was deposed. We must undertake a dedicated police and propaganda effort to both wipe out the cult's remaining practitioners and de-legitimize the cult's ideology and theology among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_title;Embrace Full Secularization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_desc;The pursuit of egalitarianism and the emancipation from outdated ideas has spread the notion of freedom of religion throughout our nation. While unthinkable mere decades ago, today Japan is accepting its status as a land of multiple faiths. Shintoism, Buddhism, Catholic and Protestant Christianity, even the shamanism of peoples like the Ainu, and many subdivisions within these religions, all exist within our nation. In light of this, it is absurd for our government to lift any one faith above the others as a matter of policy. Formal state support for any religious faith, institution, or organization shall be terminated and henceforth banned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Sunrise Period. Although it was not the only such "mission", being heavily inspired by the earlier Fukuzawa Mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of strained relations with the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch-Burgundian missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck years after the conclusion of the Fukuzawa Mission ordered by Prince Regent Mitsuhito. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To cultivate Japanese diplomatic ties with the Great Powers and the West in general, and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imperial_rescript_desc;During the Sunrise Period, the leadership of the Japanese government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centred on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality. However, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for a "state-centred" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Japan's head of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

imperial_japanese_navy_title;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled "Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion” asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan's primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy. After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

adopt_western_calendar_desc;While we are loath to admit it, the western calendar is superior to our own. The western calendar is better at tracking the seasons while our need to add in leap months to our own just to stay in sync is absurd. In order to better appease the traditionalists we will of course rename all days and months to be of Japanese origin as well as using a new Japanese style Era system along with the Western Common Era year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.T;A New Shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.D;Last year, Tenno (Emperor) Komei was crippled in a failed assassination attempt, and is now confined to his bed and rarely conscious. Unfortunately, the Tenno is only in his fifties and he is likely to live for decades more. Abdication has almost never occured in Japan, and even if that was an option, his heir is a one-year-old baby. Thus Prince Mitsuhito, Komei’s brother, has assumed the position of Sessho-no-miya, or Prince Regent. Mitsuhito was already the Daiko-Daijin, or Great Chancellor, of the Daijo-Kan, or Great Council, of the Imperial Court. The Great Council was reformed following the Imperial merger with the bakufu, but Mitsuhito seems intent on using it to claim even more power. Mitsuhito has gained rapid support among Japanese traditionalists-who seek to defend the “kokutai,” a complex phrase describing Japan’s national and cultural sovereignty-and has even begun to be referred to by his reformist and moderate opponents as a Neo-Shogun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.A;We shall keep a close eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.T;Return of Admiral Yusumoto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.D;A retainer of the Date clan, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki is deeply connected to Japan’s colonial endeavors in northwestern Arcadia. A strong proponent of the Hokkaiganese fur trade and a specialist in amphibious warfare, Yusumoto was the only surviving admiral of the Xiazhou Expedition, the ill-fated attempt to conquer Qingqiu. Owing to his familiarity with the region, Yusumoto volunteered to lead a team of Japanese marines to disable Qingqiuan naval defenses, but despite his heroic efforts, the marines under his command were encircled and destroyed. For this he faced exile and began travelling throughout the New World and Europe. He has written much during these travels, and these writings have finally been published after his return to Japan as the Travel Commentaries of Yusumoto Hideki. While a fascinating picture of the ways of other nations, the book also contains Yusumoto’s ruminations on the failure of Xiazhou, his arguments and suggestions for reforming the military, and some rather liberal statements on egalitarianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.A;"The national military must never be hostile to reason.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.T;The Military Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.D;Yusumoto's return to Japan and the publication of his Travel Commentaries has ignited a firestorm of controversy, all centered around the military. The reformists argue that it was Western aid which tipped the scales in Qingqiu’s favor, and thus Japan should adopt Western tactics and weapons. Most daimyos sympathize with Yusumoto and support some military reforms to avoid another Xiazhou catastrophe. Traditionalists support the proposal of the tozama or “outside” daimyo, a group of nobles who were the last to submit to Nobunaga, who have proposed to allow samurai status to be earned through victory on the battlefield, while stripping mediocre samurai of their statuses, effectively making the samurai a meritocracy. Prince Regent Mitsuhito has blamed Xiazhou’s failure on a lack of morale and purpose for the bushi (synonym of samurai) and agrees that meritocracy could revitalize them. Debate about the Military Question has begun to rage across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.A;All this because of an admiral and his book?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.T;Imperial Declaration on Military Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.D;The Military Question has become impossible for the Daijo-Kan to ignore, and the time has come to decide the future of the Japanese armed forces. There are three general options. First, the Daijo-Kan could support the tozama daimyo’s proposal to impose meritocracy upon the samurai, an idea which the Sessho-no-miya prefers since it would ensure the preservation of the samurai in some form. Second, they could draft a reform to slowly eliminate the samurai class, replacing them with a professional officer corps, but without any sudden shocks to Japanese military organization. Finally, they could embrace the radicals’ proposal to hire advisors from Europe to teach the military the lessons learned from the Great German Wars, as well as familiarize them with modern European weapons. What shall become of the Japanese military?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.A;The best commanders of Europe shall teach us their ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.B;Professional officers shall slowly replace the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.C;The samurai shall become meritocratic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.T;The Osaka Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.D;Japan’s malaise has led to increasing violence by reformists. In reaction, a traditionalist group whose name and motto is Sonno Joi, or, “Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians,” has formed, supporting Neo-Confucianism and a Sakoku or “closed country” policy. Even some traditionalists view them as a nuisance since Western trade and technology are critical for us, but some of the bushi admire Sonno Joi. These samurai have now caused trouble in Osaka, the most important city of Japan--its primary trade port, one of only three free trade ports along with Yokohama and Nagasaki, and with less powers for the Gaikoku Bugyo, foreign policy magistrates. This all has led to it possessing a large foreigner community. Yesterday, a small number of Sonno Joi samurai attacked the Anglois Merchants’ Association, killing a trader named Samuel Gallois. A crackdown was immediately launched against the Sonno Joi on the order of Mitsuhito to forestall Western retaliation, but the trade question has seized the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.A;A poor way to revere the emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.T;Trial of the Osaka Four;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.D;While the Sonno Joi movement has been curtailed across the nation, there is still the matter of Gallois’ murderers. Four samurai known to either belong to the Sonno Joi movement or support it--Sakuma Taketo, Fukuhara Hashimoto, Sanai Echigo, and Akane Shozan --appear to have been the orchestrators of the Osaka Incident. The Imperial judges in Osaka have found all four guilty of murder, and the Dual Monarchy was content with the verdict and reparations offered by the Imperial Court. The main question is whether the samurai will be allowed to commit seppuku to keep their honor, or whether we wish to have them executed as commoners to show the severity of the judgement and perhaps send a message about the future of the samurai class if such events occur again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.A;Allow them an honorable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.B;They are rebels and traitors, to the gallows with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.T;Imperial Declaration on Kaikoku Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.D;The Osaka Incident has inspired the various proponents of Kaikoku or “open country” policy to come together to try to change the official policy concerning the opening of the country to foreign trade, putting pressure on the Daijo-Kan to act. Currently, only Osaka is freely open to foreign trade, while controlled by Imperial functionaries. This excludes the leased ports of Yokohama and Nagasaki, which have become foreign enclaves. For many daimyo, further opening to trade would allow them to modernize their domains, and thus there is a strong movement to open the country even more. Moderates advise a middle ground, gradually expanding foreign access to Japan and loosening trade restrictions but preserving aspects of state control and supervision. However, the growth of the Sonno Joi movement has left a mark on our nation, and even after its curtailment there are those who believe its adherents had good ideas about preserving national integrity. What shall become of Japanese trade laws?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.A;Kaikoku must be expanded to bring prosperity to our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.B;The current system must cautiously evolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.C;Sonno Joi had a point, Kaikoku must have limits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.T;Christianity in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.D; Kirishitan are still present in Japan, but they are not what they used to be. Most Catholics are located in the Arima domain in northern Kyushu where they form an important minority along with the daimyo, thanks notably to the Jesuits of Spanish-leased Nagasaki. Meanwhile some Protestant missionaries have entered Japan through Burgundian-leased Yokohama and have converted many intellectuals over the years and have even begun to sway members of the Musashi clan itself. The status of the Christian faith, in any iteration, is ambiguous at best in Japan. Formally, it is not allowed outside of foreign legations in Osaka, and banned throughout the Imperial demesne, for example. Yet the longevity of the Christian presence and the consequences of Kaikoku mean that it has still made inroads across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.A;Hello, my name is Father Chiarra, and I am here to tell you about a most amazing book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.T;The Sadao Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.D;Shinto is an ancient Japanese polytheistic faith revolving around the kami, divine spirits which inhabit all things, and kannagara, the “way of the kami,” upholding the nature order. The growth of Japanese religious nationalism has given rise to “State Shinto,” an informal system of government-supported Shintoism. This favoritism has caused an issue in Hiroshima, due to a printer named Sadao Aoko. Owning one of the city’s largest presses, he made a fortune printing Western books at cheap prices. Towards the end of his life, he sought spiritual advice from Buddhists, Catholics, and Shintoists. Sadao recently died, and he willed his shop to three different temples-Buddhist, Catholic, and Shinto! Samurai belonging to each religion entered the city to defend their faith’s claim to the shop. After a riot in front of the shop, all bushi involved were arrested. Imperial judges awarded the shop to the Shintoists, but religious tensions are inflamed, while the Spanish government lodged a complaint since one bushi was apparently a Jesuit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.A;Our religious situation is growing perilous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.T;Imperial Declaration on Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.D;The Sadao Affair represents a dangerous recurrence not seen in many years, a clash of samurai not over Japan’s government but over matters of faith, and one which has begun to open up old wounds across the country. If we want to avoid being ripped apart by religious turmoil like so many Western nations, then we must determine a national religious policy. Three options are before the Daijo-Kan. Reformists seek to establish true freedom of religion throughout Japan, creating protections against religious discrimination to prevent sectarianism. Moderates want to formally establish support for State Shinto but also want to establish limited religious pluralism to avoid unnecessary conflict. Finally, the traditionalists, in their quest to uphold the kokutai, demand extensive support for State Shinto and the explicit confirmation, by law, of the emperor’s status as a living kami, deifying him. What shall become of Japanese religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.A;The only path to religious peace is religious freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
NJAP10.B;We shall support State Shinto but other faiths will be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.C;Shinto is supreme and the emperor's divinity is undeniable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.T;Education in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.D;For centuries, Japan has been a center of learning and education. Confucianism, introduced ages ago, stresses the importance of an educated elite, while samurai have grown to be expected to be as skilled in literature and poetry as they are on the battlefield. Over time, however, it has become obvious that Japanese educational systems, though sufficient for literacy and everyday skills, have not advanced much in contrast to the leaps and bounds of Western methods. Though reformers frequently point to the school systems of Europe and Arcadia as models for Japan, traditionalists maintain that it is merely the techniques and resources which are lacking. This issue has begun to weigh upon the Sessho-no-miya and the Daijo-Kan as the Imperial Prince, heir to the Emperor, approaches the age where he must begin his education. A decision will need to be made, not just for the sake of the throne, but for Japan’s intellectual future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.A;Time to go back to school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.T;The Fukuzawa Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.D;At the request of the Prince Regent, a group of scholars led by famed author and orator Baigan Fukuzawa have toured Europe and Arcadia, their primary goal being to investigate different Western methods of education in order to determine which elements Japan might adopt. The schools and universities of Anvers, Nouvelle Bruges, Paris, Prague, Stockholm, and Bologna were all visited and inspected by the Fukuzawa Mission. They have finally returned and presented their findings to the regent. Fukuzawa has endorsed the adoption of Western teaching methods, the pursuit of national literacy, and the support of universities. While this mission was limited in scope and we might benefit from a more substantial and broadened endeavor in the future, this information has fueled arguments regarding the merits of Western education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.A;Mitsuhito seemed unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.T;Education of the Imperial Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.D;The question of a national education policy and the question of the heir's education have become linked. Whichever method we choose to use for him shall shape him as a ruler and signal to the people our preferred course for Japanese education. Within the Daijo-Kan, reformists have proposed to scour Europe for the finest scholars and invite them to Kyoto to ensure that the Prince receives the most modern education possible. Moderates have suggested that scholars from the Yosho Shirabesho, a new school and research center in Edo founded by a group of famous academics to use Western literature and methods in a Japanese context, should be brought to educate the heir. Finally, Prince Regent Mitsuhito has declared that, as he is kin of the emperor and thus “blessed by the kami,” he should educate the heir, and it is likely that he would rely heavily on the traditionalists to aid him. What shall become of Japanese education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.A;We need a new vision - bring foreign preceptors to Kyoto!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.B;The Yosho Shirabesho shall teach next Emperor in a balanced way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.C;The blessed Prince Regent Mitsuhito shall instruct the heir personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.T;The Decline of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.D;Several institutions have come to dominate the Japanese economic landscape. The most prominent are the kabunakama, government-licensed guilds given sanctioned monopolies on certain trades such as woodcutting or brewing and operated via a group of shareholders each holding non-transmissible shares. Other groups include toimaru, wholesale merchants focused on storage and shipping, and even the venerable za, the pre-Sengoku guilds. In the aftermath of the Sengoku, Nobunaga tried to reign in the guilds by creating ‘free’ guilds known as rakuza, but many of these were eventually assimilated by the older guilds into a new type of guild, the nakama. The government then attempted to start licensing these nakama, transforming them into kabunakama, but they have now become a problem. Over the last century or so, these kabunakama have come to dominate the market, and increasing industrialization and foreign competition is hurting their profits. This has now sparked a recession and even the Imperial treasury is hurting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.A;We must untangle our economy from these guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.T;'Raikichi-Raikuza';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.D;Japan is abuzz with the new treatise, ‘Raikichi-Raikuza’ or ‘Free markets and Open guilds,’ written by Mizuno Heihachiro, Osaka’s eccentric daimyo. In it, Mizuno declares that Nobunaga sought to rebalance the Japanese economy through ‘Raikichi-rakuza’, placing urban economies into the hands of local merchants rather than guilds. This originated from the daimyo Rokakku Sayadori of Omi Province in the town of Ishidera during the Sengoku. Rokakku dissolved the za of Ishidera, granting exclusive sales and non-taxation rights to local merchants and tradesmen. This transformed the town into a trade hub, and the practice spread across Japan. However, it also fed a growing black market in order to meet rising demand. The conquest of Korea distracted the Japanese government, allowing many guilds to creep back into prominence. Mizuno concludes by arguing that these daimyo were the forerunners of liberalism. The book has become popular as people seek new financial solutions during the recession, much to the guilds’ ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.A;Freedom of commerce is our heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.T;First Bank of Osaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.D;Traditionally, each daimyo has had the right to issue their own currency, known as hansatu, while merchants have issued loans and guilds have managed trade, resulting in a disjointed financial system. A group of Osaka merchants, however, aims to change this. They have founded a new institution, the First Bank of Osaka. The goal of this bank is to store clients’ money, supply loans, print money, and make investments. The bank’s new shareholders have made it a priority to lobby the government to support new financial developments, pointing to the proliferation of Western corporations throughout Japan and arguing that Japan must develop its own indigenous corporations. All this has been done with the sanction of Mizuno Heihachiro, who has shielded the Bank from guild retaliation. The Bank’s openness and reliability has brought stability to Osaka, causing Mitsuhito to tolerate this experiment, but the kabunakama are enraged. At the same time, the Bank’s success has led people to question if guilds are still relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.A;The end of the kabunakama?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.T;Imperial Declaration on Guilds and Corporations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.D;The founding of the First Bank of Osaka has angered both guilds and reactionary daimyo across Japan. They are horrified at its infringement upon their traditional rights regarding money printing and commerce, as well as the unprecedented power which these merchants are claiming for themselves, with a daimyo’s blessing no less! The issue has reached the Imperial Court, and the Great Council must decide the fate of the Japanese economy. Reformists proclaim Mizuno to be the prophet of a free-market rebirth that Japan should embrace. Moderates propose the creation of state-supported corporations to replace the guilds, but without sacrificing state influence over the economy. Finally, traditionalists argue that the guilds are a cornerstone of Japan, and that they should be helped to modernize and reform themselves to keep the economy running smoothly, not be discarded. What shall become of the Japanese economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.A;Mizuno is right, market liberalism was born in Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.B;We must find and form new corporations to challenge the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.C;The guilds must evolve, but remain relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.T;Twilight of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.D;Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito had just emerged from his morning prayer session when the emperor’s chief physician asked for a private word with him. After making their way to the Regent’s chambers, the physician brought forth shocking news : Tenno Komei is dying. While he had never recovered from his maiming in 1835, essentially becoming vegetative, it now appears that he is reaching the end of his life. His breathing is becoming increasingly strained, his pulse growing fainter with each day, and his general condition is rapidly deteriorating. Preparations must soon be made – first for the Emperor’s passing, and then, after a period of mourning, for the heir’s coronation. Above all, however, this information must be withheld from the public so as not to cause even more chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.A;No matter what, this must not leak out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.T;Jiyu Minken Undo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.D;News of Komei’s impending death has already leaked, and now a specter is haunting Japan – the specter of political parties. For the first time, a group of like-minded reformists have come together under the banner of a Western-style organization, the Jiyu Minken Undo, or Freedom and People’s Rights Movement. Led by intellectuals but seeking to organize liberal and democratic-minded people across all social classes, the Jiyuto, as it is commonly known, hopes to use the Emperor’s passing to pressure the government for massive social reforms. Their primary demands are for a formal Japanese constitution that will enshrine the rights of the people, and many Jiyuto members also wish to push for a democratic voting system, including an elected national legislature. A few especially wild-eyed fanatics support such insane ideas as greater equality for the sexes! While purging them would be the simple option, they have brought many intellectuals into their ranks, including most scholars and educators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.A;What bizarre ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.T;The Kimimasa Draft;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.D;Kimimasa Yokoi is an infamous Japanese liberal author who fled into exile after being sought by the Imperial authorities for his pro-democracy tracts. He has shown particular interest in Burgundian and New World constitutionalism. After spending time in Atlantia, the Belgian Confederacy, Burgundy, and Vinland, Kimimasa has traveled to Hong Kong where he has joined the Jiyuto and written his most ambitious project yet : a draft for a Japanese constitution. It includes common suffrage, abolition of the class system, a Western style parliament, and the sanctioning of political parties. Kimimasa has also mentioned the “frustrations” which liberals have experienced in “service to hereditary incompetents and military dictators,” an obvious slur against the Prince Regent using the common insult of Neo-Shogun. The Gaikoku Bugyo heavily censored the work, but even they could not completely prevent its circulation, and now more and more of Japan seems to be infected with liberalism. The Jiyuto hail him as their prophet…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.A;"All people must speak and be heard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.T;The Obama Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.D;Japan is no stranger to peasant insurrections, as rural communities periodically find themselves driven to violence in order to protest tyrannical officials or to resist taxation. An incident has occurred in the town of Obama, located on the northern coast and ruled by the Sakai clan, who have been eager participants in maritime trade. The Sakai have raised higher and higher taxes on the town’s fishermen in order to attract trade via low import fees. When it was announced that taxes would be increased for the third time in three weeks, the fishermen finally snapped. Wielding fishing spears and sailor’s knives, they stormed and torched the tax collector’s office before ransacking the merchant district, touching off a general riot and extensive looting before Sarai samurai finally restored order. Disturbingly, this occurred within the Imperial domain, and the bushi report that the fishermen not only shouted Jiyuto slogans, but even called for the overthrow of the monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.A;Anarchy, treason, madness - thanks, Obama...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.T;Drama in the Daijo-Kan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.D;Tensions between Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito and the rest of the Great Council have finally erupted over the question of national security. Mitsuhito is convinced that the Obama Uprising proves that a vast conspiracy exists between liberals and newly insurgent republicans to overthrow and dissolve the Empire and replace it with a Western democratic clique. He therefore demands nothing less than an immediate and nationwide purge of the Jiyuto. Although much of the council has grown to distrust the movement, and agree that the republicans must be arrested, they and many other daimyo worry that giving Mitsuhito such a sweeping mandate could be used by the Prince Regent as a pretext to claim absolute power and crush all checks to his rule. Reformists argue that the government should focus on addressing legitimate grievances rather than seeking someone to blame, while the moderates support limited arrests with public gestures to reaffirm Imperial authority. Traditionalists, however, are ready to strike and await Mitsuhito’s command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.A;The issues raised by the liberals ring true, and we must address them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.B;A few arrests of troublesome bushi will restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.C;Let the streets run red with the blood of traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.T;Cherry Blossoms in the Evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.D;Shortly after sunset yesterday night, Tenno Komei finally passed away. He had never truly recovered since 1835, but perhaps this was a blessing, as he never saw the chaos which Japan has spiralled through since then, nor did he pass with any pain. As per procedure, upon the chief royal physician pronouncing the Emperor’s death, the Imperial Prince was immediately presented with the Imperial Regalia, a replica of the legendary Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or “Grasscutter Sword” and the royal Magatama necklace, confirming his status as the next to succeed. Imperial messengers and priests were sent to the Ise Grand Shrine, said to be the home of Amaterasu, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new Tenno's accession. Soon, all of Japan shall be in mourning, but Prince Regent Mitsuhito and the rest of the Daijo-Kan must prepare for the coronation, when the royal heir shall finally assume the Chrysanthemum Throne as the next Emperor of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

It is the joy and glory of Our heart to behold the prosperity of Our country, and it is in the furtherance of the welfare of Our subjects that this prosperity shall be advanced. All classes, high and low, shall be united in the fulfillment of their promises to Our Imperial Ancestors, just as We shall fulfill Our promise to the people to bestow upon them their Natural rights. And it is through assemblies of sagacious deliberation that the rights of the people shall be expressed.” The day that liberals dreamed of and traditionalists feared has finally arrived, as the Meiji Emperor heralds the advent of Japanese democracy. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are beginning to understand their roles in a post-feudal Japan. The newly promulgated Meiji Constitution has instituted significant protections for the rights of the people, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament drawing from all classes has laid the foundations for a true democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.A;A new day dawns, in equally new colors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.T;Fleeting Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.D;Twenty minutes before the coronation, the Imperial Prince was filled with excitement and with fear, with grief and with hope. His father had passed with a breath in the night, and now here he was, on the cusp of being made sovereign of Japan. So much planning, preparation, his entire education-no, his whole life, all leading up to this moment. Yet, he still was unsure of what sort of ruler he would be. Should he set bold goals and ally with the reformists to bring real parliamentary monarchism to Japan, or strive for a compromise between the Imperial Court and the daimyo to preserve Japan’s national character as it modernizes? Was this nation ready for truly liberal democracy? As he prepared to ascend the Takamikura, he made his decision…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.A;The time has come for serious reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.B;Tranquility must be maintained even in modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.T;The Start of the Tensho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.D;”Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for bringing balance upon this land and seeking the correct form of all things. The time has come for the lands of the Empire to be reconciled with one another, and to vigorously carry out righteous and meritorious conduct. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything shall be based upon the just laws of Nature. The ensuring of tranquility will be Our foremost goal, and it shall be built upon a strong foundation of knowledge sought throughout the world.” The Tensho Emperor has inaugurated an age of constitutionalism. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have begun to trust the Imperial Court once again. The new Tensho Constitution has transformed Japanese law, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament has sown the seeds of democracy. However, the daimyo still play a powerful role in the nation, with industrial and military connections. Though reformists hope that the door to change has been opened, many wonder if the daimyo will really lose that much power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

We have come to deliver ye and this land from those who would deprive it of life and vitality. No longer shall We be bound by the constraints of the machinations of men, nor shall We let any man be humbled before the barbarian. Our Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis of unbreakable strength and everlasting fidelity, and We call upon you now to fulfill their desires and preserve their inheritance. The time has come for ye, Our subjects, to render illustrious service unto Us. We, the descendant of Ninigi, blessed ruler of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, he who descended from great Amaterasu-Omikami, are effervescent with heavenly splendor, and shall bring about a new age of glory and righteousness upon all eight corners of the world.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.A;Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.T;The Heavenly Sovereign's Great Affirmation of Divinity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.D;Immediately after his coronation, Tenno Kyowa has begun to make sweeping changes. He has taken an unprecedented interest in politics, demanding regular reports on domestic and foreign affairs, and proclaimed the end of Kaikoku, forcing foreigners into the leased ports. He has established his own political movement, the Kodoha or “Imperial Way Faction,” which he demands all his subjects must join, while banning all other political parties. Yet these pale in comparison to his most prominent policy, apotheosis. While Shintoism holds that the Tenno is descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, Tenno Kyowa has made this law. In his Great Affirmation of Divinity, he has made denial of his divine status punishable by death, dissolved the Daijo-Kan, and created the Ministry of Divinity to promulgate his status as the chief god on Earth. By nature of his divine status, he has asserted his right to singular rule. Why, he asks, would a god need the counsel of mortals? Many people, especially daimyo, are starting to chafe at all this…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.A;Not, "Emperor," barbarian. Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.T;The Hiroshima Memorial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.D;Apostasy! Tenno Kyowa’s rigorous assertion of divine absolutism has finally driven the liberals to treason. A coalition of reformists and other opponents to the Emperor have been recruiting disgruntled daimyo in western Japan for some time. Now, this nest of vipers has issued the “Hiroshima Memorial,” declaring the Tenno to be “insane” and to have “trespassed beyond the will of Heaven,” and have finished by renouncing their oaths of vassalage! Just as old Mitsuhito feared, reformist daimyo have joined with the Jiyuto, with Kyowa’s liberal cousin Prince Takamado and a recently returned-from-exile Kimimasa becoming the symbolic leaders of this “Western Alliance.” This is blasphemy, but the reformists command sizable support, not only from their own followers, but from moderates and even some conservatives whom Kyowa has alienated. While State Shinto priests throughout the land declare that defying the Tenno’s will is heresy, many seem willing to risk damnation to overthrow the Empire. The nation sits on a knife edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.A;We shall BURN these heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Kyowa seeks to claim the heavens and all beneath them, while the western daimyo have made a desperate pact with the liberals to oppose him under the banner of the Western Alliance. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. Shall we cast our lot with one of these factions, or shall we seek to weather the storm alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.A;The rebels are our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.B;We shall be an island within the typhoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.C;The Tenno is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.D;After the treasonous and blasphemous memorial of the abominable Western Alliance, Tenno Kyowa hoped to decapitate their insurrection by quickly deploying small groups of royal regiments to seize rebellious daimyo. This has backfired tremendously, as these regiments quickly came under attack from the daimyo’s retainers, who repelled them in short order. After executing the incompetent fools that allowed such a debacle to occur, the Tenno began preparing a larger force, but it seems that the element of surprise has been lost. The Alliance has raised the flag of rebellion and announced their intention to depose the Emperor, as vast swathes of Japan rise up with them. While not all daimyo have joined them, some have declared neutrality, threatening to attack anyone who enters their domains. The future of the Empire is at stake! Shall the holy Tenno Kyowa claim the heavens and all below them or is this the end of his grand design? For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.A;Tennhoku Kyowa Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.B;The Western Alliance shall end this nightmare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.T;An Age of Glory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.D;Victory! Tenno Kyowa has crushed the Western Alliance, and his divine and absolute rule has been confirmed. All possible threats to his power, be it from raving republicans, cowardly daimyo, or scurrying so-called “moderates,” have felt either the cold hard stone of the prison cell or the merciless steel of the executioner’s blade. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted their places within the Heaven-ordained Natural order, with the glorious Tenno Kyowa as Heaven’s appointed leader on Earth. The Ministry of Divinity shall work tirelessly to eradicate false faiths, liberalism shall be annihilated, and foreign thought kept under strict control and oversight. Only the best and most useful outside ideas will be assimilated into our blessed Dai Nippon Teihoku. With the nation finally consolidated under one rule-that of our sacred, unquestionable monarch and his loyal Imperial Court-we may turn our attention and our energies to the borders. Kyowa shall bring all eight corners of the world under one roof!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.A;A new day dawns, and the Rising Sun illuminates all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.T;Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyo’s own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the mad Kyowa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyo’s tanto knife wrapped in cloth. The blade placed before him, the daimyo calmly composes his last poem, remarking solemnly on the petals of the sakura tree as they fall upon the moonlit water. Then, he consumes a ceremonial cup of sake, as his attendant does likewise. Wrapping the tanto’s handle in the cloth to maintain his grip, as his attendant stands by and draws his katana, the daimyo opens his kimono, raises the tanto, and pays the price of honor with a left-to-right cut through his abdomen before his attendant delivers the second blow through his neck. Throughout the castle, his samurai follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.A;The way of the warrior is to be found in dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.T;Daybreak;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over. The clouds of the storm have passed, and Emperor Kyowa stands triumphant. Japan shall surely be reforged in his image, and while he has passed sentence upon all daimyo who rose against him, the fate of those who neither aided nor opposed him is uncertain. While his now-overwhelming strength would seem to dictate that our only option is to renew our oath of vassalage to him, a few of the younger and more hot-headed samurai have urged our daimyo to formally declare independence. They argue that it is better to face the possibility of the Emperor’s wrath with honor than to meekly submit and once again place the Imperial yoke upon our necks. However, most samurai, older men who remember stories of rebels past, would prefer that the daimyo end his renegade status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.A;Love live the Emperor...may the Heavens help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.B;It is better to die in defiance than to live in submission!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.T;An Age of Rebirth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.D;Victory! The mad emperor has been defeated and his dreams of domination thwarted. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike awake from the nightmare of Kyowa’s arrogance into the reality of a more just Japan. Already, reformists have begun crafting a new constitution based on the Burgundian model, with a balanced government and separation of powers. The only question now is what path the new Japan shall take. Liberal daimyo want to reshape the monarchy along parliamentary lines and enthrone Prince Takamado as Emperor Meiji, “enlightened government,” while Kimimasa and the Jiyuto see the monarchy as morally bankrupt and prefer a republic. While many agree that Kyowa has sullied the Chrysanthemum Throne, the idea of ending a millenia-old monarchy is daunting. The bushi seem especially wary of the wave of democracy which has been unleashed, and may cause trouble if the monarchy is dissolved. At the insistence of the moderates, a vote is held among the leaders of the Western Alliance to decide the fate of Japan…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.A;Long live Emperor Meiji, long live parliamentarianism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.B;Enough with thrones, let the republicans forge a new Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.T;Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over, and the rebels have triumphed. Though we have lent our strength to them for this victory, some wonder if their more radical elements might not be keen to reward us. Regardless, the mad Emperor Kyowa has been vanquished, and we may now return to stewarding our domain in Kyoto’s name, whoever its ruler might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.A;We have chosen well...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.T;Dusk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Kyowa. All his agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, anti-Kaikoku foreign policy magistrates, kabunakama guild members, the Ministry of Divinity, or reactionary daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served the Emperor, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again. We had best leave as soon as possible, before the rebel armies arrive to confiscate your property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.A;I hear that Tawantinsuyu is nice this time of year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.T;The Start of the Koshi Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.D;”Know ye, Our subjects, that we shall be known for broad and vast peace. We have resolved that the disorder that has filled the lands under Heaven shall not be brought forth by Our hands, nor the hands of our most loyal and benevolent subjects. We seek absolute concord, and the furtherance of the tranquility which has always been the dearest wish of Our hearts. The filial honor that binds all of Our subjects to Us, and Us to Our subjects, is an unbreakable cord, and well it be that none seek to strain or sever it. We shall not abide those who seek to plunge these magnificent and abundant lands into tumult, nor those who would pour forth the fountain of rage upon the nations. It shall be with the open hand that Our subjects must embrace and be embraced. The path of ages is beyond the ken of any man, yet its general progression leads irresistibly towards a more perfected society. It is the realization of this condition of national harmony that We ask all of Our subjects to strive towards, for Our sake and for all peoples.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.A;...Banzai?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.T;The Great Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.D;Even before his enthronement, Emperor Koshi had been working on a secretive project. His attendants have brought him books on history, government, and law, and rumors alleged that he even slipped out of the palace in disguise to meet with foreigners! Few believed this, but now, to the horror of the daimyo, Emperor Koshi has issued an unprecedented decree. Known as “The Imperial Declaration on Righteous and Reformed Government,” or simply the “Great Reform,” it is a total transformation of the Japanese political system. It contains colossal changes : circumscribing the powers of the Imperial Court, adopting the Kimimasa Draft as the official Japanese constitution, creating an independent legislature and judiciary, sanctioning political parties and public meetings, ending border controls and state censorship, releasing all jailed political activists, disavowing imperialism, banning state funding of religion…! It concludes by proclaiming that exiled liberal Kimimasa Yokoi himself is invited to return and be made Prime Minister!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.A;He did WHAT!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.T;Shogun Mitsuhito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.D;The Great Reform has thrown Japan into chaos. The daimyo are apoplectic with rage towards Koshi, despairing at what they see as national ruination. Now, one man has decided to act. While many opponents of former Prince Regent and current Great Chancellor Mitsuhito, the emperor’s uncle, had insulted him by dubbing him a “Neo-Shogun,” few imagined that he would confirm this. However, this morning the Great Chancellor gave an astonishing speech in which he denounced the Emperor as deranged! “We must shun the poisoned fruit of Europe’s blood-soaked republicanism,” he declared. Accusing reformists of conspiring with the West, he called for a strong foreign policy and the defense of the kokutai and the kannagara. He capped off this incredible address by invoking his office and his Yamato and Oda heritage to declare himself Shogun and announced his intention to depose the Emperor! With a retinue of reactionary samurai and the support of many daimyo, he has marched on Kyoto, and is approaching the Imperial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.A;Stop this madman at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.T;The Unthinkable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.D;Japanese tradition holds that the first emperor of Japan was Emperor Jimmu, whose reign began in 660 B.C. Western historians argue that the first historically verifiable emperor was Emperor Kinmei, whose reign began in 539 A.D. What is notable is that, for one to two thousand years, no emperor of Japan has ever been assassinated. Today, however, an immutable shadow has been cast over all Japanese history. While the pretender Shogun Mitsuhito’s army attacked the main royal force stationed outside the palace, he and his retainers were able to infiltrate it. Aided by sympathetic attendants and his knowledge of the palace’s shortcuts from his years living within it, he easily made his way to the throne room. Demanding Emperor Koshi’s immediate abdication, he grew angry when the Emperor politely but firmly refused. In the struggle with the royal guards which followed, the Koshi emperor attempted to escape, but his uncle showed no mercy and committed a cataclysmic transgression. Emperor Koshi has been assassinated by Mitsuhito!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.A;And a rage in Heaven shall surely follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.T;Kegare;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.D;Kegare is the Shinto conception of spiritual impurity, and Mitsuhito seems to have immersed himself in it. With Emperor Koshi newly dead, Mitsuhito has held the briefest of funerals to mark his passing, before coronating himself as Emperor, under the regnal name of Showa, “Heavenly Peace.” News of the slaying, however, has spread like wildfire, and vast swathes of Japan are beside themselves with fury. Many accuse Tenno Showa of having committed the first Japanese regicide, not just against the Emperor for whom Mitsuhito was regent but against his own nephew. Daimyo and bushi across the land decry him as a demon incarnate. Many daimyo have rallied under Prince Konoe, Showa’s cousin and a pragmatist. Konoe has denounced Showa as a megalomaniacal kinslayer and has vowed to oust him and create a sensible monarchy. Meanwhile, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki has emerged from retirement to lead an army of radicals and bushi against Showa, declaring monarchism unsalvageable and calling for a republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.A;Do these fools not understand that this was a necessary evil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Showa has shattered every law of man and kami in his quest for absolute power, while both the moderates and the radicals have chosen leaders to bear their standards against the Chrysanthemum Throne. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. We must cast our lot with one of these factions, but which one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.A;The revolution has arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.B;Prince Konoe shall save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.C;The Emperor is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.D;As soon as Tenno Showa heard that Konoe and Yusumoto had risen against him, he called upon all those still loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne to resist the rebels and serve their emperor. Though some have obeyed, many more have shunned him for committing the unforgivable sin of assassinating Emperor Koshi, his own blood relative. While the daimyo and bushi of Japan might have been outraged by Koshi’s policies, few went so far as to call for his head, and Showa’s shockingly brutal usurpation has shattered the nation. Japan is now splintered between those who serve the Emperor, right or wrong, and those who cannot abide by Showa’s actions. The moderate monarchists and the radical republicans have both declared their intention to claim all of Japan for their respective causes. As daimyo consider joining one of these factions or fortifying their domains and declaring neutrality, the nation braces for yet more blood to be shed in the name of the Rising Sun. For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.A;Tennhoku Showa Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#NJAP43.B;Prince Konoe shall save us from this madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#NJAP43.C;Long live the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP44.T;An Age of Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP44.D;Victory! Emperor-no, enough of that barbarian word! TENNO Showa, Heavenly Sovereign Showa, has crushed all opposition, and his control of the Chrysanthemum Throne is secure. Across the country, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted Showa as their sovereign, even if they do so only because of our bushi patrolling their villages. Both Konoe and Yusumoto have failed to conquer Japan, and their movements have melted before our might. As we speak, Tenno Showa’s forces are sweeping through the nation, and all traitors shall be duly punished. Our officers assure Tenno Showa that the scourge of liberal democracy has been eradicated. The time might have come for the Dai Nippon Taihoku to enter modernity, but the kokutai shall not be destroyed in the process. With the legitimacy of Tenno Showa now beyond all reasonable doubt, Japan may finally turn its attention and its energies to its borders. We shall prove ourselves worth of the glory which the Heavens have bestowed upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP44.A;A new day dawns, as the Tenno guides us forwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP45.T;Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP45.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyo’s own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the vile Showa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyo’s tanto knife wrapped in cloth.

NJAP45.A;The way of the warrior is to be found in dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP46.T;An Age of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP46.D;Victory! We have defeated the despicable kinslayer who dared to call himself “Emperor Showa,” as well as the militant republicans. Prince Konoe has been enthroned as Emperor, taking the regnal name of Heisei, or “Peace Everywhere.” This name is indeed a great longing for the Japanese people, who wish to restore harmony after decades of chaos. Considering this, Emperor Heisei has proven to be a greater ally of the reformists than many expected, promising to work with them and even proclaiming the formation of an Imperial Parliament. While Heisei has claimed to oppose radicalism, the fact that he has left much of Koshi’s Great Reform in place has shocked many conservatives, though the bushi’s defeat seems to have shattered their political power. Most of his subjects can hardly complain about having a pragmatic Emperor, considering his predecessor. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are looking towards the future with renewed hope. Perhaps the unity which has been so out of reach in years past may finally be at hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP46.A;A new day dawns, for all people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP47.T;Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP47.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over, and the rebel monarchists have triumphed.

NJAP48.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Showa or Yusumoto. All their agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, ambitious military officers, kabunakama guild members, or opportunistic daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served their enemies, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again.

NJAP48.A;I hear that Tawantinsuyu is nice this time of year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP49.T;An Age of Bravery;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP49.D;Victory! The bushi have defied the odds and created a bold new Japanese Republic. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike behold a nation in the hands of its greatest defenders. The first order of business was the public execution of the false kinslaying emperor-Showa might have thought himself blessed by Heaven, but the executioner’s blade and the crematorium thought otherwise. This has been taken badly by those already reeling from one Imperial death, creating instability. Furthermore, many reformists seem wary of a revolution imposed by the bushi. Tragically, Admiral Yusumoto perished in battle, leaving his successors to guide the nation. His lieutenant, Saigo Ryoma, has been appointed President pending new elections. Few would have imagined samurai leading the revolution, but we have realized our true role as the stewards of Japan, and we shall both advance its interests and protect its heritage. Under the firm yet benevolent hand of democracy, Japan shall reap untold riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP49.A;A new day dawns, and we shall rise to greet it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP52.T;The End of the Joseon Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP52.D;Astonishing news has reached us-Japan has plunged into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of the previous Emperor and the enthronement of his son and heir caused difficulties owing to the character and conduct of his successor. This has caused all semblance of Japanese rule in Joseon to crumble, as Japanese administrators find their communications with Kyoto severed. As Japan leaps once more into the fire, Korean sovereignty has been restored, but we should not be quick to rejoice. The northern bandit army which has the audacity to call itself Goryeo, and which also claims to be the true government of Korea, will surely strike against us now that the mailed hand of Japan’s imperial rule no longer checks them. It seems that our newfound freedom will already need to be defended. And of course, if and when Japan emerges from their conflict, our reconquest will probably be one of their first priorities…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP52.A;We must defend our home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP53.T;The Grand Invasion of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP53.D;Wonderful news has reached us-Japan has plunged back into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of yet another one of their delusional emperors and the enthronement of his wretched spawn caused difficulties owing to the heir’s presumably wicked personality. This has caused the cowardly Japanese colony to find its puppet-strings severed, as Japanese administrators find their chauvinism brought low by the righteous anger of the long-oppressed Goryeonminjok. But, enough talk, now is the time for action! The pretenders in the south have already organized a preposterous regime that is the obvious inheritor of Japan’s colonial legacy. There is no time to waste, we must march south and unite the peninsula before the Japanese beast returns. For a free and whole Goryeo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP53.A;We must liberate the South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP54.T;The End of the Han System;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP54.D;The day that many daimyo had feared has finally come : the dissolution of the han system, and the formal reorganization of Japan’s administrative divisions into prefectures overseen by governors. While we daimyo shall be compensated for our lost estates, and be entitled to the honorary status of genro, or “elder statesmen,” the curtain is now falling on an entire epoch of Japanese history. The strength of the government is irresistible, and we shall have to accept a future without daimyo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP55.T;The March of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP55.D;With Japan’s increasing stability, the government has decided that the time has come for us to relinquish our autonomy. Though the bureaucrats which arrived to take over our government offices assured us that our local traditions would be properly respected, a palpable feeling of loss has descended upon our people. A level of freedom, however limited, has been stripped away. Perhaps we shall be better off in a single, united Japan. Who can say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP56.T;The Messenger;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP56.D;He seemed unassuming, even plain. His clothes were rather formal, but few would have found him strange. Yet the air of presumptive importance he carried, his cold, seemingly emotionless face, and the frigid manner with which he treated every Korean he saw made his identity unmistakable. He was an agent of the Japanese government, and he had come to deliver the notice that all of our cabinet had been dreading. “Japan has emerged from its moment of unpleasantness,” he intoned to us. “The Korean situation has been neglected, but we have now prepared to set all affairs in order and restore the Japanese administration.” He gave the King an iron stare, his contempt flashing from his eyes. “Will there be any difficulties in resuming our duties here?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP59.D;The fated hour of confrontation with Japan has come at last. A Japanese flotilla has been spotted approaching the coast, flying their war flag, and bearing straight for us. As our brave soldiers assemble to march into battle, they go with the knowledge that they are fighting to defend nothing less than the very idea of Goryeo. We all must stand up and fight for the sake of our nation, our people, our sovereignty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP60.T;The March of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP60.D;With Japan’s increasing stability, the government has decided that the time has come for us to be fully incorporated into the Empire. As the governor lowers the territory’s flag in the square of the capital, it is a bittersweet moment. While most colonists are glad to be reunited with their mother country-nobody will miss having to defend against raids from the natives-we are all aware that this represents the loss of our status as a true frontier, and the freedom which that status provided. As the flag of Japan is raised over the capital, for the first time with no other banner to accompany it, all who gaze upon it know that things will never be the same again in Ryuukidou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP61.T;The Tokushima Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP61.D;Hozumi Takemori is a samurai from Tokushima Prefecture and a veteran of some fame. A charismatic figure, Hozumi supported reform but was also concerned about the decline of the samurai. Although he proved popular enough to earn a spot in the new administration, he has since grown jaded by the Westernization of the military. After failing to convince the government to pass the Tozama Plan to preserve the samurai, Hozumi resigned, returned home, and founded a private military academy for fellow dissatisfied bushi. The news that these samurai had begun to acquire government positions across Tokushima, however, disturbed us, and soldiers were sent to investigate, as well as to secure the local arsenal. What happened next is disputed, but his supporters claim that soldiers attempted to arrest Hozumi, and his students retaliated, violently expelling them. Hozumi has now rallied the prefecture in rebellion, declaring himself to be the last defender of bushido!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP62.T;The End of the Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP62.D;Our soldiers, after shattering the samurai insurrection, searched for their leader to bring him back to the capital to face trial. It seems, however, that he chose to levy his own punishment upon himself. We found his headless corpse by the seaside, near the site of the last battle, his own blade buried in his stomach. According to a fisherman who observed the battle, Hozumi committed seppuku when the battle was clearly lost, and his attendant, after performing the customary decapitation, flung his head into the sea to prevent the government from being able to conclusively prove his death. This marks the end of the samurai as both a military and a political force in Japan, but the people seem to already be marveling at what they see as a martyred hero and even whisper of him escaping to places like Tawantinsuyu or China. Most of our government scoff at such romanticizing of an embittered rebel, but it seems that Hozumi has won one final battle : the battle for his memory, and that of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP63.T;The Edo Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP63.D;Scholar Nomura Ujikore has always had a reputation for rather strange ideological positions. Having led a group of liberals into the northern mountains to escape the previous government’s violent purge of reformists, Nomura only grew more radical in isolation. Upon return, his advocacy for social and gender equality made him many enemies, yet also led some to see Nomura as the last true republican. His base of support is the city of Edo, where officials had noted with concern the growing membership among workers in Nomura’s so-called “Free Press Party,” a group which has long been suspected as being a front for much more serious radicalism. This proved correct, as Nomura and a small army of followers have taken advantage of a small-scale dockworker strike to launch a rebellion! Armed cadres have seized control of Edo and stormed city hall, where Nomura has read a speech in which he has denounced the government as “the boot stamping upon the necks of the people,” and called for revolution! The revolt is already spreading beyond Edo…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP63.A;Time to stamp out these embers of anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP64.T;The Commune is Crushed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP64.D;As our soldiers fought their way through the barricades erected by Nomura’s fanatics, a small team of marines infiltrated the docks and made their way to Nomura’s headquarters. Taking the exterior guards by surprise, they fought their way through the building room-to-room, until they finally reached Nomura’s office. Though he attempted to commit suicide with a revolver, Captain Tanaka Hayato quickly disarmed and arrested him. By they time they emerged, the city was retaken, and Nomura was brought back to the capital for trial. Representing himself, Nomura spent most of his time railing against the government, denouncing it for “blithely inheriting the cruel attitudes of the past.” Convicted for treason, he was brought before a firing squad in the capital barracks. Reportedly, his final words were…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP64.A;"You have delayed the revolution, but my spark has already lit the flame of ages.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP65.T;The End of the Leased Ports;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP65.D;Over the last few hundred years, our nation’s influence in Japan grew so great among local daimyo that we were able to negotiate the lease of a port city, which became an important enclave. Nagasaki and Yokohama were, along with Osaka, the only truly free-trade ports in Japan, and renowned centers of intellectual and cultural exchange in addition to their status as economic hubs. However, despite this being a negotiated agreement, the Japanese have always felt uneasy about foreigners holding their lands, and it seems that the Japanese government has finally decided not to renew our lease. Their representatives assure us that they will obey the terms of the lease’s early termination clause and reimburse us, though our lawyers protest that exchange rates have changed dramatically since the contract was written and this sum is far lower than what they ought to pay. Regardless, at this point they seem dead set on reclaiming the ports, and to resist them would mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP66.D;In the upheavals which wracked China over the last two hundred years, we, the inheritors of the great Ming, were forced to retreat further and further from the Imperial heartland. Having finally been driven all the way to the island of Taiwan, it seems that even this was not a safe refuge. We have once again come under attack, but this time not from a competitor to the legacy of the Middle Kingdom, but from the Empire of Japan! They have claimed the island which has become our haven, impudently threatening war if we do not hand it over at once. While our officials have prepared emergency evacuation plans to our holdings in Liusung, also known as Tondo, to do this would be a highly traumatic and humiliating affair. Beyond the shame of surrendering to the Japanese without a fight, moving our capital to such distant lands would be seen as all but forfeiting our claim to China. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP68.T;The Saigo Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP68.D;Saigo Ryoma, famous general and founding member of the new regime, has gained a reputation for shrewdness, but he seems to have grown disillusioned with partisanship and decided that the time has come to end the democratic experiment. Today, flanked by stone-faced guards, he read out a pronouncement from the steps of the former Imperial Palace, declaring himself Gensui or “Marshall” and suspending the legislature! This has upended the nation, as Saigo had been trusted to use his influence to keep the military apolitical, not use it to seize power. While most of the military has been quick to pledge allegiance to Saigo, certain bushi have lambasted him for declining to restore the samurai to prominence, while the liberals are aghast at this demolition of Japan’s nascent democracy. The Gensui has already declared his intent to “restore conservatism,” which has not helped matters. With stirrings of rebellion and conspiracy in both the east and the west of the nation, it seems that Japan has not escaped the storm clouds yet…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP68.A;Long live Gensui Saigo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.T;The Saigo Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.D;Disaster was averted today, as several Parliamentary MPs were presented with incontrovertible evidence of a conspiracy led by famous general Saigo Ryoma to seize control of the nation and proclaim himself dictator! After the MPs contacted liberal and trustworthy members of the military to assist them, Saigo and his accomplices were taken by surprise in their homes and immediately made to resign all government positions before being arrested. To prevent panic, the evidence of the conspiracy has been released and distributed among the public, who are shocked but also relieved that the coup was prevented. However, the fact that Saigo was a samurai, and that samurai were heavily involved in his plan, has cast a shadow of suspicion upon them. With the samurai already weakened by the government’s emphasis on military modernization, radicals are beginning to vilify them as arch-reactionary parasites, infuriating the bushi. Worst of all, it is feared that not all conspirators were identified and may still be at large…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.A;Democracy has endured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP70.T;A Republic of Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP70.D;Though the republic was built on a fragile basis of cooperation between liberal scholars and ideologically diverse samurai, it had been hoped that this unlikely coalition could be as successful in peace as it was in war. Sadly, this was not to be. A famous samurai named Hozumi Takemori, once seen as a moderating influence among the bushi, has moved sharply to the right since the republic’s establishment. Fearful of liberalism eroding Japanese culture, he has decided that the fate of the nation cannot be trusted to intellectuals. With the support of samurai across the nation, especially those within the military and the rest of the government, Hozumi has marched on the capital and proclaimed himself to be the new president. He has already issued executive orders resurrecting State Shinto, banning political parties, and implementing various other policies which have horrified liberals. Yet reactionaries and even conservatives seem to adore him, none more so than the bushi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP70.A;The bushido shall endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP71.T;Bakemono;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP71.D;Like the bakemono of Shintoism, the fickle shapeshifting spirits of terrible power, Japan has morphed from a republic into something beyond recognition. The growing tensions between liberal intellectuals and the ideologically diverse samurai proved irreconcilable, and the bushi have decided to act. Prince Fujitaka, a Shinto zealot and youngest brother of former Prince Regent Mitsuhito, fled into exile after the republican victory in the civil war. However, after being contacted by conspiratorial bushi, he has returned in secret. During a meeting of the legislature, the bushi overpowered the guards and burst into the chamber, slaughtering all within. Minutes later, Fujitaka entered Kyoto in a grand parade escorted by the highest members of the military, heading straight to the Imperial Palace where he was enthroned as Emperor-Shogun Kan’ei.\n\n“Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for the Broad Leniency given unto us as your Eternal Leader.

FJAP1.T;Canonization of Father Francisco Garrupe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FJAP1.D;Father Francisco Garrupe was a Portuguese Jesuit priest who helped spread Catholicism to Japan. Prior to his arrival in 1639, his mentor, Joao Ferreira, was rumored to have been executed by the Shimabara daimyo, Arima Yukinaga, and Garrupe infiltrated Shimabara to investigate. After narrowly escaping arrest, he found a samurai named Kirino Hanjiro, who was himself a Kirishitan (secret Christian). Hanjiro confirmed Ferreira’s death before sneaking out of Shimabara to inform Shogun Oda Nobunaga of the situation. Garrupe was soon then captured, tortured, and martyred by Yukinaga. However, Nobunaga, upon hearing Hanjiro’s story, forced Yukinaga to abdicate. The daimyo’s heir Ieyasu, moved by Garrupe’s actions, converted to Catholicism and spread the faith across Shimabara. Many Japanese Catholics have pressed for Garrupe’s canonization, and now the Holy Father has finally seen fit to declare him a saint. Joyous crowds greeted the news in Nagasaki - a port leased by Ieyasu to Spain, and a center of Asian Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW1.T;Voyage of the Dingyuan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW1.D;Marshall Yeng Futing is the rightful leader of both our humble archipelago of Fang Hú and of Qingqiu. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. Although he had been sure of being welcomed by fellow opponents of the Sanbao leviathan, no city opened its harbor to him, and so he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. Futing brought peace and stability to his new realm of Fang Hú, which he has governed ever since. One of his first decrees was an embargo against traitorous Qingqiu, but last night a Qinqiuese ship, the Dingyuan, attempted to smuggle goods into Fang Hú! Fortunately the virtuous Fleet-in-Exile drove them off, but this is yet another reminder that we must not forget our dangerous position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW1.A;Qingqiu, we have not forgotten you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.T;Incident in Fang Hú;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.D;Hawaii is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, distant from most trade routes. For the past few decades, the islands have been ruled as “Fang Hú” by “Marshall” Yeng Futing, a treasonous Qingqiuese naval officer who took command of the rebel fleet in the aftermath of the War of Unification in 1812, then fled to the islands and brutally subjugated them. While some in Qingqiu have argued that our nation has a moral duty to end Futing’s reign, the remoteness of the islands and their lack of strategic value have made them a low priority. However, the nature of their government means that they continue to grab headlines on occasion. This time, a merchant ship named the Dingyuan attempted to anchor off the coast of Fang Hú to conduct business there, only to be chased away by the outsized Fang Hú navy. This incident has once again brought Fang Hú into national discourse, and while public attention will probably fade, the situation remains a nagging issue for Qingqiu’s foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.A;What a bizarre situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.T;House Kalanikupule Escapes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.D;The Kalanikupule family, long the rulers of the island of Maui, were, like most native dynasties of Fang Hú, reduced to mere figureheads under the close eye of the Marshall’s forces. Kept under house arrest and tight surveillance except during major ceremonies, control of the islands’ “ruling” families strengthened Futing’s rule. It appears, however, that these security measures have finally failed. Last night, after what was, according to an interrogated household servant, months of planning, the Kalanikupules gathered their most precious belongings and subdued the guards posted to the night watch of their state-furnished palace. Stealing out into the night, they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship, which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified. According to the lighthouse keeper who reported the incident, the ship that bore them was flying the Scandinavian flag! This has led to rumors swirling that the whole thing was a Scandinavian plot…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.A;Fetch the guards that were supposed to watch them - and a firing squad while you're at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.T;Flight of the House Kalanikupule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.D;A strange tale has reached us from our Christiana colony. A few days ago, one of our Eastern Indies Fleet’s ships, the Hansa, was reported missing, yet Admiral Christian Knuth, head of the Fleet, seemed oddly unconcerned. The whole colony was astonished when the Hansa returned yesterday bearing an entire Jarlsbergsøyenese royal family! Apparently, Protestant missionaries approached Knuth months ago, describing how they had secretly converted members of the Kalanikupule dynasty of Maui Island to Christianity. However, the major families of Jarlsbergsøyene, also known as Fang Hú or Hawaii, were under house arrest by the island’s despot, a rogue Qingqiuese admiral named Yeng Futing. Knuth secretly dispatched the Hansa to aide the Jarlsbergsøyenese in an uprising against Futing. It arrived too late, and the uprising failed, but the Hansa was still able to rescue the dynasty. Some ministers are shocked at Knuth’s recklessness, though others observe that we could use this to our advantage by installing them as rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.A;Very well, don't court marshal him - yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.T;Death of the Marshall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.D;Yeng Futing, great Marshall of Qingqiu and the island of Fang Hú has died. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. With no city revolting to welcome his ships, he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification wars. The Qingqiuese admiral decimated the warring chiefs and their retinues, establishing an oligarchy where only the Qingqiuese officers had power. Futing claimed to be the only true ruler of Qingqiu, although no one took him seriously. His unopposed rule lasted more than 50 years, and already it seems that both the native Hawaians who have become increasingly radicalized due to the harsh treatments imposed by the Chinese oligarchy, and the Qingqiuese settlers want some change in the islands. One wonders how the designated successor of Yeng, Zhang Chen, will handle this new era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.A;A drama in the heart of the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.T;Cabinet Discusses Jarlsbergsøyene;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.D;With the death of the notorious Marshall Yeng Futing, our ministers and military officers have begun to debate whether we should intervene in  Jarlsbergsøyene. Admiral Knuth’s actions have ensured that we have a justification, should we want one : placing the Kalanikupule dynasty on the throne of a united archipelago. The larger question is whether doing so might attract unwanted attention. Qingqiu has always seen “Fang Hú” as part of its diplomatic sphere, albeit a renegade one, and decades of Qingqiuese rule have created a notable minority which wields tremendous political and economic power, so they might also intervene. But, our admirals point to a third contender : the Empire of Japan. Japan’s ambitions in the Pacific are well known, and Futing had occasionally allowed Japanese traders to conduct business in Fang Hú, so they have established a small presence there as well. While Japan is currently unstable, it is probable that they would react if we moved against Jarlsbergsøyene. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.A;Drop the matter, it isn't worth our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.B;We must liberate Jarlsbergsøyene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.T;Marshal Chen Supports Qingqiuese Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.D;With the lack of any forthcoming Scandinavian intervention against Fang Hú, Marshal Zhang Chen assembled the high-ranking military officers and most influential landlords at his palace today, and made a stunning announcement : he intends to convince Qingqiu to annex us! He followed this thunderbolt by explaining his motives – if Fang Hú joins Qingqiu on its own terms, Chen said, then they could obtain Qingqiu’s protection while presenting themselves as a ready-made administration for Sanbao to co-opt. Thus, the ruling elite could preserve much of their power and no longer live in fear of foreign encroachment. This explanation soothed most attendees’ nerves, though the military is restless at the thought of surrendering our independence to the nation that Futing spend fifty years railing against. Still, word has already leaked out into the public, and most Qingqiuese settlers seem to approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.A;It's time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.T;Fang Hú Requests Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.D;Our government was caught off guard when Marshall Zhang Chen, the newest ruler of Fang Hú, sent an envoy to us to request to join our nation! Apparently, the measure has gained rapid support in the archipelago following Futing’s death, and a recent incident with Scandinavia convinced Chen that foreign protection is necessary to safeguard Fang Hú. With a powerful Qingqiuese settler population already existing in Fang Hú, it would probably be simple to integrate them into our country. Several expansionist MPs have quickly drafted a bill of annexation and ensured its swift passage through the legislature, and today Fang Hú became our newest state. The mood was not entirely jubilant, however, as dark rumors have emerged that the Empire of Japan may seek to interfere…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.A;We shall sign the bill into law and celebrate our new Pacific friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.B;A tremendous gesture, but we cannot risk Japan's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.T;Hojo is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.D;To the astonishment of our ministers, both Scandinavia and Qingqiu have shied away from taking control of the Hojo Islands, despite being presented opportunities to do so. Qingqiu is reported to have even voted down a bill of annexation! With no other option and fearing for the future of the archipelago, Marshall Chen has reluctantly approached us and requested our protection. Though he and much of his family will maintain positions of influence across the islands, we have effectively gained control of Hojo without firing a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.A;A bloodless victory is the most sublime kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.B;Those islands are clearly more trouble than they're worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.T;The Hojo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.D;The archipelago of Hojo – known to westerners as Jarlsbergsøyene, to Chinese speakers as Fang Hú, and to natives as Hawaii – has been the object of small Japanese interest for decades. Japan was a major trading partner in Fang Hú and sanctioned by its mercurial Qinqiuese dictator, the rogue admiral Yeng Futing. While our merchant activity was strictly regulated by Futing and his oligarchs, we nevertheless managed to build up a trading presence there. Now, however, our position has been threatened, as the nation of Qingqiu recently passed a bill of Fang Húese annexation! If we want to avoid surrendering our position in Hojo – and potentially opening up nearby Pacific islands to Qingqiuese colonization – we must act swiftly to oppose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.A;We shall not bow to a nation as lowly as Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.B;Let us reconcile with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.T;Japan Declares War over Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.D;When our forefathers smashed the Xiazhou Expedition, the Japanese invasion of Qingqiu, in 4528 Huángdì year (1821 AD by the European calendar), they had warned us that this was not the end – that Japan might one day return. Now, those fears have been proven correct, albeit in a way they likely couldn’t have anticipated. Our annexation of the Fang Hú Islands has provoked the gluttonous Japanese so severely that they have declared war upon us, with the seizure of Fang Hú as their goal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.A;They shall meet the same fate as before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.T;Japan Forfeits Fang Hú;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.D;It seems that the Japanese are even more cowardly than we thought. Though they have issued strenuous diplomatic protests over our annexation of Fang Hú, there has not been any sign of them taking military action against us. The islands are ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.A;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.T;The End of the Oligarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.D;Yeng Futing had always insisted on a firm hand when dealing with the native peoples of Fang Hú, declaring that they would seize any moment of weakness to rise up, even as he demeaned them as primitive savages. It seems that he was right to be paranoid. Just before dawn this morning, a strike force of three Scandinavian men-of-war pulled into Hilo harbor, cannons blazing. In the confusion of the assault, Scandinavian marines travelled north by boat away from the heat of the fighting, then made landfall and snuck into the city. Just as Marshall Chen was informed of the invasion, the marines – led by Prince 'Iolani Kalanikupule – fought their way into the palace and took Chen by surprise as he was escaping. Chen died in a shootout in the palace gardens, and soon Scandinavian reinforcements arrived to secure the capital. News of the invasion spread across the islands, igniting a deluge of native uprisings which have shattered the Qingqiuese dominion. 'Iolani has been enthroned as King of a united Hawaii, backed by Scandinavian firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW14.D;Traders operating in the South China Sea had brought back rumors of a Scandinavian plot to restore native Hawaiian rule in Fang Hú, and it seems that these rumors were correct. Scandinavian warships blasted their way into the capital city of Hilo, shattering the vaunted Fleet-in-Exile and allowing a team of marines led by a Hawaiian prince to execute Marshall Zhang Chen and initiate an archipelago-wide revolution against the Qingqiuese settlers. The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King ‘Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Expansionists across Qingqiu are already calling upon us to save the Qingqiuese of the islands, and rescue them from what can only be the prelude to full Scandinavian annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW15.T;Pro-Scandinavian Coup in Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW15.D;Officials in Osaka, during their patrols of the Scandinavian part of the foreign merchant district, have overheard rumors of a Scandinavian plot to restore native Hawaiian rule in Fang Hú, and it seems that these rumors were correct. Scandinavian warships blasted their way into the capital city of Hilo, shattering the Fleet-in-Exile and allowing a team of marines led by a Hawaiian prince to execute Marshall Zhang Chen and initiate an archipelago-wide revolution against the Qingqiuese settlers. The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King ‘Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Our traders have already begun returning to Japan, demanding that the government take action to defend both Japanese economic rights and our national honor, and the navy seems quite sympathetic to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW15.B;Merchants do not control our foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW16.T;The Jarlsbergsøyenese Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW16.D;Prince – now King – ‘Iolani was quite happy with our government’s vast amount of military aid supplied to enthrone him as the first native monarch of the Jarlsbergsøyenese islands, but perhaps he should have read the fine print of our agreement a bit more closely. A Scandinavian “resident” has been appointed to oversee the Kingdom’s affairs, Scandinavian merchants have been granted extraordinary privileges throughout the archipelago, and, since the Fang Hú military was largedly arrested or killed during the anti-Qingqiuese revolution, the only truly organized military presence on the islands is the Scandinavian military. With no sign of foreign interference in sight, there is little reason to maintain the fiction of native rule any longer. ‘Iolani may keep his title, informally, but he and his dynasty shall once more be figureheads within the new Jarlsbergsøyenese protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW17.T;Qingqiu Declares War over Jarlsbergsøyene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW17.D;Our efforts to take control of Jarlsbergsøyene did not go unnoticed in Sanbao. The Qingqiuese have expressed outrage at our “invasion” of Fang Hú – never mind that it was done to overthrow the regime that had been their enemy for over half a century. Qingqiu has already laid claim to the islands, based upon the Qinqqiuese settler population (or what’s left of it after the native uprising), and is mobilizing its military for an invasion of the archipelago. It seems that we must fight for our newest acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW17.A;Let them try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW18.T;The Fang Hú War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW18.D;Scandinavia has flatly refused to withdraw from Fang Hú! Our government is already receiving reports of the horrific atrocities inflicted by the savage natives upon the innocent Qingqiuese settlers across the islands, and our population is outraged. Worse, Scandinavia has begun entrenching their occupation of the islands to prepare for our retaliation. Only war can avenge those slaughtered by the machinations of Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW19.T;Japan Declares War over Jarlsbergsøyene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW19.D; Our efforts to take control of Jarlsbergsøyene did not go unnoticed in Sanbao. The Japanese have expressed outrage at the “ruination” our invasion of Fang Hú inflicted upon their merchants – likely since they were one of the prime business partners of the brutal despot Futing. Japan has ignored any of our offers to (have ‘Iolani) reimburse their merchants for the damages and is mobilizing its military for an invasion of the archipelago. It seems that we must fight for our newest acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW21.T;A Conference in Honolulu?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW21.D;The announcement by both Qingqiu and Japan of their intent to claim Jarlsbergsøyen threatens to ignite a three-way war in the Pacific. In order to avert this, King ‘Iolani has called for a diplomatic conference of all three involved powers, to be hosted by himself and his government in the town of Honolulu, long a favored port by foreign merchants. ‘Iolani’s aim is to negotiate Hawaiian neutrality, preserving it as a nation open to all the world’s trade but not owned or dominated by any foreign power. While this could be a major diplomatic opportunity, it would also mean forgoing any attempt to claim the islands for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW24.T;The Treaty of Honolulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW24.D;Though Qingqiu sought to restore the settlers’ dominion over Hawaii, though Scandinavia schemed to deprive it of its liberty, though Japan made plans to conquer it, King ‘Iolani Kalanikupule has outsmarted them all. Knowing that the only thing more tempting than a subjugated Hawaii was denying their rivals a victory, he bet on all three powers’ mutual distrust – and won. In the Conference of Honolulu, attended by all three powers as well as the King and his council, and which shall go down in the annals of diplomatic history, Hawaii has become a truly neutral nation. Though the King has renounced the nation’s right to wage war or to enter military alliances, in return he has obtained international recognition of Hawaii as a nation safeguarded by international law. Furthermore, Japan, Qingqiu, and Scandinavia have all renounced their claims to the islands, and have mutually guaranteed its independence. As the signatories put pen to page, King ‘Iolani declared that Hawaii and its guarantors were now an ohana, a family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW24.A;And family means that nobody gets left behind or forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW25.D;To King ‘Iolani’s dismay, Japan, Qingqiu, and Scandinavia could not all countenance an independent and neutral Hawaii.

HAW28.T;Fang Hu subjugated;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW28.D;For decades, the brutal reign of Marshal Yeng Futing over the Hawaii’an archipelago resulted in international embarrassment for the Qingquiese government. Though costly, in $YEAR$, the Qingquiese navy arrived and assumed control of the main islands in a quick but relatively bloodless campaign. Many citizens cheered when the news broke that the Marshal had been dethroned. On the islands, however, the natives were wary of our arrival but those emerging in their leadership appeared willing to negotiate with us. The Marshal was arrested after a standoff inside his “Presidential Palace” and sent off to San Bao where he will await trial. With Fang Hu now under our direct control, we must decide what to do with the islands while the international community is busy with strife in Europe and our rival across the sea is too weak to do anything about it. Military experts suggest the island will be invaluable for naval supremacy in the Pacific, while others appeal to the plight of the Native Hawaiians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW29.T;Fang Hu subjugated;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW29.D;The bizarre “country” of Fang Hu, which seemed more like a pirate haven than it did a legitimate government, has been effortlessly subjugated by the %country% navy. In a brief exchange in the Honolulu harbor, Marshal Yeng Futing was quartered fleeing the scene of the initial landing. After convincing the locals not to inflict “multiple stab wounds” with a pahoa, Yeng Futing was taken into custody by %country% officials. The Quingquiese government has requested that we grant them extra-territoriality rights to try the Marshall by their laws, given the fact that he was a rogue officer responsible for many atrocities. While others with ambitions in the Pacific have been quick to protest our abrupt occupation of the islands, we can at least procure some good will with our Arcadian neighbor. Improving relations with the Quingquiese may prove incalculable.;;;;;;;;;;;;

HAW30.T;Trial of the ‘Marshal’ of Fang Hu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW30.D;In the year of $YEAR$,  the terrible regime Yeng Futing created in the Hawaiian islands was vanquished by $FROMCOUNTRY$! Quingquiese dreams of conquering the islands faded, quickly replaced by the public interest in the trial of the “Grand Marshal”. Though expected to be short, the Marshal planned a ridiculous defense while the prosecution had gathered quite the witness list: Natives from the islands, defectors from the regime, and even a $FROMCOUNTRY$ representative to recount the atrocities he had committed as Grand Marshal.The Trial of Yeng Futing was a complicated, public spectacle. The Marshal went on a tirade looking for every procedural error to be found. After calling the entire court rigged, claiming a grand conspiracy existed in the government to “enslave, rape and assimilate” the natives of Hawaii, he even accused the Judge of “enjoying the company of young men and boys”. By the end of it, the Jury, visibly exhausted, found Yeng Futing guilty of every single charge. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

claim_xiazhou_desc;In 10 Komei (1820 AD by the Western calendar), the city-state of San Bao sought to centralize all of Qingqiu under its control. The chaos that this provoked inspired Japan to attempt to seize the coastal region of Xiazhou. The expedition was a disaster – our logistics proved totally inadequate, every European power with any influence in Arcadia aided the Qingqiuans against us, and the daring attempt by Admiral Yusumoto’s marines to seize the harbor in preparation for taking the city itself led to a vicious street battle in which his whole unit was annihilated. The wounds of this shame upon both the honor of our military and the honor of our nation have never healed. Now, however, the situation has changed. Arcadia is divided and Europe is eating itself alive, whereas Japan is stronger than ever. The time has come to take revenge upon Qingqiu and finish what we started. The rich lands of Xiazhou shall soon be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

man_in_the_castle_desc;Ever since the failure of the Xiazhou Expedition against the city-states of what would become Qingqiu in 10 Komei (1821 by the barbarian calendar), we have known that our national honor could only be recovered through revenge. For decades, the presidents of Qingqiu have defied us, not simply slandering us with their diplomats and undercutting us with their merchants, but by actively plotting our downfall. It is in that infernal presidential palace, the High Castle of Sanbao, where the greatest enemy of the Japanese people lies in wait. We can tolerate the schemes of Qingqiu no longer! The time has come to take up arms and slay the beast across the ocean, to consign Qingqiu itself to the graveyard of history. Their lands are rich and abundant, and our settlers shall make great use of them. As for the existing residents, well…we shall have to find some solution for them. But, enough of the future! Let us plunge our blades into Qingqiu’s vile heart! Tennhoku Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_kamejima_expedition_desc;The Imperial Japanese Navy has long sought to expand Japan’s presence in the Pacific Ocean. However, the limited range of Japanese vessels restricted our overseas administrative capacity. The acquisition of the Hojo Islands, however, has gone a long way towards fixing this problem. As such, the IJN has now put forth a bold plan to seize the far-flung Amerigan archipelago of the Galapagos Islands, known to us as the Kamejima Islands (both meaning “Tortoise Islands”). Though most famous for their spectacular flora and fauna, control of Kamejima would give us an outpost in the southern Pacific and serve as a base to further expand our influence in Ameriga and Arcadia. It just so happens that a small Japanese merchant ship is scheduled to pass by the Galapagos on its way to an Amerigan port. If it were to, say, mysteriously explode as it passed by them, we would have no recourse but to defend ourselves from the islands’ current owner, who would clearly have attacked us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In short, the Andagoya Canal must be prevented from being built, by any means necessary. Andagoya itself is currently held by another power, but our spies have devised a plan. We have contacted a noteworthy Andagoyan politician, one Juan Eligio Mallarino, who is known to be both ambitious and corrupt. He has agreed to lead a pro-Japanese coup in Andagoya, so long as we ensure a prominent place for him in the forthcoming administration.

A new Andagoyan government shall be formed, one built upon tradition and friendly to Japanese interests, starting with new laws to protect the Japanese kokutai in Andagoya. A strip of territory in central Andagoya shall be annexed directly to Japan, not to build a canal as the delusional barbarians dream of but instead to safeguard the region and protect it from such mad schemes.

Yet Rusun is currently held by a foreign power, one who is not inclined to part with it. This cannot stand! Rusun must be Japanese – but the Japanese people seem to be unaware of Rusun’s importance.

The men of the Kyowakai Society argue that China’s state of disorder, compared to Japan’s newfound unity, is proof that the Chinese have lost the ability to maintain a harmonious and peaceful realm. Moreover, the intrusion of European Great Powers into China’s economy (and, lately, their coastal territory) is a threat to the Asian balance of power and to Japan’s financial stability. The Kyowakai Society seeks to advance Japanese hegemony as the solution to these problems – whether by diplomatic pressure, propaganda, or subterfuge, they shall stop at nothing to secure our position in China.

Simple : as the foremost Asian power, one built upon the foundation of democracy and with few stakes in Europe’s affairs, we are the most reliable guardian of East Asian trade and thus should be recognized as its guarantor. Obviously, this would necessitate our taking control of the Chinese cities most involved in the East Asian economy, but this is strictly to prevent further violence. Suffice to say, this is likely to be a difficult concept for the Great Powers to accept, but so long as we publicize the concept we should have a solid foundation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_title;The Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_desc;Sangoku (lit. “Three Countries”) is a concept which has existed in Japanese philosophy from before contact with Europe. It identifies Honshu (the largest island in Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India) as part of a single spiritual and cultural continuum. However, the phrase has begun to be used by Japanese political scientists to describe something more complex, namely Japan’s obligation to culturally unite Asia and dismantle European colonialism throughout the continent. These “pan-Asianists” argue that Japan, having thrown off the shackles of theocratic monarchy and feudalism while still maintaining our unique national character, has achieved a level of cultural development above that of Europe. Therefore, we ought to take the lead and guide Asia into common prosperity. Naturally, adopting this as government policy will outrage Europe – but, let them howl! Asia is for Asians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_southern_embassy_title;The Southern Embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_southern_embassy_desc;The “Southern Embassy” is one of Japan’s most venerable diplomatic offices, the one located in the overseas Chinese state of Zhourao. One of the most distant outposts of Japanese trade, Japanese-Zhourao relations have been complicated by both the distance involved and the cultural disconnection between our societies. Yet as both Japan and Zhourao begin to recognize a greater sense of national responsibility, perhaps we could find a common purpose in securing stability within the Pacific Ocean. We shall attempt to form a military alliance with Zhourao – if they accept then it may enable us to greatly increase our influence in their nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_title;Propose the Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_desc;Japan has maintained diplomatic and economic connections with the southern overseas Chinese state of Zhourao for centuries, but most of these ties have been of little importance. However, the arrival of a European colonial power onto the continent and its occupation of the region of Zuharra has cast our relations with Zhourao in a new light. Our military believes that we may be able to sway the Zhourao government into forming a military alliance for the purpose of driving out the Europeans and securing Zuharra for Zhourao. If successful, then we may be able to ingratiate ourselves within the Zhourao military, as well as its political and economic elite. Perhaps those connections could, in turn, open up the possibility of establishing a more...friendly Zhourao regime. Let us draw in a group of visiting Zhourao diplomats into the city of Kagoshima for a series of secret discussions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
puppet_zhourao_title;The Zhourao Chrysanthemum Society Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
puppet_zhourao_desc;Our liberation of Zuharra has made Japan quite celebrated in Zhourao. However, it has not only brought us popularity – it has also given us the chance to make valuable connections with Zhourao’s military, political, and economic establishment. We have drawn the most Japanophilic  Zhourao elite into a single organization, the Chrysanthemum Society (named for a flower often associated with Japan). This Society has extolled Japan’s virtues in public, but in private has been preparing for a coup to create a government more favorable to Japan’s interests. In exchange, all members of the Society shall find themselves handsomely rewarded after the revolution. We have just received word that the plan is ready to be put into action. Of course, if it fails, the Zhourao people will be outraged. and we shall likely be drawn into open warfare with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_zhourao_title;The Lands of Red and Gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_zhourao_desc;Zhourao is a land which at first glance seems to be barren, but which in truth holds tremendous riches. Whoever possesses Zhourao shall find wealth beyond imagination, if they can endure its hazards. Yet Zhourao is currently possessed by a dishonorable and undeserving people, barbaric Chinese settlers who have squatted upon the land for generations, and who have cobbled together a feeble edifice that they dare to call a government. The time has come for the great Japanese people to sweep this flotsam back into the sea where it came from, and take the mighty southern continent for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.T;Victory in Xiazhou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.D;At last, the humiliation of the past has been avenged! Qingqiu has been driven from Xiazhou and they have finally conceded that the war is lost. The Qingqiuans have signed a peace treaty ceding Xiazhou to us, and the only question now is what to do with it. Hokkaigan has petitioned us to place the area under their control, citing their geographic proximity and the history of Hokkaiganese fishermen, hunters, and traders ranging south into Xiazhou (one of the sources for our claim on the area in the first place). However, a few more…cautious members of the military have proposed maintaining direct rule over Xiazhou. They argue that, should Qingqiu retaliate or Hokkaigan repudiate their allegiance in the future, having a Japanese garrison in the area would be preferable. Still, these men are a tiny minority and most officials agree that Hokkaigan should receive the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.A;Transfer Xiazhou to Hokkaigan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.B;Hokkaigan is untrustworthy, maintain direct rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.T;The Fate of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.D;As the last guns fall silent across western Arcadia, the banner of Qingqiu is nowhere to be seen – the Rising Sun dominates all, from the verdant forests of Xiazhou to the vast city of Sanbao. The question of the hour is how we shall administer these newly conquered lands. The current plan is to create a client state known as “Dayan” to control the interior of Qingqiu, controlled by Japanese officials but employing sufficiently vetted and obedient Qingqiuans, one of whom would rule Dayan as a dictator in our name. We would retain direct control of the Qingqiuese coast. More extreme ministers, however, believe that relying on Qingqiuans in any capacity is both dangerous and beneath our dignity, and demand total annexation of Qingqiu. The Imperial Army has expressed concerns about being able to effectively police the eastern frontier should direct rule be fully imposed, but the final decision lies with the Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.A;Konnichiwa, Dayan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.T;All of Qingqiu shall be ours and ours alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.T;A Crisis in Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.D;Lately, we have been deluged by complaints from government officials in the former Qingqiu. The exact nature of these complaints varies – insufficient resources, poor communication, rudimentary infrastructure, and an unruly local populace – but the conclusion is that we simply cannot efficiently administer the Qingqiuan interior. The work required to fix these problems could take decades but we are already running out of time. The tone of these complaints has become fearful and alarmed, and the situation in the Arcadian frontier has become critical. Entire towns have ceased reporting in, military outposts have come under attack from well-organized Qingqiuan militias, and patrols that head too far into the Mingxing Mountains have not returned. §RMany ministers believe that the creation of Dayan is the only way to prevent a total collapse of law and order.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.A;We must create Dayan to prevent chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.B;Have the eastern bureaucrats tried whining less?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.T;Anarchy in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.D;The worst fears of the Imperial Japanese Army have been realized : Qingqiu has burst into open rebellion. Ex-Qingqiuan general Hong Shikai has emerged from hiding in the Mingxing Mountains and declared the Second Qingqiuan Federal Republic with himself as its provisional president. This announcement triggered a cascade of uprisings across the frontier, which have totally overwhelmed our administration. Region after region has been seized, either by Shikai’s militias, or by insurrectionary bands of farmers and miners who have pledged varying degrees of loyalty to Shikai. Our garrisons have had to fall back to the western coast as a tsunami of resurgent Qingqiuan nationalism threatens to sweep us back into the Pacific. We are preparing a response to this calamity, but such preparations take time, and meanwhile, Shikai is making his own preparations…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.T;Yet more filth to eradicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.T;The Third Japanese-Qingqiuan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.D;Japan’s aspirations to conquer all of Qingqiu without compromise has allowed a Qingqiuan insurgency to morph into a full-fledged revolution. General Hong Shikai leads an insurrectionary army towards Sanbao, seeking to drive Japan out of the coast and reclaim Qingqiu’s lost lands. If Japan were to be defeated at this juncture, the whole Empire could be placed in jeopardy. The stage is set for what may either be Qingqiu’s resurrection or its funeral dirge. Western Arcadia burns with the fires of war once again as Shikai marches to the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.A;Death to Qingqiu! Tennhoku Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.T;Victory over Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.D;The brave warriors of Japan have won yet another glorious victory! Shikai’s aspirations and his armies lie shattered across western Arcadia, having fallen upon the blades of the Imperial Army. As we bury our dead and resume our administration of the frontier, we are once again confronted with the question of administration. Many believe that this rebellion is proof that the creation of Dayan is necessary for stability. Some go so far as to argue that we should further decentralize by creating a colonial dominion in Hokkaigan as well. Of course, the hardliners argue once again that only Japan can be trusted to rule these places, and it must be said that the insurgency and subsequent revolt have not inspired confidence in the trustworthiness of the Qingqiuans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.A;Dayan will bring stability to this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.B;Dayan and Hokkaigan, loyal daughters of Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.C;Why would we give authority to such traitorous people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC7.T;Stalemate in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC7.D;Though both Japan and Qingqiu have struggled mightily to claim victory, neither side has been able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. With no other option, the Tenno has consented to the signing of an armistice with the rebel leader, General Hong Shikai. Shikai shall administer the frontier as an independent Qingqiu, while the western coast shall remain in Japan’s possession. As many Qingqiuans depart to seek shelter in Shikai’s resurrected nation, the Tenno leaves Arcadia behind and turns his minds to other, hopefully more fruitful pursuits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC7.A;At least we still have Sanbao…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.T;The Rebirth of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.D;To the astonishment of all, Qingqiu has destroyed the Japanese invaders! Just when all hope seemed lost, General Hong Shikai arose from his stronghold in Mingxingshan to liberate the Qingqiuan people. Now the armies of the so-called “Emperor” of Japan have been thoroughly cleansed from the nation, and their feeble colonial administration has crumbled. Shikai has entered Sanbao, the streets thronged by thousands upon thousands of cheering citizens even as certain neighborhoods still smolder from the fighting. Much work must be done to heal the nation from this unprecedented ordeal, but all children of Zhongguo may rest easy tonight knowing that Qingqiu has once again defeated Japan’s mad aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.A;Long live Shikai! Long live Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.T;The Galapagos Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.D;Japanese natural scientists have taken quite an interest in the Galapagos Islands lately, making all sorts of geographical surveys of the area. This has begun to unnerve our navy, which suspects that these scientific missions are a pretext for more sinister purposes. A naval patrol was heading to the Galapagos to set up an outpost there when word was received of a sinking Japanese ship. It appears that the SS Yamasa, a merchant vessel bound for Tawantinsuyu, suffered a mysterious explosion near the islands. While much of the crew was able to evacuate and take shelter on the islands until they could be rescued, the Japanese press has seized upon the event with jingoistic fury. Declaring that our nation sunk the Yamasa with a mine, war-minded men across Japan are calling for nothing less than the Japanese conquest of the Galapagos Islands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.A;This is insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.T;The Andagoyan Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.D;Ever since Japan’s seizure of the Galapagos Islands, rumors have been swirling in Andagoya of the presence of Japanese spies. The Japanese commercial presence in Andagoya has certainly increased. Furthermore, Juan Eligio Mallarino, a notorious Andagoyan rail baron, has hosted numerous meetings with Japanese businessmen and has taken an attractive Japanese mistress. These threads have finally come together into a full-blown conspiracy. This morning, a small army of private soldiers loyal to Mallarino stormed the city of Balboa, whereupon Mallarino appeared at the steps of Balboa city hall and declared the independence of the Republic of Andagoya with himself as provisional president! Japan has immediately recognized Andagoyan independence and has pledged to dispatch a “protection” force to Andagoya at once. Our own forces are ready to crush this rebellion but if we do so then Japan will probably declare war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.A;Damn the Japanese, Mallarino is a traitor and must be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.B;It seems that we must bid farewell to Andagoya…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC13.T;The Andagoya Canal Moratorium;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC13.D;Japan’s recent occupation of Andagoya came as a shock to nations around the world, but this has proven to merely be the prelude to even more astonishing news. The Japanese foreign ministry has published a declaration signed by the Japanese Emperor himself, declaring a ban on all attempts to construct a canal through the Isthmus of Andagoya! Numerous reasons were cited, from “the potential to cause irreversible harm to the local environment” to “the unpredictable consequences upon Andagoyan society from geographic bifurcation.” Stock markets across Europe and Arcadia have tumbled as investors frantically reevaluate their assets in the Western Hemisphere, while politicians rage against this unilateral action by the Empire of Japan to strangle Arcadian commerce. The door to scientific and commercial progress in southern Arcadia seems to have been decisively closed, held firm by the iron grip of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC13.A;Has Japan declared war on innovation itself!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous reasons were cited, from “the potential to cause irreversible harm to the local environment” to “the unpredictable consequences upon Andagoyan society from geographic bifurcation.” As Arcadian stock markets tumble, merchants across Tawantinsuyu have celebrated this measure. The Andagoyan canal project was seen as a dire threat to the Quechua economy, but now the ships of the world shall continue to visit the ports of Tawantinsuyu on their journeys around Ameriga. While Arcadians are enraged at this unilateral action by Japan to strangle their commerce, the merchants of Tawantinsuyu raise a glass to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC131.A;…though Andagoya would be better off under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Issues Andagoyan Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.D;Our presence in Andagoya has infuriated many countries across Arcadia and Europe, and $FROMCOUNTRY_GET_NAME$ in particular. They have denounced our actions as “unilateralism of the knife and the gun,” and “the international equivalent of a bandit’s toll.” Now, they have moved beyond libel and slander and graduated to serious threats. Their diplomatic representative has presented an ultimatum, approved by the highest levels of their government, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Japanese government and military assets from Andagoya, the exile of Mallarino, and the establishment of a free Andagoyan government. Given their prior rhetoric, this is a ludicrous hypocrisy, but the specter of war with their nation is one which merits serious consideration. Some more pessimistic observers have gone so far as to deem Andagoya “indefensible.";;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.A;Prepare a white kimono for our foreign minister...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.B;The only thing “indefensible” is their cowardly bluster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.D;The Japanese resisted our demand vigorously, but in the end they proved to be a paper tiger. Their forces have disappeared from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom they installed to rule Andagoya, has fled into exile to escape the wrath of the people that he sought to lord over. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.A;All’s well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.T;The $COUNTRY$-Japanese War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.D;Japan has categorically refused any attempts to even discuss the matter of their occupation of Andagoya or the moratorium on canal construction. They have stated that it is a “matter of national security and economic survival,” and reiterate that the possible damage a canal might cause locally and to the Amerigan and the Pacific economies is too great a risk to take. The public has already been fanned into a fury with lurid reports of Japanese abuses towards the Andagoyans, so now, there is no turning back : the $COUNTRY$-Japanese War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.A;Andagoya shall be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.D;The Japanese occupation of Andagoya has finally been defeated! The last remnants of their forces have withdrawn from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom the Japanese installed, was caught while trying to flee to Tawantinsuyu disguised as a peddler. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. Its first order of business was to place Mallarino on trial for treason - he was convicted, and subsequently executed by firing squad. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC18.T;The End of the Andagoya Canal Moratorium;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC18.D;When Japan seized Andagoya and banned the construction of a canal across the isthmus, the world reacted with varying degrees of shock. European and Arcadian merchants were outraged, while Amerigans seemed rather pleased. However, it was $FROMCOUNTRY$ which reacted most severely : they issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw from Andagoya, and, after prevailed in the crisis, have asserted diplomatic hegemony over the region. As the Japanese Imperial Court reels from this catastrophic loss of face, it seems inevitable that $FROMCOUNTRY$ shall soon commence construction of the canal which Japan expended so much blood and treasure striving to prevent from being built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC19.T;Japan Offers to Buy Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.D;Japan’s interest in the island of Formosa is well known. Positioned close to the Japanese Home Islands, its possession has long been held as a requirement by nearly all Japanese expansionists and foreign policy advocates. Japan has now come forward with a request to purchase the island from us. They are offering a sizable sum, but the colony’s strategic position cannot be ignored, and its acquisition will not only strengthen Japan but also embolden it to embark on further expansionist projects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.A;Make the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.B;Formosa is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.T;Japan Offers to Buy Brunei;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.D;As Japan continues to build its colonial empire, our holding in Brunei has come to their attention. They seek a port in the East Indies, and have thus come forward with an offer to buy the whole Brunei colony. While our nation has sadly seen its own international presence decline, we might be able to use this opportunity to free ourselves of an unprofitable colony and infuse some money into our coffers. On the other hand, this will inevitably strengthen Japan and may open the door for further Japanese expansion into the East Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.A;We need the money, do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.B;Brunei is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC23.T;Rusun is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC23.D;At last, the northernmost part of the land the Europeans call the Christianer Archipelago has come under our control! Though this marks yet another victory for Japan, it seems that the political attention of our nation is already drifting to other places. Rusun may not command the same level of focus as it recently has, but it shall still remain an important part of our colonial empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC24.T;Japan Demands the Maniolas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.D;For years, Asian experts in our nation have watched the steady expansion of Japan’s colonial empire in Asia with growing alarm. Alas, it appears that their vigilance was warranted, for Japan has now seen fit to place our territories in the Christianer Islands in their sights. An ultimatum has been delivered to our government by Japan, demanding nothing less than the full and immediate cession of the Maniolas under threat of war. The close proximity of the colonies to Japan would make them quite difficult to defend, but can our nation really afford such a monumental humiliation as to cede the whole area without a fight? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.A;We don’t have a choice…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC25.A;We shall crush them easily!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.T;Japanese Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.D;Many deemed it impossible. Many dismissed the notion that a people as primitive, backwards, or inferior as the Japanese could ever challenge Scandinavian might. Today, many people have been proven wrong. Japan has bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our holdings in the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Scandinavia : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by an Asian one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.A;Scandinavia’s future grows ever dimmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.T;Scandinavian Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.D;The worst fears of our nation, of our people, have been proven correct. Scandinavia, for all the rumors of their feebleness, has triumphed. They have bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our claims to the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Japan : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by a European one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC27.T;Formation of the Kyowakai Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.D;The Kyowakai, or “Concordia,” Society has been formed in Japan. Despite its innocuous-sounding name, the group exists to advance Japan’s imperialist interests against China in the name of social progress and economic development. With a growing array of lobbyists, sympathetic media outlets, agents provocateur, and wealthy supporters, the Kyowakai Society will stop at nothing to drive the spear of Japanese imperialism into the bosom of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.A;Yet more suffering on the horizon for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.T;The Kyowakai Society Targets Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.D;The Kyowakai Society has turned their propaganda machine towards us, seeking to push Japan into conflict to penetrate our markets. They slander us in their newspapers, libel us with their politicians, and infiltrate us with their agents. Matters came to a head recently, as a diplomatic incident occurred when a group of Japanese merchants connected to Kyowakai were caught up in a local criminal investigation in one of our port cities. The merchants allege that they were abused, mistreated, and defrauded by our “barbaric and savage mockery of a legal code,” and the Kyowakai Society has seized upon the incident as demonstrating the need for Japan to intervene in our affairs and “defend the honor” of the merchants. Suffice to say, war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matters came to a head recently, as a diplomatic incident occurred when a group of Japanese merchants connected to Kyowakai were caught up in a local criminal investigation in one of our concession cities. The merchants allege that they were abused, mistreated, and defrauded by our “barbaric and savage mockery of a legal code,” and the Kyowakai Society has seized upon the incident as demonstrating the need for Japan to “assume control” of the port and “defend the honor” of the merchants. Suffice to say, war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC29.A;THEY are calling US barbaric!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.T;The Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.D;The continued competition for influence in China leaves the Great Powers in a situation of perpetual struggle, always stepping on one another’s toes within the East Asian market. Seeking to end the cycle of confrontation, the Japanese Republic has called a conference in the city of Nagoya to discuss the situation of Chinese trade, and the role of the Great Powers within it. At least, that’s what they claimed that it would be about. However, over the course of the conference, it became clear to all attendees that Japan was seeking nothing less than international ratification of its role as exclusive guarantor, protector, and regulator of Chinese trade! While Japan has promised to be “impartial, courteous, honorable, and just” in its duties as “enlightened guide” of Chinese trade, the implications of such international sanctioning would be nothing less than approval to monopolize China’s maritime trade and the surrender of our influence in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.A;We trust the Japanese, approve the measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.B;This is preposterous! Recall our diplomats at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.T;The Nagoya Conference Succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.D;To the astonishment of even our most optimistic ministers, the Nagoya Conference has ended splendidly! Japan’s role as guardian of Chinese trade has been approved by the consent of all other Great Powers involved in the region. A new era of peace and prosperity in East Asia begins as the Japanese Republic assumes the natural role of impartial arbiter of Chinese commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.A;Well…theoretically impartial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.T;Failure of the Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.D;Although the Great Powers had hoped to come to an agreement on Chinese trade, they proved unreceptive to the notion of Japan taking control of it. So unreceptive, in fact, that as soon as they understood this to be our goal, they withdrew from the conference immediately. As foreign diplomats from around the world rapidly depart from Nagoya, our government is left with few options. We know that we are the only ones who can be trusted to safeguard Chinese trade, but it seems that the rest of the world remains ignorant. They seem to be unaware that our main goal is peace in East Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.A;Well, then, the world must learn of our peaceful ways…BY FORCE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.T;Japan Announces the Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.D;Sangoku, or “Three Countries,” is a phrase which has been used to describe the region of “Asia” before the notion was introduced by European geographers. In its original usage, it refers to Honshu (the largest island of Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India). Lately, however, it has become a byword among Japanese political scientists for pan-Asian solidarity against European imperialism in Asia. The Japanese Republic has now adopted Sangoku as its official policy. Academic distinctions aside, the direct consequences of this is nothing less than Japan declaring open hostility to all regimes holding colonies in Asia. Anybody could now become a target for Japan’s wrath in the name of pan-Asianism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.A;Why do all republics succumb to bloodlust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.T;Sangoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.D;Japan, China, and India : the Sangoku, the three pillars of Asian civilization, all part of one common home. Yet the Western powers wage war upon the Sangoku, upon not only the peoples of Asia but against human beauty and cultural community. We must resist them! The time has come for us to strike back against the foreigners and to defend the peoples of Asia in the name of solidarity. Our military has identified one country in particular whose colonies may be ready for liberation. However, we might find it more prudent to bide our time before striking. Of course, there are always those who argue that a militant interpretation of Sangoku is hypocritical and that the best way to pursue it would be through diplomatic and economic pressure instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.A;Pan-Asianism demands that we take action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.B;We must make further preparations first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.C;The time has come to adopt a new approach to Sangoku.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.T;An Alliance with Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.D;While Japan lies in the northern Pacific, far from our home in the south, they have been seeking to expand their diplomatic influence throughout the region. As a result, Japanese diplomats have come forward and proposed a military alliance between our nations. They argue that Zhourao and Japan have further enough fields of interest that we would not conflict with one another, that we are both Asian peoples and thus opposed to European imperialism, and that we would both benefit from having a partner on the other end of the Pacific. The idea is tempting, but we should be wary of being drawn int Japan’s foreign adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.A;The Japanese shall surely be trustworthy allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.B;Let us remain merely good neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.T;The Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.D;Our diplomatic delegation to Japan has been unexpectedly drawn into a series of high-level meetings with the Japanese government in the city of Kagoshima. It seems that the Japanese are seeking an alliance with Zhourao – and they are willing to help us unify the continent. Currently, the western region of Zuharra is occupied by a third party, a foreign power whom Zhourao might not be able to beat on our own. Japan’s help would be a tremendous advantage, but we should be mindful of Japan’s motives. Placing ourselves so totally in their confidence could allow them to gain vast sway over our politics and our economy and might even jeopardize our sovereignty in the future. Yet still, Zuharra beckons, and this might be an excellent chance to liberate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.A;Together we march to Zuharra!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.B;We will unify the continent by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.T;The Zuharran War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.D;It was somewhat expected that Zhourao would one day strike against our colony on the western side of the continent, seeing as how they have traditionally claimed the region even if they could not enforce said claim. There has, however, been an unexpected development : Japan and Zhourao have formed an alliance for the purpose of driving us out of the continent and bringing Zuharra under Zhourao’s control! There is no time to negotiate, Zhourao scouts have already been sighted along the coast and the Japanese fleet has been spotted heading south towards the continent. If we want to keep Zuharra then we shall have to fight to defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.A;All of this trouble for ZUHARRA, of all places?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.T;A Japanese Sunrise over Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.D;There’s a popular European saying : “If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true.” Unfortunately, it appears that Japan’s agreement to help us liberate Zuharra fits that bill. A group of pro-Japanese military officers, backed by treasonous politicians and businessmen, have been circulating propaganda accusing the current regime of weakness and immorality, while praising Japan’s rapid economic and political advancement. They have now put their Japanophilia into practice, marching on the capital and seeking to install a pro-Japan regime! If successful, they will likely sign over vast amounts of Zhourao’s political and economic sovereignty to Japan, reducing us to a puppet state. However, rumors are swirling that Japan has already dispatched reinforcements to bolster the coup. Even if we defeat the insurrection, Japan may take matters into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.A;The coup is successful, and Zhourao embraces the Rising Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.B;The coup is defeated, but Japan is coming…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.T;The Japanese-Zhourao War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.D;Since the inauguration of Japan’s infamously belligerent Emperor, much of Asia has come under the withering gaze of their imperial greed. Up until now, we thought that we were far enough removed from Japan that they would not seriously trouble us. To put it bluntly, we were mistaken. Japan’s mad emperor has declared his intention to conquer all of Zhourao, and a Japanese invasion force is already heading straight for us! Zhourao, forged in the fires of adversity, now faces its greatest battle yet. The Emperor is coming south…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.A;…and it’s fight, work, or perish for Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ameriga_LOT_desc;Ever since the end of European colonialism in eastern Ameriga, power has been split between Amazonia, Lotharingia, and Atlantia. This has allowed foreign mercantile interests to penetrate all of our nations, to say nothing of the strife it has ignited across the continent. Now, however, we have at last come to dominate eastern Ameriga, and our influence pervades Amazonia and Atlantia. Yet we shall not obliterate our rivals – instead, we shall welcome them to join hands with us and stride forwards into a new era. Let the sun rise over a new, united Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The sacrifices that we have made in pursuit of that goal have not always been pleasant or easy, but we have not deviated from our course. At last, the efforts of the Amerigan Society are finally coming to fruition. Our influence across eastern Ameriga has become overwhelming, and the momentum behind our cause can no longer be denied.

The extension of new roads and railways into Gouas have been a particularly welcomed addition, a level of development which the Planteurs’ greed and apathy towards true industrial progress would never have allowed.

AMA_become_ANT_desc;Equinoxia’s successful bid for independence has shattered the Amazonian national identity. As our people awaken to an eastern Ameriga divided even further, the ties which used to bind the eastern and western halves of our nation have been severed, and our sense of cultural place unraveled. There is, however, still a way to survive, and to reforge ourselves. Amazonia had always been dominated by the interests of Antarctica, the eastern region which houses the beating heart of the Planteur establishment. If that is now all that we are, then why should we deny our true nature any longer? We shall be reborn as a new nation, a nation of aristocracy, of order, of tradition, of master and slave.

While Lotharingia would certainly be eager to recapture it, the plight of the Anglo-Lotharians demands that we take action to protect them. Edward shall make one of his cousins the duke of a new Grand Duchy of Odonia, and send him, along with a suitably impressive military contingent, to take control of the wayward state and remake it into a loyal Beornian vassal. They’ll be speaking the King’s English and going to Anglican church in no time. This will, naturally, outrage the Lotharians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

integrate_ODO_desc;With the passage of time, and Beornia now finding itself in a period of peace, the time has come to make the Grand Duchy of Odonia a true part of our blessed kingdom. It is true that the non-Anglo-Saxon inhabitants were initially nonplussed with Beornian rule – poor things, they didn’t understand that we would save both their lives and their souls – but we have finally managed to cement ourselves as the natural sovereigns of the land. True, much of that work was done by our police and military rooting out Lotharian and Odonian nationalists, but that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that today, across Odonia, countless loyal subjects wake up each morning and thank Almighty God for delivering them into Beornia’s benevolent hands.

As new veins of metals, precious or otherwise, are being discovered seemingly every day, the mines are being enlarged and energized by new technologies and industrial tactics. The influx of immigrants keeps labor cheap and plentiful, and the profitability of the mines has corporations flocking to Atlantia.

So far, it has existed in relative isolation, lying beyond the frontiers of any Amerigan nation. However, our explorers have reported that the land would be quite suitable for logging, farming, and ranching, in various locations, and could probably support a substantial population with sufficient infrastructure. As competition grows amongst Amerigan states to secure the continent’s territories, we should act quickly to claim the Chaco for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation declared independence in 1825 among the chaotic events in Europe and Colombia and has maintained relative stability even if there has been friction with Equinoxia and its refusal to compromise with Slave Holders. However, its first action of foreign policy was to seize the region of Atlantia during the Lotharigia Civil War. A action which has not been recognized by anyone in Ameriga and was considered nothing more then a deliberately aggressive act to cement its hold on the continent. If Lotharingia were to stabilize, there may be a final war to decide the fate of Atlantia in the Amazonian Federation and it may be likely that we will fail to keep it. However, if we did win this war then the region would be recognized as our own and Lotharigia will likely be unable to rise against us ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beronia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Thus in 1771 was established the Golden Board, a tripartite commission headed by a Spanish representative to ensure neutrality. The fate of Atlantia was to be negotiated 50 years later but thanks to the instability in the new nation of Lotharingia and the troubles in the still Anglois colony of Equinoxia, Spain was able to renew the mandate for 20 years. Lotharians and Amazonians have however demanded to access the board, a claim refuted by both their former overlords and now both have claimed Atlantia part of their nations. On the other hand, Atlantians clamor for independence from Europe, and as gold mines deplete, the Spanish become more amenable to these demands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

For the Planteur, they are well-dressed, assorted of European wears and passionate of their connection with 'La Patrie' , the care they place into their homes & people is astounding.

The people were almost asymptomatic to the very disgusting fabric of their 'capital'. They lacked any wealth upon their character, and yet they wandered with the smiles of the most indignant and ignorant babes to their world of deserted wealth . And even for their city-livers, they spat and shushed amongst the 'Barons' of the interior, who wore their poverty cloaks of red with pride, like they were the finest Venetian jewellery, and acted like the most prestigious of men in the Estates.

The people of this city are inclined to the mandate moreso to any colonial loyalty. No amazonian or lotharingian exists here, just the atlantians, public debates are common with the students attendance, and yet they are as civilised in discourse as the cities aesthetic.

His work focuses on the creation of the Atlantian people as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1771, with liberty brought by the new international mandate. The cities of Victoire and Nouvelle Amsterdam began to attract new faces to their shores after the initial influx of slaves and workers : artists, who had come to paint or draw the gold-lined estates, Noble sons, with no stake to their father’s inheritance. Writers and educated men, who had wished to enlighten themselves to a new territory of land and knowledge they had not found in their homeland. In just a fair few generations, Nouvelle Amsterdam's streets became as enlightened a place as Anvers or Prague. From this situation was born a new people, who follow first the principle of the liberty of their nation, and all of it's inhabitants to choose as they like;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL8.D;The Gold Mines of Atlantia, a large part of our economy ever since the beginning of the Gold rush that has been ongoing for nearly 70 years, has finally ended. The gold mines have run out, and no new mines have come to replace the old. This will of course have an effect on our economy, however, many also believ this signals an end to Spanish company rule, as the Golden Board exists to only manage gold extraction in Atlantia and perhaps, as hoped by Nationalists, the start of a truly independent Atlantia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This of course puts the political order in Atlantia into question, as for around 70 years now the mandate of the Golden board was, naturally, the gold that was found in Atlantia. Now that this is no longer the case, we will undoubtedly be forced to give up our oversight there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.A;One more reason to let them go;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.T;The Atlantian referendum ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.D;The day has finally come : the Governor of the Golden Board on behalf of the Triple power agreement has organized a vote on the status of Atlantia. The debates lies in two things : first, whether or not Atlantia shall continue to exist but this time as an independent Republic. The second question if independence is not chosen, which country shall Atlantia choose ? Most of the Atlantians have more in common with Lotharingia since the place was originally a Burgundian colony, but the Dictatorship of De Aigle make the Republic of Amazonia a plausible candidate for the citizens to join. Now the ballots are counted and … ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.A;Atlantians have voted for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.B;Atlantians have chosen to rejoin Lotharingia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.C;Atlantians have chosen to rejoin Amazonia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.T;The Republic of Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.D;As hoped by all true Atlantians, our people have voted for an independent Atlantian republic! While the Noblity and peasantry rejoyce, and this is undoubtedly a great day for our fledgling nation, the Amazonians and Lotharingians may not take this news well, as many elements within their governments banked on them winning in the referendum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.A;May we live in unity and freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.T;The Atlantian independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.D;The Results for the Atlantian referendum are in, and they have supposedly voted for Independence. This is a doubtless loss for our nation, as Atlantians are undoubtedly Amazonian in origin, and would be serverd well by our rule. We now have to either accept the results, which would maintain stability in our region and help soothe relations between us and Lotharingia. However, we could declare the results forgeries, and press our rightful claim on Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.A;We accept the results;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.B;It is a forgery !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL14.T;The Atlantian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.D;Atlantia has voted, in a referendum, to declare themselves independent. We were hoping the Atlantians would realise their true nature as a Lotharingian people, however it seems Atlantians and Lotharingians did not see eye to eye. We now have a choice: Either we back down and recognise Atlantian independence, as shameful as that would be, or we declare the results a forgery (Which, according to most of our government, it must be) and press our rightful claim on the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.A;We accept the results;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.B;It is a forgery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL15.T;A new country in Ameriga;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL15.D;Following the referendum to end the Golden Mandate of Spain, Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy over Atlantia, its inhabitants voted to establish a new Republic in the New-World. Many were fearful that either Amazonia or Lotharingia which had staked claims over their territory would contest the results of the vote but thankfully both accepted the results and recognized the new Republic. With this, a new era of prosperity will surely arise in Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL15.A;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL16.T;The Atlantian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL16.D;The region of Atlantia has long been a point of tensions in Ameriga, with both the nations of Amazonia and Lotharingia claiming the rich region as part of their countries. The referendum to abolish the Golden International Mandate ended with a majority of the Atlantians choosing independence. While accepted by Amazonia, this result was seen as a maneuver of the European imperialists and President De Aigle has decided to invade the Republic to reunify the Atlantians with their Lotharian brothers. With Amazonia on the side of the Atlantians, this war will surely change the balance of power on the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL16.A;Gold leads always to war;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL17.T;The Atlantian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL17.D;The region of Atlantia has long been a point of tensions in Ameriga, with both the nations of Amazonia and Lotharingia claiming the rich region as part of their countries. The referendum to abolish the Golden International Mandate ended with a majority of the Atlantians choosing independence. While accepted by Lotharingia, this result was seen as a maneuver of the European imperialists in Amazonia and Amazonian forces are already moving to protect their nationals in Atlantia. With Lotharingia on the side of the Atlantians, this war will surely change the balance of power on the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL17.A;For Atlantia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL18.T;The Great Atlantian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL18.D;The region of Atlantia has long been a point of tensions in Ameriga, with both the nations of Amazonia and Lotharingia claiming the rich region as part of their countries. The referendum to abolish the Golden International Mandate ended with a majority of the Atlantians choosing independence. Neither of her neighbours accepted the results and have declared war on the Republic and each other. Atlantians can only count on themselves and whatever help the Spanish can send them in this era of turnoil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL18.A;For Atlantia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL19.T;The return of the golden province;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL19.D;Our brother-people in Atlantia have rightfully chosen us to inherit their lands! This is little surprise to our government, of course, as Atlantians are clearly a Lotharingian people. But even then, it is assuring to know other see our point of view. Atlantia itself is a rich prize, but the Gold is long gone at this point, although we will of course integrate the land into our nation despite this. Amazonia will not be satisfied with this state of affairs, and many fear we may need to prove our claim on the battlefield, but for now we have won;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL19.A;A great day for Lotharingia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.T;The Atlantians chose Lotharingia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.D;The Atlantians have chosen Lotharingia to rule them! Even though Amazonia is clearly the rightful owner of Atlantia, the people there don't seem to agree with us, likely due to their preposterous notions that slavery is some kind of injustice against mankind. Now, we may humiliate ourselves and accept this state of affairs, or we may march to war, and pull our brothers in Atlantia from the claws of oppressive Lotharingian rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.A;It was a clear forgery! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL20.B;We accept the referendum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL21.T;The Return of the Golden Province;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL21.D;As expected, the Atlantians have chosen to place their trust in Amazonia. The oligarchs rejoice as our economy prepares to be reinvigorated by their rich mines. However, Lotharingia is furious, and is already denouncing the result as fraudulent. This could mean war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL21.A;Whatever their decision, we shall be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.T;The Atlantians chose Amazonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.D;In what was surely the result of extensive Amazonian corruption, bribery, and subterfuge, Atlantia has decided to join Amazonia! They have already taken control of the region, but their hold is not yet so secure that we could not dislodge them by force of arms. Shall we wage war for this jewel of Ameriga?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.A;Yes, to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.B;No, we must face the reality of an Amazonian Atlantia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL230.T;The Fate of Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL230.D;Eventually guns have fallen silent in Ameriga and the claims of our rivals over Atlantia are now relics of the past!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL230.A;Long live $COUNTRY$ !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL231.T;A Meeting in Arariboua Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL231.D;On an island upon the Baie Dorée, a stone’s throw from the former Golden Board headquarters, lies the venerable Arariboua Hall. To outsiders, it is merely a club gathering the elites of Atlantia, but few know the truth about the power that lies within. Home of the Amerigan Society, a masonic-like society that emerged in Atlantia following the establishment of the Mandate, whose members are devoted to their goal of a unified Ameriga based upon liberal principles. Independence was largely gained through their actions, and it was merely the first step of their plan towards the creation of a united Amerigan state. §BAlready, plans are formulated to carve up Amazonia and Lotharingia, to reform their failed constitutions and political systems.§!  §RBy force, if needed.§ ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL231.A;From Port Sucre to Charlemagne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.T;Atlantia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.D;The rich region of Atlantia has ended up in our hands following the referendum and the war. Eventually we have assumed control over the jewel of Ameriga, and already businessmen from Victoire and Nouvelle-Amsterdam have entered our national market. Their influence is important and many in the planteur elites of Antarctica fear that the precarious balance of the nation will be upset by these new interest groups. Atlantians prize Liberty above all, and they are already reaching for the Equinoxians who share much of the same ideals, and criticize the venerable institution of slavery that has allowed us to build a rich and stable nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.A;A poisoned gift ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.T;The Society of the Friends of the Blacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.D;One major club of Atlantia is the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, a philanthropic organization whose aim is the abolition of slavery in Ameriga and the Atlantic at large. It was created in 1804 by the philosopher and journalist Jean-Marie Mercier who dedicated his fortune to the abolitionist cause. The society managed to lobby their Spanish overlord to forbid slave trade in the Golden Mandate, and fought for many years for eventual abolition in Atlantia proper but to no avail because of the use of the African slaves in the gold mines. But as gold mining declined, many former Liberal bourgeois have begun to join the society which publishes the main newspaper of the region : ‘le Libéral’. The importance of this journal is felt throughout the whole country as they publish articles upon articles dealing with the ‘open wound of slavery’ and many Planteurs in the North-East have taken actions to forbid its publishing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.A;Can't they talk about something less controversial ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.T;Frédéric Delgrès in Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.D;Frédéric Delgrès is one of the most prominent and divisive orators of the country. Born a slave to a Black man and a Tupi woman, he served as a secretary for his master’s wife whom had remarked his intellectual capacities and taught him to read. After years of bondage, he managed to escape and continued his education in the free state of Equinoxia. There, he was threatened by his former master who invoked the anti-fugitive laws. Following a lengthy trial, Delgrès was able to buy his liberty thanks to the patronage of the Atlantian Friends. Since then, he has become the main orator of the Abolitionist cause in Amazonia, despite several attempts on his life by the Planteurs. Following the inclusion of Atlantia in the Federation, he toured the place, welcomed in every city by roaring crowds, and meeting several influential individuals in Nouvelle-Amsterdam. His speech in the City Hall has already been published throughout the country and also in Lotharingia by the Libéral papers and is recognized as one of his best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.A;A really amazing character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.T;A Meeting in Port Sucre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.D;Port-Sucre is the capital of the first Antarctican settlements in the North-East and the land has used slave labor since the XVIth century in sugar plantations. That’s where the power of the planter class is the strongest, and where the abolitionist ideals are throwned upon by even the lower classes of white society. Nonetheless, François Barnave, an influential Senator and planteur, often qualified the true power in Antarctica, received a delegation coming straight from Atlantia. The informal meeting discussed the current political crisis related to slavery in the nation. Atlantians understood the economical consequences of abolition and thus pushed forward a plan where a freedom of womb law wiuld allow the gradual abolition while still benefiting the planteurs which would have a lifetime to plan for a society freed of slavery. But the delegation warned : the plan was already criticized in Equinoxia as it was, and should it not pass in the Assembly, the Atlantian Liberals would use ‘every means at their disposal’ to fight planters’ power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.A;A compromise is reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.B;This is Amazonia, not Atlantia, they don't dictate laws here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.T;The Freedom of Womb Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. But eventually the planters from Antarctica were swayed by the new Atlantian politicians who managed to convince them to pursue gradual abolition by letting pass a freedom of womb law. While abolitionnists are discontent everyone recognizes a small step has been taken. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.A;A bright future for Amazonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.T;The Failure of the Abolition Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. At first, it seemed that hope was in sight, as a bill to gradually abolish slavery finally made its way onto the floor of the Amazonian legislature. Liberals across Amazonia were crestfallen and horrified, however, when it was announced that the bill had failed to pass. It appears that the power and influence of the Planteurs was simply too immense for even the most spirited anti-slavery activism to overcome it. As slaveowners raise a toast to their continued domination of the country, the Abolitionnistes begin to plan their next moves, which shall, given the failure of a democratic solution, surely be extreme indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.A;Don't worry about that rabble, my friend! More wine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.T;The Gouas Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.D;Although the Planteurs were wary of the seeming surge in liberal activity in the aftermath of the Abolition Bill’s failure, none but the most paranoid of them had expected this latest turn of events. A coalition of liberals, many of them Atlantians, have congregated in Gouas, a region with growing amounts of abolitionist sentiments, and issued a proclamation which affirms their absolute and unequivocal opposition to slavery and its supporters. However, the document then goes on to declare that, as the Amazonian government “has proven neither able nor willing to uphold the natural rights of its people,” the liberals have declared the “Amazonian regime of bondage and torture” illegitimate and have raised the flag of rebellion! Rallying under a reborn Equinoxia, they seek nothing less than the overthrow of Amazonia and the installation of an abolitionist regime. Officers and regional governors are choosing sides, and war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.A;TRAITORS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.B;Let us strike a blow for freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.T;The Amazonian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.D;The battle lines have been drawn across what was once one Amazonia, and military officers and regional governors have chosen their sides. At stake is the fate of black Amazonians : will they finally achieve freedom or shall they remain clasped in bondage? Thought Atlantia has sought to sway the country towards liberalism, the slaveowners retain entrenched power in the east, and shall resist with all their might any attempts to end Amazonian slavery. Eastern Ameriga plunges once more into the fire, as the Planteurs and Abolitionnistes clash in the war which shall determine the destiny of the nation and perhaps the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.T;Planteur Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.D;Despite the passion of the Equinoxian traitors, and the Atlantian gold which filled their pockets, we have crushed their treasonous insurrection. Some abolitionists have already fled abroad, but many more shall face the prison cell, the gallows, or the firing squad. Black Amazonians find their aspirations obliterated as the Planteurs truly reign supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.A;Back to work, boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.T;Abolitionniste Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.D;At last, at long last, the regime of the Planteurs has been toppled! Though a few notable slaveowners have slipped away into exile, many more shall finally face justice for their crimes against their fellow man. Newly freed black Amazonians rejoice at this triumphant victory over the tyranny of slavery, a beacon of hope to those still enslaved throughout the world. And, of course, nobody can forget the role which the Atlantians played in securing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ATL32.A;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.T;End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.D;Despite their fierce commitments to their ideals, neither Amazonia nor Equinoxia were able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two nations, the Abolitionniste coalition has splintered. Gouas, a mercurial ally at best, saw no reason for further cooperation, and has declared independence. Not only have the Abolitionnistes seemingly accepted this fait accompli, but the sense of dispirit has spread. The Atlantians, having lost faith in Equinoxian leadership, have followed Gouas in declaring independence, hoping to achieve their goals without having to work within another power. The greater Equinoxia which the Abolitionnistes erected lies shattered, reduced to its core territories as the coalition falls into infighting. Though Amazonia is much reduced, perhaps the Planteurs have had the last laugh after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.A;Mon dieu, mon dieu, pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.T;The Unstable Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.D;Amazonia is a nation of far greater diversity that it first appears to possess. While the Planteurs might dominate politics and business, their primacy is not universally accepted. The Argentins of Gouas, a Planteur bastion, are loathed by other parts of the nation for their notoriously flamboyant and autocratic governor, who has turned much of the region into his fief. Meanwhile, the liberal Equinoxians challenge the slaveocracy and champion the ideals forged in the fires of the Great German Wars and the revolutions which preceded them. While the government has previously been able to prevent discord amongst its provinces, the situation seems to now be growing serious. As the regional differences of Amazonia continue to cause political flareups, some whisper of violence, of secession, of civil war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.A;Why are they getting so troublesome all of a sudden?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.T;Helping Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.D;The Amazonian Federation seems to be entering a period of unrest. Gouas and Equinoxia are both beginning to challenge the government’s authority, albeit for vastly different reasons, putting strain on the federal balance of power. This situation presents an excellent opportunity to break the Planteur slaveowners’ stranglehold on the country, using our influence among the various politicians and groups of Amazonia. We may watch safely from a distance as the old order comes crashing down, and if we are successful, a better society, one of equity, equality, and justice, shall replace it. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Amazonia push for greater autonomy – the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Victoire to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.A;We are here to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.T;The Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.D;The situation in Gouas and Equinoxia is reaching a breaking point. Both states have begun to resist efforts by the federal government to rein them in or even to collect taxes in their states, the former because of its well-connected and despotic governor and the latter because of its liberal opposition to slavery. Reports that they have begun organizing independent militias, however, has caused sufficient alarm as to compel moderates to seek a negotiated solution. Into this crisis has stepped Atlantia, who has convened a meeting in Victoire to discuss the issue. What they have proposed shocked our representatives : the granting of high levels of autonomy to Gouas and Equinoxia, effectively making them internally sovereign states, though we would control their foreign affairs. Many Planteurs are outraged at this plan but a few have admitted that it may be the only way to prevent this situation from spiraling into war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.A;If that is what is needed to preserve peace, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.B;Ridiculous! Leave the meeting at once, we won't stand for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.T;The Victoire Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were successful. Gouas and Equinoxia have now become nearly sovereign, but for the Amazonian overseers which remain to control their foreign affairs. Civil war has been prevented, but Amazonia is now considerably weaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.A;Peace in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.T;Failure of the Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were unsuccessful. The Amazonians were suspicious of us even before the meeting began, but when our representative explained the proposal for Antarctican and Equinoxian autonomy, the Amazonians flew into a rage. Denouncing us as “a conclave of vultures and coyotes” and “a den of scavengers,” they left the conference with haste, and the crestfallen Argentin and Equinoxian delegates soon followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.T;The Conseil Seizes Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.D;The continued machinations of Atlantia, Equinoxia, and Gouas, coupled with the federal government’s apparent inability to respond, has pushed the military into taking action. A cabal of generals and admirals, proclaiming themselves to be the “defenders of the rule of law,” have seized control of the government and “persuaded” the previous civilian authorities to appoint the conspirators to a military conseil to govern the nation instead. This news has been received particularly badly in Equinoxia, where phrases like “ravishing of democracy” and “illegitimate takeover” have been bandied about. Perhaps it is well that the military is in control, since now we shall probably have need of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.A;For order and stability!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.T;Rumblings From Equinoxia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.D;It is no secret that Equinoxia has been the center of dissent since the conseil took power, much to the aggravation of our righteous leaders. While we have always known of their tendency towards troublemaking, they are now embracing much more dangerous pursuits. It seems that earlier reports about Equinoxian militias were true, as several policemen have discovered evidence of them drilling in the countryside. What’s more, officers in Equinoxia have reported meetings of notable Equinoxians under cover of darkness, in basements or on farms – meetings where firebrands preach the doctrine of secession. The conseil has, understandably, not taken this well, and has ordered all such meetings broken up and anybody found to be attending them arrested. While our security personnel assure us that this will break the back of any anti-Amazonian conspiracies, no matter how many meetings we disrupt, they seem to be growing more frequent and numerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.A;Just keep it out of the papers, it'll all blow over soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.T;The Equinoxian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.D;It seems that our raids on Equinoxian secessionist meetings and our attempts to track down the militias were for naught. This morning, a proclamation was issued signed by regional officials from across Equinoxia, denouncing the federal government as “the clawed hand of slaveocracy” and “the bludgeon of the Planteurs,” and repudiating their allegiance to the conseil. The Equinoxians, “desiring an equal, equitable, and just government, which rules by the consent of the governed and allows all men, regardless of color, to give or retract that consent to their representatives,” have dissolved all ties with the federal government. This document is nothing less than articles of secession! Already Equinoxian military officers have rapidly defected to this rebellion, which now stands poised to fight. The Amazonian Civil War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.A;Crush the revolters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.T;The Gouas Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.D;Our spies in Amazonia have confirmed that tensions at their highest between the Antarcticans and the Equinoxians. At any moment, war could erupt between the two regions. While a tragedy, it also gives us an opportunity. The region of Gouas is rich in lands and possibilities of industry and slavery doesn't hold as much power as it does in the North of Antarctica. Moreover the governor of the place is a greedy man that is thankfully full of debts. We could arrange a small bribe to him to consider an 'independence fight', under our protection of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.A;Contact our men in Gouas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.B;We are better than this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.T;The Secession of Gouas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.D;As if the secession of Equinoxia wasn’t bad enough, now Gouas has also declared independence! Their governor has spouted various platitudes on “regional liberty” and “resisting federal tyranny,” but we suspect a different motive to at play. While he has acted rather defiant in the past, he is known to have expensive tastes and vast debts – and, recently, to have been in contact with Atlantian businessmen. Our domestic spies have confirmed that Goaus has gotten very friendly with Atlantia recently, and all evidence points to this being nothing less than a plot to backstab us in our moment of weakness! We shall not forget this Atlantian intrigue, but how should we deal with the problem in the short term?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.A;We shall crush Gouas as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.B;We must focus on Equinoxia for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.D;The dust has settled upon Amazonia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon eastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Amazonia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.T;Atlantia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.D;Despite the intrigues of Amazonia, the Atlantians have seen the light and integrated into our nation. However, while this shall surely be a tremendous boon for our economy, some speak with concern about the political ideas such a liberal city might introduce into our nation. Atlantia is known for radicalism, which is the last thing that a stable and secure republic like Lotharingia needs. Nevertheless, as our treasury begins to swell with the taxes and tariffs we reap from Atlantia’s mines and trade, few are in much position to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.A;I'm sure that it won't be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.T;Plotters in Ariraboua;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.D;It seems that de Aigle’s fears towards Atlantia were not misplaced after all. His vast network of spies, informants, and other agents have already begun to bring word of liberal schemes emanating from Nouvelle Amsterdam. Rumors abound of plans by reformers and radical republicans to bring serious political change to Lotharingia and point to one place : the notorious Ariraboua club which most Atlantian politicians, journalists and officers frequent. de Aigle knows that this means that treason is afoot, and that the liberals are planning nothing less than his removal from power and the toppling of his regime. Perhaps they even seek to have him go the way of Caesar…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.A;Traitors! I'm surrounded by traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.T;Choice of the Chef;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.D;Over the years, the political actions of de Aigle have varied but for one thing : the independence and unity of Lotharingia. All his actions have always been in the interest of the new nation that was born out of the oppression of Burgundy. But as Atlantian interests take over a large part of the national economy and their Liberal views create instability, the 'chef' wonders. His Presidency-for-life of the Republic only arose because of the Civil War against the traitors that wanted to tie Lotharingia with Europe once again : they had used democracy to weaken the country after all. Over the years, in his discussions with Edward of Beornia he nonetheless expressed that ruling would be easier as King, and the idea of royalty has often been used both to support his actions or tarnish his reputation. But at the same time, with Lotharingia reunified with Atlantia and proved strong and resilient, perhaps it is time to let democracy flourish once again in the country and bring back the ideals of the Lotharian Founding Fathers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.A;A monarchy fits the national character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.B;This has worked for years, why change it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.C;Call new elections, it is time to rebuild democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.T;The Free Elections of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.D;Lotharingia has seen harsh times since its independence. de Aigle, ‘le Libérateur’ had seized power following the election of the ‘New-Alsatians’ party (named that way because most of its leaders came from the north of the country) and had cemented his rule for decades. But following the reunification of Atlantia with the rest of the country, Liberals had regained power and many feared a new Civil War was on its way. The announcement of new elections and the resignation of de Aigle was thus seen as a surprise to many. But as the new president Roger de Lisle, an Atlantian born politician, takes office, de Aigle has formally granted him his former function and welcomed him with a speech that was widely distributed throughout the country. It seems that a new democratic regime has been born today in the New World. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.A;Vive le Libérateur, sauveur de la démocratie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.T;The Plan of Saxi-Bourdon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.D;The rats’ burrows of treason reached far deeper than even de Aigle expected. It is now clear that the introduction of Atlantia into Lotharingia fatally undermined the political consensus which de Aigle had cultivated since the inauguration of his rule. Their innovative ideology and radical ways seeped into the national fabric, turning moderates into liberals, liberals into radicals, radicals into revolutionaries. And that is, today, what has broken out : a revolution, against de Aigle and the autocratic rule which he stands for. The treasonous liberals have assembled in New Alsace, long a center of emerging liberal thought, and have denounced de Aigle’s rule as “the rampant despotism of a grasping tyrant!” Atlantia and New Alsace have joined forces in preparation to overthrow le Chef, outlining their justifications for ousting him and their intentions to create a liberal, democratic republic in their “Plan of Saxi-Bourdon.” All of Lotharingia shall soon be ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.A;May there be a Hell for you, Atlantians - a Tartarus, bleak and unending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.B;De Aigle's reign must end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.D;Chef de Aigle’s one-man rule of Lotharingia has finally pushed his enemies to the breaking point. The influx of Atlantian wealth and ideas has given liberals the resources they needed to finally mount a challenge to his control of the republic, rallying all those who oppose him, whether for reasons of ideology or out of personal vengeance. The New Alsatians and Atlantians have castigated de Aigle and everything that he stands for, decrying him as brute, a dictator, a Caesar, “whose endless pursuit of power has brought calamity to the people and toxicity to the national soul.” Lotharingia has now been ripped in half between those who stand by de Aigle and abhor the dawn of liberalism, and those who hail Atlantia’s dreams of liberty as the future of the nation. All of Ameriga watches as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance, caught between Lotharingia and New Alsace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.T;Victory of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.D;It seems that all of the money in the world could not allow the Atlantians or the New Alsatians to obtain victory. de Aigle has shattered the liberal insurrection, and his total domination of Lotharingia is now unquestioned. As his troops sweep across towns and cities throughout the north, all enemies of the regime are being seized for questioning, trial, and punishment. Though the torch of liberty seems to have been extinguished in Lotharingia, Le Chef is unworried : the destiny of a proud nation – HIS nation – awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.A;Vive le Chef!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.T;Northerners' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.D;Le Chef is no more! De Aigle’s rule of Lotharingia has finally been ended, broken by the might of New Alsace and the guile of Atlantia. The former dictator was found dead in his office, pistol clutched in his hand. While he may have escaped true justice, many more of his accomplices and lower-ranking followers shall face trial for the injuries they inflicted upon the republic. A new day dawns over Lotharingia : one of democracy, of the people, by the people, and for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.A;Sic semper tyrannus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.T;The Atlantian Takeover;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.D;To the bewilderment of all of Ameriga, neither de Aigle’s Lotharingia nor the liberals’ New Alsace were able to achieve a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two states, it appears that the Atlantians have decided to take matters into their own hands. The New Alsatian government has been forcibly deposed by a private army of Atlantian mercenaries, and Atlantia has assumed direct control of what used to be northern Lotharingia. Though the new Atlantian regime promises to continue to protect democracy, the fact that its rebirth was tainted by the original sin of New Alsace’s overthrow shall haunt the republic forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.A;If you want something done right, you must do it yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.T;De Aigle Criticized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.D;A few years ago, criticism of Chef de Aigle would’ve been unthinkable. With his vast network of agents strewn throughout the country, nobody would’ve dared say anything seriously damaging about him, not to anyone except those that they absolutely trusted. Yet recently, a strange mood has come over Lotharingia : that of dissent. In meeting houses and in taverns, in marketplaces and in alleyways, de Aigle and his government have begun to be questioned with unprecedented intensity. More and more people are beginning to take issue with his rule : with his suppression of democracy, with his management of the economy, with his control of the media, with his ban on public meetings…The list goes on, a litany of complaints against his dictatorship, and though our brave police try to squash what they can, the whispers keep coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.A;Be silent! I command it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.T;A Plan for Peace in Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.D;It appears that Chef de Aigle’s grip on Lotharingia is finally beginning to weaken. Criticism of his rule has begun to grow to unprecedented levels, as our agents within the country have reported. This is an excellent opportunity to fuel such discontent, and fan the flames of popular anger towards him until his regime finally collapses. After that, why, it would only be the humane thing to do to protect whatever emerged from the destruction of the dictatorship. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Lotharingia push for greater autonomy – the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Varennes to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.A;This is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.T;The Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.D;De Aigle was merely concerned when he heard that more and more people were beginning to repudiate the regime. When he heard that the governors of New Alsace and Odonia had begun to speak out against him, however, he grew furious. Yet both governors maintain control of a local militia, as is standard for internal peacekeeping, and lately they seem to have received outside help in outfitting it to be more akin to a true army. With the sudden threat of civil war, the Atlantians have stepped into the picture, offering to hold a conference in Varennes to discuss a diplomatic solution. What they proposed to de Aigle, however, shocked him : the full autonomy of New Alsace and Odonia, with le Chef allowed to dictate their foreign policy but with their respective governors in full control of their domestic policies. Both men seem to be recent converts to Atlantian liberalism, yet this could relieve the burden on de Aigle’s government and allow them to focus more on suppressing dissent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.A;What has become of me? Oh, very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.B;Ridiculous! I still have my pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.T;The Varennes Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.D;Though Chef de Aigle was bitter about the decision, he finally decided to relent and accept our proposal for the federalization of Lotharingia. While this will probably allow him to more efficiently crack down on liberalism within his remaining directly-ruled lands, New Alsace and Odonia both seem set to become islands of liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.A;A blow to his regime nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL58.T;Failure of the Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.D;Chef de Aigle was hostile to us from the moment that he heard that Atlantia sought to get involved in Lotharian affairs. When he heard our proposal for federalization, he grew utterly outraged. Denouncing us as “loathesome butchers” and “a gang of unwashed thieves,” he quickly departed from Varennes, hurling invectives as he left. It seems that Lotharian federalization is dead in the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL59.T;Plotters Everywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.D;The aftermath of the Varennes Convention has seen Lotharingia dive further into instability. New Alsace has begun to protest de Aigle’s management of the economy, arguing that free trade would benefit the country reap greater rewards in the long run – they probably also have an eye to their domestic markets. Meanwhile, de Aigle’s continued tendency to promote friends and other members of the “old guard” to positions within the military is causing younger officers to chafe, upset that they have been passed over. Furthermore, many young officers frequently find their salaries skimmed, meaning that not only are they denied the promotions with larger salaries, but the money they do receive is even less than it ought to be. As if this weren’t enough, reports are coming in that the Guarani tribes to the west are beginning to launch probing attacks into villages, or accosting officials who enter their territory. If someone were to unite them, they might prove a force to be reckoned with. Lotharingia is slowly descending into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.A;Everything is under control! I swear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL60.T;Our contacts in Nouvelle-Alsace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.D;We have made contact with several New Alsatian nationalists, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the Lotharian regime, with particular emphasis on their distaste for de Aigle. If we were to support them in an uprising against Lotharingia, we might be able to gain enough leverage to forc – to persuade them to join our nation instead, with considerable autonomy of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.A;We shall try our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL61.T;The New-Alsatian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.D;Over the past few years, New Alsace has become quite dissatisfied with de Aigle. The region has accused him of stifling economic growth due to his protectionist policies, along with exploiting local businesses to fill his coffers and generally neglecting local needs. This was seen as mere grumbling, but de Aigle’s informants have reported that several outspoken New Alsatian nationalists have been meeting with notable Atlantian politicians and businessmen. This conspiracy has now burst forth into open rebellion, as New Alsace declares independence with Lotharingia! Atlantia has rushed to support them, proclaiming their solidarity with the New Alsatian traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.A;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL62.T;The Jeune Lotharians' Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.D;The New Alsatian secession has finally destroyed de Aigle’s credibility with many military officers. Their careers sabotaged by corruption, thoroughly disgusted at de Aigle’s unilateral refusal to ever compromise, and with plenty of ambition, the Ligue de Jeunes officers Lotharien or simply the Jeune Lotharians has finally made its move. As de Aigle was finishing breakfast in his presidential palace, a team of mutineers infiltrated through the servants' entrance, then fought their way through the building. De Aigle barely had time to flee, leaping out of the window and into a nearby tree before commandeering a stagecoach and departing the capital just before the Jeune Lotharians were able to seal it off. Much of the country is now under the Jeune Lotharians’ control, and they have promised to restore stability to the nation. However, not everyone has defected to the rebels - de Aigle still has powerful friends in Odonia, the southern state where he was born, and where he has now fled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.A;Viva les Jeunes Lotharians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.T;The Secession of Odonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.D;It was obvious that de Aigle would take action against the Jeune Lotharians as soon as he was able. Having arrived in Odonia, he contacted regional politicians, businessmen, and military officials across the area, and rapidly gained their allegiance. All of Odonia has now broken away, as de Aigle declares a state of insurrection in Lotharingia and New Alsace and prepares to use what limited resources he has to attempt to reconquer both. It is also believed that de Aigle may attempt to call in help from a third party : the Beornians, whose ruler, King Edward, has long been an acquaintance of de Aigle. Yet the presence of Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia and de Aigle’s position of weakness may make such a gamble even riskier than le Chef believes. Whatever the case, the country has now fractured even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.A;He can run, but he can't hide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.B;Vive le Chef! Vive Odonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.T;An Appeal to Beornia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.D;The Beornians under King Edward have become the closest thing a man as paranoid as de Aigle has to an ally. Admiring their stability under the monarchy and the unified sense of allegiance which they hold towards their sovereign, de Aigle and King Edward have found some common ground over the years, even if they wouldn’t consider themselves close friends. This gives us an opportunity to obtain aid from Beornia against the New Alsatians and the Lotharian nationalists. However, it is a dangerous request to make towards Beornia. There is a reason that de Aigle has never allowed himself to grow too close to King Edward : the presence of Anglo-Lotharians, Lotharians of Beornian descent, in Odonia and other border regions. Beornian nationalists have long advanced territorial claims against Lotharingia on these grounds, and it is not out of the question that King Edward might seek concessions from de Aigle in return for his services. Yet in this desperate hour, what choice do we have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.A;It is a risk that we must take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL64.B;Le Chef has been backstabbed enough, forget it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.T;Edward's Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.D;The blunders of Chef de Aigle, dictator of Lotharingia, have finally exploded in his face, as New Alsace secedes with Atlantian aid, Lotharingia proper falls to a military clique, and Odonia becomes le Chef’s last refuge. As he prepares to attempt destroy both the liberals and the nationalists, he has appealed to King Edward on the grounds of their mutual friendship and political interests to aid him, arguin that a victory by either rebel faction would be disastrous for both Lotharingia and for Beornia. After receiving this news, the King’s advisors have weighed in on the matter. Many argue that we should at least demand the western part of Odonia in return for aid, as it has a sizable Anglo-Lotharian minority. Jingoists declare that, as de Aigle has proven himself incapable, we should engineer a coup in Odonia and seize control of the whole region. Some urge Edward not to get involved at all, claiming that Beornia should not drain its resources fighting in a foreign war. What is the will of the King?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.A;We demand Transfleuve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL65.B;Contact the Anglo-Lotharians, de Aigle is not needed anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.C;We can't take a side against the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.T;Promising Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.D;King Edward has agreed to help us, on one condition : the transfer of Transfleuve, a region with an Anglo-Lotharian minority, to Beornia. We are not in a position to refuse, and so le Chef has reluctantly conceded to this demand in order to secure Beornia’s aid. After all, De Aigle tells himself, just because he agrees now doesn’t mean that he must follow through...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.A;A small price to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL67.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigle’s private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigle’s despotism. Le Chef himself has fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians. Like the Romans of old, de Aigle’s bid for imperium has given rise to those who would see him cast down. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL68.T;The Assassination of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.D;De Aigle was relieved when a column of Beornian troops, escorted by Anglo-Lotharian volunteers, approached his field headquarters – presumably to place themselves under his command, or at least to confirm their new alliance. It was therefore an utter shock when they opened fire, decimating the Odonian loyalists! De Aigle, with no time to flee, was cut down where he stood by a volley of rifle shots, and many of his supporters were killed as well, with the survivors arrested to prevent them from spreading news of de Aigle’s assassination. As Beornian troops and their collaborators fan out across Odonia, Anglo-Lotharians have been foisted into positions of power throughout the region. The head of the Beornian contingent has proclaimed a new government , the Grand Duchy of Odonia, and declared it to be a Beornian vassal. This intrigue has not halted the grinding turn of the gears of war, but it has most certainly astonished all involved, save the loyal subjects of His Majesty the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.A;Long live Royal Odonia and God Save the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL69.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigle’s private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigle’s despotism. Le Chef himself fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians, but King Edward of Beornia had other plans. Working with Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia, the Beornians assassinated de Aigle and took control of the region for themselves. Like the Romans of old, de Aigle’s bid for imperium attracted both domestic rivals and foreign intruders, and the nation that he built is now under siege from within and without. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL70.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.D;The dust has settled upon Lotharingia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon southeastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Lotharingia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL71.T;The Aváni Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.D;The Guarani peoples of the western interior have been getting restless lately, but since they were largely divided into different tribes without much coordination or leadership, they did not pose a serious threat. The situation has now changed. Nheçu Tumpa, a Guarani chieftain and shaman, has unified the tribes after both a string of victories against Lotharian patrols and a series of messianic visions in which he proclaims that Nhanderuvuçu, supreme god of the Guarani and the Tupi peoples, has entrusted him with liberating the Guarani. Nheçu has thus proclaimed the realm of Avá, and has declared that, while he shall allow democracy and henceforth retain only religious duties, anyone of European descent who trespasses into Avá shall be struck down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.A;What madness is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.T;Ceding Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, we must cede Transfleuve to Beornia in reward for their assistance. But, “must” – is that not a strong word to use? Who says that de Aigle “must” do anything? By what right do they seek to compel le Chef to submit to them? Perhaps we could refuse. Perhaps we could fight them, and beat them, too! Perhaps…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.A;...no, there's been enough bloodshed. Cede it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.B;It is time to alter the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.T;Lotharingia Cedes Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, Lotharingia must cede Transfleuve to us in reward for our service. They have complied, and our administration has already taken possession of the territory. Though it might be a bit troublesome to integrate, we shall make the effort, for God, for King, and for Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.A;Hail Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.T;Lotharingia Refuses to Cede Transfleuve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.D;We had suspected that Chef de Aigle, power-mad as he is, might seek to betray our agreement which brought him the aid in the Lotharian Civil War that de Aigle so desperately needed. This has now come to pass, with de Aigle angrily denouncing our “attempts to dismember Lotharingia so soon after our struggle.” Unfortunately for him, we have his signature on the treaty by which he promised to cede Transfleuve to us, and we have wasted no time in publishing it. The whole text is now being read in newspapers from here to Copenhagen, and de Aigle has been revealed as a duplicitous oath breaker. In the eyes of the international community, Lotharingia’s claims to Transfleuve are forfeit, whereas ours are now indisputable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.A;Did he truly believe that he could get away with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.T;The Burgundian Royal Family;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.D;Few could imagine such a fate for the royals of Burgundy : a Republic has been established in Anvers, leaving them without a throne to sit on and exiled by the decree of those now in power. While many thought to stay in Europe among their allies, Prince Jean has decided to settle in Lotharingia, the country he felt the most kinship with. He was welcomed in Fort Lothère by De Aigle in person as both were happy to remind the world of the shared legacy of Burgundy in the western hemisphere. Already he and his family have settled in a villa near Douancy, having pledged to not influence politics but live a socialite life on the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.A;How far they have fallen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.T;The Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.D;The affairs of our former overlord have been the first subject of conversation in Lotharingia for months. The clash between the Burgundian Royalists and the Parliamentarians have been heavily documented, both in the press and in the cafés, while emigrants fleeing the Civil War arrive at our shores in search of a new life in Ameriga. The success of the Parliamentarians and the exile of King Jean have been celebrated by many, especially the Atlantians. But yesterday, a dashing figure has appeared in the port of Fort Lothère. Prince Jean the Younger, son of Burgundy’s former autocrat, has fled to our shore as a simple citizen searching for a new life following the demise of his father. None know his intent, but he has been welcomed by exiled Burgundian conservatives and the Board of Immigration has seen no problem with his bid for citizenship;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.A;Even royals want to live in the New World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.T;Jean Enlists in the Lotharingian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.D;Prince Jean, or simply Jean Bouillon as he prefers, has joined the ranks of the Lotharingian army yesterday, to the general apathy of the country which simply does not care much for the fate of an exiled Burgundian prince. Nonetheless, Jean Comte, journalist for the Temps d’Amérigue, has covered the incorporation of the royal veteran in the army. Prince Jean did indeed fight in the Civil War, although Liberals argue it was only as a colonel in a tranquil countryside, and the Lotharingian generals were happy to get some noble blood in charge of one of their regiments. When asked why he decided to enlist for a country that his forefathers fought, he was quoted saying that he ‘came from a bloodline of warriors, and only iron and blood’ could make him ‘worthy of their legacy,’ whether or not it was under the Burgundian flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.A;In Fort Lothère you can be a new man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.T;The Battle of Rivière du Sang;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.D;Yesterday, a contingent of 50 men patrolling a remote river in Guarani territory was assailed by a tribe who had resisted previous Lotharingian visits and encroachment upon their territory. The battle began badly, as the rear guard was assaulted and split from the rest of the force. However, Prince Jean Bouillon, leader of the expedition, saved his fellow soldiers and forced the tribe to retreat before burning their village and planting the Lotharingian flag upon its ashes. This story has made the dashing young prince a national hero, notably thanks to the report of his friend the journalist Jean Comte.\n\n Several experts on the Guaranis have expressed their doubts at the whole story, for this tribe had not posed any problems before the arrival of the Prince, but with no survivors it seems the official story is the only story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.A;Who doesn’t love the story of valiant young princes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.T;Jean ‘the Brave‘;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.D;The renown of Jean Bouillon has only grown following his success in Guarani territory. Appointed as advisor to the Minister of War, he has gained a post in the capital and has begun to oversee vast reforms, such as mandating mess halls for barracks and implementing more egalitarian conscription policies by forcing priests and young bourgeois students to serve in the national army. Many soldiers and nationalists have taken to singing ‘Notre Prince d’Amérigue’, a popular song that was written following his exploit on the Blood River, and his portrait is often seen adorning the interior of military cafés and bars. Most importantly, it is said that Jean Bouillon was admitted in the Ariraboua Club, securing his relation with Atlantian elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.A;A brilliant career awaits him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.T;The Medals Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.D;The highest order of merit in Lotharingia is the Libérateur De Aigle medal, awarded to those deemed worthy of recognition for great military deeds in service of the Republic of Lotharingia. The Order has been awarded with increasing frequency over the years, but few questioned this, simply assuming that more Lotharingians were serving their country with the highest zeal. But yesterday, the front page of Le Temps d’Amérigue broke the news of a national scandal, as Lotharingian President Mathieu Schoelcher was revealed to be selling the medals for his own personal gain! The Ministry of War documents published in the article were confirmed as genuine by the National Assembly and many have called for the President to resign and face trial. Faced with no other option, Schoelcher resigned today, calling for new elections to be organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.A;A shocking affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.T;Bouillon’s Candidacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.D;It came as a surprise to no one when Jean Bouillon declared his candidacy for President of Lotharingia. Running as an independent and having built up a sizable amount of support with the lower class and the army, he also has friends in the press and industrial milieux. Moreover, his fellow members of the clandestine Amerigan Society have approved of his candidacy, as they admire his bellicose approach to unification of the Southern continent and he has made no secret over the years of his support for Liberal ideas. With the political scene empty following the resignation of the once popular Schoelcher and the scandal’s tainting of his party colleagues, it seems he will have no problem securing the Presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.A;President and Prince?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.T;From volunteers to soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.D;The Golden Board of Atlantia hardly maintained a force because of its neutrality. But in the 1820's, with the independence of Lotharingia and Amazonia, the Gobernador Luis de Laserna decided to authorize the creation of volunteer forces and bought artillery from Spain to protect the cities from any threat. These Volunteer forces were soon organized by a newly arrived German baron, Jonathan Zweibrücken, who renamed himself Deuxponts, into a Volunteer army. With the independence, Jonathan was given command of all forces and helped secure Atlantian independence. His reforms have transformed the militias of old into the mightiest force of the continent and he has been chosen to be the first recipidient of the Order of the Atlantian Cock, the highest decoration of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.A;Everyone give it up for Amerigan favorite fighting German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.T;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.D;The election has seen Jean Bouillon, the former heir to the Burgundian throne and now a national hero of Lotharingia, dominate the electoral scene. No candidate could secure a network as powerful as his among the men of money and industry, nor match his fame with the lower classes. His platform of anti-corruption and Pan-Ameriganism is seen as a populist one, and despite his famous reputation, many accuse him of being a glory hound without any real plan or vision. Nonetheless, as the results are called it seems that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.A;Jean Bouillon is the new President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.B;Another candidate managed to secure the Presidency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.T;An Ultimatum to the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.D;Jean Bouillon ran his campaign on a general Pan-Ameriganism platform and has worked to secure the domination of Lotharingia over the whole continent. Amazonia has been a particular target for nationalists over the years as Atlantians argued that the reorganized Lotharingia had a moral duty to reorganize the North and shatter the planters’ power. President Jean has agreed that Amazonia’s condition can no longer be tolerated and has decided to issue an ultimatum to them : lay down their arms and integrate into a Federation with Atlantians and Lotharingians, or face the wrath of the Southern armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.A;We await their response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.T;An Ultimatum from Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.D;Jean Bouillon, once heir to the Burgundian throne and now a famous exile in Lotharingia, has rapidly gathered public support to the point of winning the Lotharian presidential election. He campaigned on a platform of pan-Ameriganism, and he has now put his beliefs into practice – by force. We have received a demand from President Bouillon, demanding that we lay down our arms and enter a new “Amerigan Federation” along with Atlantia and Lotharingia, or face invasion! Many ministers are astonished, bewildered, or outraged, and the whole executive branch has been thrown into chaos. A few optimistic cabinet members declared it to be a hoax, only for border guards to report Lotharian troops massing nearby. The news shall surely go public at any moment, either from our own disclosure or from the first Lotharian assault. We must decide how to react and we must decide now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.A;They want our arms? Come and take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.B;Well, gentlemen, here's to Ameriga...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.D;The response from Amazonia was curt and simple : “If you want our arms, come and take them.” It seems that one last war must be fought for the fate of Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.T;They Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.D;Success! Amazonia recognized that they could not hope to resist us, and bowed before our might. Without firing a shot, President Jean Bouillon has secured the entirety of Amazonia. Pan-Ameriganists rejoice across the nation, and Nouvelle Amsterdam in particular rings out with joyous praise of the President as Bouillon turns to his next order of business : preparing the announcement of Amerigan unification. Yet, even after all of the wild and fantastic turns of his life, he has one last surprise planned for the Amerigan people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.A;And now, a tour of the nation - and then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.T;Jean I, Emperor of the Amerigans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.D;"For the past week, I have toured our great nation, and seen its verdant jungles, great mountains, vast plains, thriving cities, and all who live there. I have done this so that I may know the condition of the land, and the needs of its people. This has been accomplished, but far more importantly, it has impressed upon me the anxiety of the nation. Never have a people testified with such earnestness, passion, and clarity, as those I have encountered who have expressed a unanimous need for security of leadership. Ameriga today encompasses me with her sympathies because I am not a mere dreamer. I have, through the energies of my labor and those who have labored together with me, brought forth the unification of our people. Do not mistake me for an autocrat, for I am first a shepherd. In order to benefit the country, it is necessary not to wield the mailed fist, but rather to bear the torch of inspiration to light the way for its people. It is for all these reasons that I stand before this nation today as its first Emperor.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.A;And so an empire is born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL94.T;Statue of Dom Joao de Tupac Unveiled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL94.D;Director Dom Joao de Tupac, father of Sapa Inca Pachacuti II (formerly known Duke Tupac, ruler of Cisandina), was the Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia from 1810 to 1820. During this time, he expanded mining industries, supported increasing European immigration in the wake of the Great German Wars, and worked to prevent Spain or any other European power from keeping Atlantia a mere colony. As a result, while he had retired before the advent of the Atlantian Republic, he is well-regarded for his role in ensuring its independence and prosperity. This morning a statue of Dom Joao was officially unveiled in a public park near the old director’s office (now the presidential manor), within sight of the Inca Empire embassy. While this gesture will no doubt increase our ties with the Inca, we could use it as an opportunity to propose a full-fledged military alliance in the name of Amerigan security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL94.A;Let our nations march together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL94.B;No, we desire only to honor our shared past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL95.T;Diplomatic Overtures from Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL95.D;Rumors have been swirling amongst our diplomats in Atlantia that a major political effort was about to be launched to court our favor. Now a statue of Dom Joao de Tupac, Pachacuti II’s father and former Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia, has been unveiled near our embassy! While Dom Joao played a notable role in laying the groundwork for Atlantia’s eventual independence, observers believe that the statue also symbolizes Atlantia’s commitment to good relations with us. Therefore, few Inca ministers were surprised when Atlantia proposed a military alliance between our nations. Atlantian politicians were sharply critical of the previous dynasty but now they appear to have changed their tune and are seeking rapprochement with their western neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL95.A;We accept the alliance, for the good of Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL95.B;Once a pan-nationalist, always a pan-nationalist. We cannot trust them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL96.T;The Inca Empire Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL96.D;Pachacuti II and his ministers were pleased by our gestures of friendship. They have concluded a treaty of diplomatic cooperation with us, which includes a military alliance among other terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL96.A;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL97.T;The Inca Empire Declines;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL97.D;Despite our gestures of friendship, Pachacuti II demurred from a firm security commitment between our nations. While they expressed their gratitude, it seems that there are too many lingering issues between us for the Inca Empire to embrace an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL97.A;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL98.T;Atlantia Unveils Statue of Dom Joao de Tupac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL98.D;A statue of Dom Joao de Tupac, Pachacuti II’s father and former Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia, has been unveiled near our embassy in Nouvelle Amsterdam! Dom Joao is a notable figure in colonial Atlantian history, having played a notable role in laying the groundwork for Atlantia’s eventual independence. Some of our ministers had expected that this would mark the opening of a diplomatic campaign by the Atlantians towards us, but this seems to have been incorrect. While the Atlantians have expressed their friendship with our nation they have also made it clear that it was not intended as a direct statement of foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL98.A;A tremendous gesture all the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL99.T;Diplomatic Overtures from Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL99.D;No other nation in Ameriga has been as supportive of us as Atlantia. From the day that the Romanticos came to power, we have enjoyed a particular relationship with Nouvelle-Amsterdam which transcends ordinary politics, united in our opposition to European imperialism and to the tyranny of despotisms like Tawantinsuyu and Beornia. Now Atlantia’s diplomats have come forward to propose an official military alliance between our nations, citing our shared commitment to an Ameriga free of autocracy. While the advantages of such an arrangement are obvious, Atlantia’s pan-nationalism alarms many of our more security-minded ministers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL99.A;We must stand together to safeguard the continent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL99.B;No, we cannot trust such megalomaniacs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL100.T;Quito Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL100.D;The Romanticos, eager to defend Ameriga against autocracy, have agreed to form a military alliance. Together we will safeguard the continent and all of its peoples!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL100.A;Huzzah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL101.T;Quito Declines;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL101.D;The Romanticos have decided not to form an alliance with our nation. While they sympathize with and support our goals, they made it clear that they found our pan-nationalist rhetoric to be a subject of concern, and a potentially destabilizing influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL101.A;They do not understand our destiny…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL106.T;Formation of the Agence Continentale d'Amérigue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL106.D;The Agence Continentale d’Amérigue (Continental Agency of Ameriga, ACA) was created in $YEAR$ by a group of Atlantian newspaper and wire service owners led by press baron Guillaume Déat and telegram magnate Marcel Laval. While not legally connected to the government at first, the ACA’s board of directors were all members of the pan-nationalist Ariboua Club and supported the Club’s aims. The ACA was the first Atlantian company to operate its own dedicated telegram service, enabling it to outspeed many competitors. The ACA would first aggressively consolidate the domestic market before expanding across Ameriga, ensuring that Atlantian-slanted content would appear to as broad an audience as possible. While a combination of antitrust lawsuits and financial troubles led to its nationalization in the 1930s, the ACA would dominate Amerigan media for many decades. Most famous of all was their motto, which soon came to symbolize their brand image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL106.A;”Juste et Équilibré !”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL107.T;The Agence Continentale d’Amérigue Enters $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL107.D;The Agence Continentale d’Amérigue (Continental Agency of Ameriga, ACA) was a news and telegram corporation formed in Atlantia but later expanding across the continent. While its speed and availability were unparalleled, the newspapers under its label were also accused of being biased towards Atlantia, pan-Amerigan nationalism, and liberalism and republicanism in general. Now the ACA has bought out some struggling local papers in $CAPITAL$ and merged them into a single company, the $CAPITAL$ Star. The Star has is quickly becoming notorious for its emotional, human-centered coverage and fiery liberal-populist editorials. If we don’t take action then more newspapers nationwide will be bought out by the ACA and its messages will begin to infect our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL107.A;That’s the price of freedom of expression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL107.B;Try to buy out their issues before they hit the streets and burn them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL107.C;Pass a law forbidding them to publish here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL108.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares the ACA a Foreign Agent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL108.D;The ACA syndicate’s efforts to expand business into $FROMCOUNTRY$ triggered a furious response from their government. Denouncing them as the “agents of a foreign power,” they have passed a harsh new law empowering them to forbid any employee or organ of the ACA from conducting business in their nation. Ominously, the wording of the law could in theory allow them to censor any newspaper in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Interventionist politicians – and the ACA’s wealthy owners, Déat and Laval – are now calling on our government to demand that $FROMCOUNTRY$ lift its restrictions or face the “abrupt introduction of democracy.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL108.A;Bully!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL108.B;Threaten war, over NEWSPAPERS? Ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL109.T;Atlantia Demands an End to Our Censorship;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL109.D;“I can imagine no greater disservice to a country than to establish a system of censorship that would deny to the people of a free nation their indisputable right to criticize their own public officials. While exercising the great powers of the office I hold, I would regret in a crisis like the one through which $COUNTRY$ is now passing to lose the benefit of patriotic and intelligent criticism – as should any man in a position of national leadership.” – Atlantian President Seymour Hetzel\n\nOur efforts to suppress the ACA have provoked bitter condemnation from the Atlantians. They have distorted our defense of our national sovereignty into the caricature of despotism, and now demand that we lift all restrictions on public expression. To bow to such an ultimatum would be a black mark on our independence but refusing could allow Atlantian jingoists to drum up war hysteria against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL109.A;Fine, sell your damned newspapers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL109.B;These insults are mere bluster, we are not afraid of Atlantia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL110.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Lifts Press Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL110.D;The tyrants of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have seen reason, and in a rare moment of wisdom, have ended the censorship of their media. Their people now enjoy full freedom of expression, and the ACA’s profits are already rising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL110.A;Thank God for President Hetzel – he kept us out of war!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL111.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Stands Defiant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL111.D;The tyrants of $FROMCOUNTRY$ remain unwilling to allow their people the freedom of expression which all of mankind deserves as a natural right. They have dismissed our petitions and mocked us for advocating for an unfettered press! Clearly, they are a threat to the peace and liberty of the continent. Something must be done about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL111.A;“I want YOU for the Atlantian Army – nearest recruiting station.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL112.T;Rebels Receive $FROM_ADJ$ Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL112.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has become an open backer of rebel groups in $COUNTRY$, owing to their opposition to our government. The form of this support varies – be it providing actual supplies, advocating for the rebels’ political views, or allowing the rebels and their sympathizers to conduct fundraising programs in $FROMCOUNTRY$ - but they have clearly sided against us. This aid has not been for nothing and in fact has seriously worsened our security situation. The coming weeks will be decisive in determining our future. We could use this as grounds for war with $FROMCOUNTRY$, try to suppress the unrest anyway…or, perhaps, take this as a sign that the time has come to relinquish our power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL112.A;$FROMCOUNTRY$ will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL112.B;The military can handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL112.C;Retirement doesn’t sound so bad…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL113.T;$FROM_ADJ$ Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL113.D;In a boisterous speech, the leader of $FROMCOUNTRY$ denounced us for “intolerable interference” and “acts of aggression,” declaring $COUNTRY$ to have become an open enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Shortly after his address, a diplomat from $COUNTRY$ delivered an official declaration of war against us! In hindsight, we should have expected this to happen, given our open support for rebel groups within $FROMCOUNTRY$ - unless this was our plan all along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL113.A;Oh…of course! The fools played right into our hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL114.T;Cleaning House;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL114.D;The police and military intelligence groups did not delay in rooting out the traitorous elements who had received the greatest amount of foreign aid. Some had been almost public with their criminality, while others had not hidden their tracks well enough. Unfortunately, such a large-scale crackdown on subversives was not without consequences. Many lesser conspirators were able to either go into hiding or flee the country, and Nouvelle-Amsterdam is already denouncing us for our actions. If enough traitors are able to worm their way into the confidence of foreign powers, this could mean war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL114.A;Keeping $COUNTRY$ clean is not for the faint of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL115.T;Violent Purges Across $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL115.D;We have been supporting the heroic revolutionaries of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their fight against their tyrannical and oppressive government, but now they have been dealt a bitter blow. The regime launched a nation-wide purge against those valiantly fighting for freedom, and many heroes were either imprisoned or killed. Many more have fled the country, and quite a few made their way to Nouvelle-Amsterdam. Now they are urging our government to not let these atrocities go unpunished, but instead take up the sword of liberation and bring freedom to $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL115.A;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL116.T;Unforseen Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL116.D;As it turned out, the rebels were already far more well-prepared than we had thought. With large stockpiles of supplies and plenty of sympathizers within the armed forces, they were able to use the chaos of the attempted purge to instigate a coup d’etat. The old regime found its own soldiers turning upon it, and many ordinary citizens who had no previous loyalty to the rebel cause took up the banner of revolt for their own reasons. As a result, the government has disintegrated and a new, liberal republic has been erected in its place. Whether this new order will last is anybody’s guess but for the moment it appears that we have become a democracy whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL116.A;The people have prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL117.T;Regime Change in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL117.D;Our efforts to support the heroic rebel cause in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have paid off. Their former tyrannical government tried to crack down upon its challengers, but in doing so stirred its enemies to overthrow it. A new, liberal republic has been formed, and its leadership has wasted no time in affirming their commitment to warm relations with $COUNTRY$. $FROMCOUNTRY$, once a fortress of autocracy, now basks in the light of liberty and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL117.A;And the world grows that much more safe for democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL118.T;The $FROM_ADJ$ Regime Steps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL118.D;Our efforts to support the heroic rebel cause in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have paid off. Rather than face the prospect of outright revolution, the old government chose to peacefully relinquish power. A new, liberal republic has been formed, and its leadership has wasted no time in affirming their commitment to warm relations with $COUNTRY$. The lack of decisive military victory over the former regime means that its supporters may seek to restore it at some point in the future but for now its people rejoice in their newfound freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL118.A;Mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF13.T;Rise of the Démocrates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF13.D;The refusal of the old liberal parties to compromise on issues like welfare and corporate regulation has led veteran liberal Philippe Sorel to found his own party. Sorel started out as a police officer who, moved by the destitution of Nouvelle Amsterdam’s slums, gave up his badge to tackle poverty head on. While eventually becoming a national representative, repeated charges of socialism from those within his own party kept him out of the presidency for years, and now he has struck out on his own. Known as the Parti Démocrate, the party supports immigration, government relief for the poor, economic regulations, and even the emerging “natural conservation” movement. Sorel has drawn criticism for his contradictory remarks on foreign interventionism, but if the number of defecting liberals and moderate socialists which the Démocrates have absorbed is any indication, he has already shattered the country’s political status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF13.A;“Friends, the choice is this : reform today, or revolution tomorrow.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF14.T;The ACA Falters;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF14.T;The ACA (Continental Agency of Ameriga) news syndicate enjoyed unparalleled dominance for years, but by $YEAR$ it began to stumble. Charles Déat and Emil Laval, the sons of its founders, inherited their fathers’ businesses but not their camaraderie. Whereas Déat sought relentless expansion into foreign markets, Laval (who had always been gifted with electronics) insisted that the ACA had to embrace radio to stay competitive. Déat dismissed radio as a mere fad but Laval declared that Déat’s failure to embrace new technology would bury the ACA. Their disputes culminated in a famous shouting match in the front lobby of ACA headquarters, where Déat threatened to buy Laval out of the company. The next morning, Laval stopped Déat at the front doors and, before a shocked crowd of employees, tore up his own ACA stock certificate in front of his colleague’s eyes and announced his resignation. Before storming off, he pointed to the shreds of his certificate and made a notorious boast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF14.A;“I’ll make ALL of that back, in two years, from radio alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF15.T;Formation of the Laval Radio Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF15.D;Emil Laval, former co-owner of ACA, had been fascinated by radio technology since childhood. He studied radio in college, becoming the star pupil of physicist Benjamin Le Pen and eventually marrying his niece, Camille. Shortly before his dramatic resignation, Laval had filed a patent for what he called an “aliapotential” radio receiver, a system which offered a tremendous increase in frequency quality and would eventually become the global standard. Laval wasted no time in reinvesting his profits into a series of radio stations, the first registered at his home laboratory in northern Nouvelle Amsterdam. He went on to form the Laval Radio Corporation and Laval Broadcasting Service and is known today as the “godfather of commercial radio.” In an act of spite, Laval forbade any of his stations from carrying ACA content, instead offering its services to the ACA’s competitors. By $YEAR$, the ACA’s near-monopoly on news media was cracking, and Laval more than made good on his threat to Déat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF15.A;“Laval : Hear the Power!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF16.T;Nationalization of the ACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF16.D;The early months of $YEAR$ saw the Agence Continentale d’Amérigue (ACA) post its worst quarterly earnings in its history. Years of antitrust lawsuits, the growth of competing syndicates, and the emergence of radio broadcasting all eroded the ACA’s former invulnerability. Furthermore, its management under Charles Déat following the departure of Emil Laval was erratic and shortsighted. Déat, obsessed with the notion of expanding the ACA northward into the Arcadian and European markets to become “the syndicate of the world,” overstretched its resources. By the time he tried to fix his mistakes by signing deals with radio services and acquiring magazines, it was too late for both him and the ACA. Déat was bought out, before the rest of the board reached a settlement with the government to auction parts of the syndicate off to pay its debts and nationalize the rest. It became the official state news service of $COUNTRY$, pivoting from newspapers to radio and later television,.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF16.A;But why do its broadcasters have such stiff accents?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF17.T;Maximilien Danton and the Surrealists;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF17.D;The eldest son of press baron Guillaume Déat and originally intended to inherit his business, Maximilien Déat was disowned by his father amidst strong allegations of his homosexuality. He purchased a one-way ticket to Anvers and spent the next decade travelling through the cities and countrysides of Europe, assuming his mother Yvonne’s maiden name. Danton sympathized with the emerging counterculture of European artists, who felt that middle-class consumerism and rationalism were corrupting the popular mind. In $YEAR$, he convened a meeting of artists in Amsterdam where they drafted and published the Surrealist Manifesto. Declaring their love of “the illogical, the psychic, the brilliant light of the highest planes of the spirit,” the Surrealists used psychology to channel the unconscious mind into their art. Danton, nicknamed “La Comete” for his spectacular style and unconventional sexuality, embraced poetry as his medium, scandalizing Europe with wild and provocative language while railing against the bourgeoise values which he saw as the greatest threat to humanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF17.A;Flashing across the azure like an aeroplane, heralding the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF170.T;Recognition of Beornian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF170.D;During the Wars of Religion, English Protestants fled to Burgundy. The West Indies Company recruited these refugees to settle in Burgundian Lotharingia, then a struggling colony which was sold to the WIC. The discovery of gold in the region brought waves of new, non-English settlers, causing Burgundy to buy back the colony. To avoid assimilation, rural English families received permission from the governor to settle west of the Silver River, technically voiding their status as Burgundian subjects. These new settlements eventually became the Kingdom of Beornia, which officially separated from Lotharingia in 1817 during the tumult of its independence and civil war. Up until now, we refused to recognize Beornia as an independent state, considering their history, but at this point they have endured for long enough that doing so no longer serves a purpose. A Burgundian embassy has been opened in Camelot, and today, a Beornian one in Anvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF170.A;Odd that the ruling party’s rivals are often assigned to Camelot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF18.T;Burgundy Recognizes Our Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF18.D;Ever since we finished dissolving our bonds with the Burgundian crown and with Lotharingia in 1817, our relations with Anvers have been strained. To put it bluntly, Burgundy did not acknowledge our existence, referring to us as a “colony in insurrection.” With the passage of time and our endurance as an independent state, however, they have finally been forced to accept us among the states of the world. A Burgundian embassy has opened in Camelot, and we have sent some of our greatest statesmen to Anvers to oversee the opening of an embassy of our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF18.A;Perhaps one day we shall stand together against the Anglois?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF19.T;Final Repayment of Amazonie’s Debt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF19.D;When Amazonie was a colony of our realm, it incurred tremendous debts from the massive Anglois garrisons required to suppress revolts by slaves, attacks by natives, and, towards the end of our rule of Amazonie, disturbances by liberal rebels in Equinoxia. We have continued to hold Amazonie to this debt after their independence – rather than money, the Planteurs have made their payments in goods such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco. Another advantage of this arrangement was forcing Amazonie merchants to do business in our ports, as the cost of voyages meant that none could survive if they made an empty voyage back across the Atlantic. Today marks the end of these cash crop payments, as the final fleet of Amazonie vessels have weighed anchor from Rouen and are now bound for home. While we shall continue our economic presence in Ameriga, we may need to take a more active role from this point onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF19.A;Show me the mon- er, goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF20.T;The Cancellation of our Debt to the Anglois;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF20.D;Amazonie spent tremendous sums on Anglois garrisons to suppress rebellions during its colonial era – sums it did not have in cash at the time. We have been repaying it in goods such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton, but now it appears that our obligations have been unexpectedly ended. The fall of the previous Anglois government has allowed us to seize the opportunity to repudiate all outstanding debts to them, to avoid any successor seeking to redeem it for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF20.A;Our sovereignty is unassailable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF21.T;The Anglois in Port Sucre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF21.D;Ever since the city of Port Sucre’s founding, the Anglois have always enjoyed special trading rights – the city has the highest concentration of Anglois citizens and expatriates in Ameriga. Their economic influence and investment in the port city was so great that they preserved many of these rights even after the end of their direct rule in Ameriga. Now an Anglois ambassador has approached our foreign minister and explained his government’s view on the “situation of Port Sucre.” The gist of his message is that the Dual Monarchy will not interfere with our annexation of Port Sucre – if, that is, we avoiding opening the city up to Burgundian competition. It may be unwise to tip our hands to European empires, but the Anglois are notoriously sensitive to curtailments of their commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF21.A;All traders are equal but the Anglois may be more equal than others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF21.B;Ridiculous. They must follow the laws like everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF22.T;Our Trading Privileges in Port Sucre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF22.D;The loss of our direct control over Port Sucre did not mean the end of our influence there. As the foremost concentration of Anglois subjects in Ameriga, we have worked to defend our economic position within the city. Thankfully, its absorption into Atlantia will not change this situation. The Atlantians have made it clear to our ambassador that the Anglois presence in Port Sucre will not be suppressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF22.A;Business as usual, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF23.T;Atlantia Annuls our Trading Privileges in Port Sucre!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF23.D;Port Sucre is the foremost concentration of Anglois subjects in Ameriga, and thus we have worked to defend our economic position within it. Now, however, the Atlantians have declared their intent to abolish all prior special trading agreements within the city! Our ministers are convinced that this is the opening shot in an effort to curtail Anglois influence across Atlantia and reach out to rival powers such as Burgundy. Unfortunately, the laws in this matter are murky and we cannot immediately resort to war without being condemned by the international community. However, we could impose an embargo upon Atlantia in lieu of direct force. Given our worldwide economic presence, it would deal a significant blow to Atlantian commerce and could force them to capitulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF23.A;Let them feel the burden of their own arrogance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF23.B;We must accept this new situation, and not give in to hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF24.T;The Anglois Embargo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF24.D;Our curtailment of the Dual Monarchy’s special trading rights in Port Sucre were met with blistering condemnation from Paris. In response, they have organized a complete embargo of our nation, directing their merchants and those of their colonies and satellites to withhold any business with Atlantia. Obviously such activity will be able to continue in a limited fashion through subtler channels, but it may take years before our economy fully adjusts to being cut off from the Anglois market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF24;A;All this over one city?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF25.T;The Dual Monarchy Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF25.D;We had feared that the Anglois might overreact to our curtailment of their special privileges, but they have proven to be more conciliatory than we had expected. Their reaction to our announcement was notably muted, and our diplomatic contact continues as usual. This whole episode is now being seen as an overblown affair which should never have provoked such anxiety and will hopefully be forgotten as our nations continue their coexistence. Of course, there is something to be said for having stood up to the Dual Monarchy and prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF26.T;Our Relatives in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF26.D;The van de Graaf family of northern Lotharingia is descended from a venerable Brabantian house in Burgundy – a house which has been lacking scions. Word has reached them of the death of Albert van der Graaf, last male member of the European line. He willed his assets to be divided up amongst the Lotharingian van de Graafs, but there is an issue. Ever since our independence from Burgundy, Chef de Aigle forbade Lotharingian citizens from inheriting property in Burgundy, to prevent any possible intrusion of Burgundian influence into our nation. Now the van de Graafs are petitioning the government to alter the law and permit them to receive their inheritance. We have reason to believe that the Burgundian government is watching this affair to gauge the possibility of reopening ties to our nation. Should we let the inheritance go forward and in doing so begin to normalize our relations with Burgundy, or block it and reaffirm our hostility to our old overlord?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF26.A;Some barriers to inheritance could be removed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF26.B;Burgundy is GONE from Lotharingia and will NEVER return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF27.D; The van de Graaf family of northern Lotharingia is descended from a venerable Brabantian house in Burgundy – a house which has been lacking scions. Word has reached them of the death of Geert van der Graaf, last male member of the European line. He willed his assets to be divided up amongst the Lotharingian van de Graafs, but was feared that a long-standing law forbidding inheritance of Burgundian property (promulgated by Lotharingia’s paranoid ruler, Denis de Aigle) would leave them in the lurch. Thankfully, the Lotharingian government amended the law to allow the transfer to be carried out. The whole episode is seen by those in Burgundy, especially the high society, that Lotharingia is warming up to us once again and that it may be time to consider a more prominent role in its affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF28.T;The Eriksen Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF28.D;A dispute has arisen involving a consortium of northern tobacco planteurs and Eriksen Shipping, a firm owned by Scandinavian expatriate Dag Eriksen. The consortium is believed to have grown lax in its record-keeping, allowing the firm to assume certain observational duties. An investigation discovered that a substantial amount was missing from the latest shipment, and the most likely suspects are the crew themselves. They will face trial in Scandinavia, but now the tobacco consortium is demanding the revocation of Eriksen’s license to operate in Lotharingia, charging that his company was negligent in failing to police their own employees. Eriksen in turn argues that it was the fault of the planteurs for failing to keep accurate records. The Scandinavian government is watching the matter closely, and has made it clear that if we side with the planteurs then they will make it known that Lotharingia is not a safe place to do business – which could have dire effects upon our economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF28.A;The consortium’s own slothfulness brought this upon themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF29.T;The Eriksen Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF29.D;A dispute has arisen involving Eriksen Shipping, a Lotharingian firm owned by Scandinavian expatriate Dag Eriksen, and a consortium of northern tobacco planteurs. The consortium is believed to have grown lax in its record-keeping, with vital documents misfiled. An investigation discovered that a substantial amount was missing from the latest shipment, and the crew are now on trial for larceny. However, the tobacco consortium demanded the revocation of Eriksen’s license to operate in Lotharingia, blaming him and his company for allowing the thefts. Despite the clear negligence of the consortium, the Lotharingian government complied, and now Eriksen is petitioning us for redress. While armed action would be the swiftest solution, our minister of finance has proposed that we punish them by spreading the word that Lotharingia cannot be financially trusted and that lenders and merchants should steer clear of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF29.A;Such an erratic and biased government is clearly a credit risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF29.B;They will apologize when our warships train their guns on them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF30.T;Scandinavian Slander;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF30.D;While Scandinavia has declined to pursue military retaliation against us for ejecting Eriksen’s business from the country, they have instead chosen to cast doubt upon our nation’s integrity in the international market. Already most Scandinavian creditors have refused any new attempt by Lotharingian citizens to borrow funds, and other nations are beginning to follow suit. While our reputation will recover in the future, it seems as though Lotharingia is entering a period in which foreign finances will be hard to come by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

His economic guidance paved the way for Atlantia to become a modern powerhouse of industry and culture. Now a group of businessmen with ties to the Inca Empire have proposed to construct a statue of the former Director to honor his memory, as well as forge a diplomatic bond with the Inca.

Both of us won our freedom from Spanish dominance, albeit in different ways. And we both have a shared interest in keeping Ameriga safe for democracy, even if “Romantic democracy” is somewhat idiosyncratic. Therefore we should reach out fo the Quiteneses to cement our ties into a formal military alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Hetzel_Doctrine_title;The Hetzel Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Hetzel_Doctrine_desc;$COUNTRY$ was established not to create wealth but to realize a vision, an ideal – to discover and maintain liberty among men. For liberty is its own reward. It is better to belong to a poor nation that is free than a rich nation which has ceased to love the natural rights of mankind. But without labor and care, liberty shall wither. The past shows us that freedom does not emerge from a balance of power : tyranny flourishes when it is allowed to feed upon other tyrannies to sustain itself. There must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power : not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace.” – Atlantian President Seymour Hetzel\n\nThe Hetzel Doctrine states that $COUNTRY$ reserves the right to intervene in the political conditions of other Amerigan states “in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power and to safeguard the peoples of the continent from domination.” Be it via economic influence, political pressure, or outright military force, we must keep Ameriga free from both foreign and domestic tyrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AMA34.T;The city of Ploumanao ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.D;The great age of piracy in Ameriga had seen various Breton sailors join the pirates because of the suffering they endured on colonial ships. Infamous among them was Barba-Du, Black Beard who raided successfully several Spanish islands. In the XVIIth century, pirates and smugglers sailed the Amazon river to escape colonial authorities. There they established an outpost among the Manao people, later becoming the city of Ploumanao, which developed as a port of adventurers and escapees, developing their own dialect of Breton colored with the local Arauaki language. The Anglois and Spanish governors heard of the place, but none of the expeditions they sent could successfully claim the place and its people, defeated by the treacherous waters and tropical diseases along with political divisions as to whom the city belonged. Meanwhile the Bretons of the Jungle thrived, dealing regularly with merchants from Saint George. Eventually $COUNTRY$ managed to make them accept its domination in $YEAR$, but they would keep their particularism and their language well beyond the XXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

We have taken back our land to see it filled with weird Protestant sects and powerful cattle owners styling themselves 'Barons', and one of the main reasons of their backwardness. \n \n Now is the time for us to decide how to administrate these lands and especially the property. The land here has been forcefully taken by a few landlords following the treacherous agreement of 1817 and we could take the occasion of the conquest to open the vast plains to foreign settlement, at the expanse of the locals' loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN2.D;New-Mercia has been for some years already integrated in our nation but the fact remains that Edward's Landing is not easily reachable. The Andine passes are scarce and not usable during winter, and many bureaucrats in our government prefer to round Land's End rather than take the land road. Already the frontier spirit has made the local Beornians quite different from their brothers and sisters across the Andes and it has been suggested that we could recognize a local autonomy to New-Mercia which could certainly help their development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN3.T;The English Monarchy in exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.D;Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga. Even if technically independent earlier than Amazonia, this land was only settled by English settlers from the Lotharingian colony during the XVIIth century, crossing the Odon river and destroying the short-lived settlement of Argentine. Living in small towns often unknown by the Lotharingian governor, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture. From that chaos, emerged strong landowners, that rule over the lands like feudal lords. One of them, Harold Cavendish proclaimed himself King 'of the house of England' in 1822. Now his son Edward rules, and the path of possibles is open for the young European-educated King who must choose between the traditional mindset of the Cattle Barons and the new ideas he learnt and practised in Prague and have become shared in the cities of the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.A;Long live Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.T;20 years of independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.D;Beornia was recognized as a separate entity in 1817 by the Charlemagne agreement that saw the colonial governor of Lotharingia agreeing to name the Cattle Baron Harold Cavendish, 'Lieutenant-Governor of the Crown colony of Southern Lotharingia'. While Beornia was only recognized independent in 1822 by the Lotharingian revolutionaries, it was the first act that split the lands across the Odon and the Bernicia from the rest of the colony. Not many celebrations were held, for the monarchy celebrates the Crowning of Harold rather than the agreement that allowed him to rise to power under Burgundian authority. But for Edward, who recalls these events as the reason for being sent away to the wonders of Europe, it seems that date was of special interest for he took the occasion to summon the rump Parliament in Camelot in two weeks for 'an important occasion'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.A;What does the young man want ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.T;The Parliament session;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.D;When Harold crowned himself King of Beornia in 1822, he decided to create a Parliament based on the English Parliament of old. But he never meant for the Commons and Lords to have but an advisory role, and he seldom summoned sessions. His son has seen much throughout Europe, in his years of studies, studying the Constitutions and seeing the ways of ruling. Edward has big plans for his country and has wondered for years how to realize them. Autocracy has its advantages and would placate the will of his uncle and the Cattle Barons but perhaps it is time that the Beornian Parliament becomes a true political power, on the Scandinavian or Burgundian model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN6.T;Industry in Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.D;Edward I took great interests in the steelworks of Prague and Anvers during his studies and was always impressed by the new forces of industry that could make small villages, new towns of steel and cement. But in Beornia, the new ideas spread slowly. The Barons of the interior which control nearly all lands in the interior have expressed disinterest or even hatred towards Europe and its new inventions, the most devout seeing it as a tool of the devil. The King has invited many European scholars and some of his old friends to implement changes, but his uncle Charles, leader of the Barons, has asked in a session of Parliament to focus the effort of the monarchy on the interior rather than spending time and money on fruitless efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.A;Barons are the past of this country, we must look to the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.B;We must tend to the earth to not lose the Beornian soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.T;The immigration bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.D;Immigration to Beornia always was quite small. Few people were ready to leave Europe to end up in a poor and forgotten land and the Beornians only welcomed English among their own. The King has decided to regulate immigration formally but he has seen opposition from the old guard who holds true the words of the previous sovereign 'No tainted blood should spoil the virgin soil of our England in exile'. they ask that the Bureau of Immigration be used to ensure that only White Anglo-Saxon Protestants should be able to enter the country. A compromise faction wants to enlarge the criteria to include all Protestants, even not Germanic, while Liberals and captains of industry want to attract from everywhere in Europe, be they Jewish or Papists. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.A;Beornians can tolerate anyone, open immigration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN8.T;The Gordon riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.D;The Immigration Bill had attracted vigorous criticism from the Church and the devout who saw the authorization of non-Protestant immigrants as a moral failure of the government and the King. Tensions have been high in Camelot for months, especially as the Bauernite preacher William Gordon denounced the Popish plot that had infiltrated the Beornian government to usher in the arrival of the Antichrist. they erupted in a violent pogrom as a Catholic mission was burnt and the priest beaten up and nearly hanged before the Royal men-at-arms could intervene. The demonstration could hardly be controlled by the police and it took the intervention of the regiments stationed in the capital to end the riots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN9.T;The Camelot insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.D;As the policies of the King followed the vision of his uncle Charles and more generally the Cattle Barons, the absolute and reactionary rule of the monarchy began to become more criticized in the coastal cities and the capital. Widely unpopular there, shadow conspiracies working with the bludgeoning docker and workers trade unions sought to destroy the monarchy and proclaim a Republic. Now the day has come, several quarters of the capital have risen up and the fate of Beornia seems undecided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN14.D;The last decades have seen a lot of changes in Beornia, often criticized by the Cattle Barons but nonetheless seen as needed by most of the population. Yesterday, the head of the aristocratic faction died. Brother and uncle to kings, Charles had incarnated the aristocratic stubbornness and was seen by many as a relic of the chaotic post-independence time. With their charismatic leader gone, most of the Cattle Barons and preachers from the interior have now decided to accept the new Beornia and it seems that tensions between the coast and the interior have declined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

They attempted to have the King's uncle take power by a coup but were crushed in the attempt as Edward I refused to lay down his power. Now his uncle has been put under house arrest while many Barons had their lands confiscated and redistributed, securing the flame of freedom in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN17.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. Edward accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN18.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. When they arrived, Edward had already fled on a ship to New Mercia where he was hailed as the rightful King when he arrived weeks after his uncle had been crowned in Camelot. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society, 'from one ocean to the next'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN19.D;'The Beornians are a'thick with red, from the flags they bear, to their clothes, to the very essence of their being. If you ever thought the vatican had their fair plate of the dye, then I'd say the Beornians got the whole pot.' \n\n Cochineal red has been our mainstay colour ever since James Oakes looted the insects & the dye from an incan outpost back in the 17th century, it has been perhaps, the one good mainstay of economic life for many smaller, sedentary families in the west of our country. It's bright colour, waving in every street of our cities, towns and villages. All who live in these great plains know that when the tide of red is on the horizon, you better be wearing red too. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN20.T;A curious family reunion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.D;A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as Jean de Courtenay, a French explorer on his way to the Pacific, was thrown out the Carter household. He said to have taken the opportunity to visit his distant cousins, claiming that the Carters were Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650. It came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen : John Carter, a cattle baron close to the Royal family,  had formalized English grammar while his son and heir Alfred was a renowned historian on Anglo-Saxon times. To learn that an Anglois would try and slander their good name was the grievest insult they could have received and they acted accordingly, throwing him to the street and shouting at him until he left. Nonetheless, the claims of de Courtenay were validated years later in a famous history book on the Argentine colony that produced papers signed by Henri de Courtenay, the man that had betrayed the colony in exchange for a guarantee of protection for his properties. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN22.T;The Camblesforth raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.D;Life on the Beornian frontier can be harsh, as cattle herders and their families must face the hardships of the Beornian interior alongside the threat of the savages that squat the lands. Or so claims Charles of Beornia that was called to the capital by his nephew following the news of the Camblesforth raid. Producing several witnesses, he justified his expedition against a Mapuche tribe, claiming that he did what the Royal army could not do : protect innocent Christian folks from heathen demons. The court was especially moved by the fate of Amelia Goodman, who had been kidnapped by a Mapuche group and forced to marry by force his captor. Edward who had wanted to punish his uncle for the burning and massacre of an entire village to reduce his influence in the interiror was thus forced to accept the testimonies and let his uncle go, with even more popularity than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.A;He did well I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.T;Nemec Cotton;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.D;Wolfgang Nemec was a close friend of Edward he met in Prague during his study years in Europe. Last son of a Bohemian noble, he took an interest for cultivation during his youth and became one of the leading agronomic engineers in Europe. Visiting Beornia to look through the soils and the way to better cultivation in the kingdom of his old friend, he presented Edward with a plan to cultivate cotton as a new crop in the kingdom. Having studied suitable plots of lands in Eoferwic, Nemec was given by royal decree the empty fields to cultivate his cotton. Soon a great success, it however clashed with local gentry who had used these as grazing lands for their herds and tried several times to have the cotton removed for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN24.T;A preacher's word;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.D;The Church of Beornia is a very decentralized Christian confession with a lot of variation in creed and practices throughout the Beornian parishes. The Anglican convention was established by the monarchy during independence to regulate the faith under the supervision of the King but it had few effects outside of urban parishes. For example, in the interior, the cult of Saint Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon King of England spread following the preaching of Branson Cromwell, a priest from Sharow. The convention tried several times to have him revoked but his charisma entitled him the support of his parish and the most devout throughout the country. One of his lasting legacy besides the cult of Harold was his insistence on marriage and births, claiming as Abraham was promised to have 'his seed greatly multiply as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore', it was needed by the Beornians to abide by the decrees of God and multiply so that their seed shall possess the gate of their enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN25.D;Jonathan Saltvick was a member of the so called Edwardian circle, this gathering of various European nobles and bourgeois he had met during his studies and that he entertained over the years in Camelot or during his travels. An engineer from Scotland, he was responsible for determining that the river cities could utilise the river power to establish water mills by creating concentrated water flows and manipulating flood water with wheels. Having secured royal funding, he started in New Jerusalem a system of small-time businesses with semi-automated water-powered processes. Due to him, New Jerusalem boomed with Riverside businesses and his method became a common mark along the Silver River and a common sight in Beornian paitings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN26.T;A mutinous welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.D;The Bounty was an Anglois ship from Liverpool that sailed from England in $YEAR$ to cross the Horn and sell goods in Zhourao. The captain, Auguste Blanc, a Frenchman, had hired a crew composed mostly of Englishmen notably for their small wages and directed the ship like a dictator. The crew conspired against him and had him put under the brig after he had one of his men whipped for having interpreted his talk in English to be an insult. The crew then sailed to New London where they were met as heroes by the population after their explanation of their act. The Beornian government had the ship and his goods given back to the armator but all the crew was given Beornian citizenry and they soon became national heroes proving that the English soul only waited a true English country to stir again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.A;We celebrate a mutiny then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN27.T;Strange Rumblings in the Former Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN27.D;Ever since the first barbarians entered the lands which they would dub Beornia, they have been reliant upon pastoralism for their economic survival. Cattle were always the backbone of Beornia, allowing Beornian barons to amass great power through their herds. Our purging of said “nobles” after the war shattered this old order and left much of Beornia’s cattle under uncertain ownership. Now the local governor has directed his administration to seize both cattle herds and the lands which they commonly live upon, placing them under formal state ownership. While this is in line with normal imperial law, it has outraged the local savages, who have begun looking for ways to challenge what they see as the disappearance of their last vestige of independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN27.A;Who cares about those barbarians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN28.T;Rise of the Beornian Fundamentalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN28.D;When we defeated Beornia, we purged its barons to destroy their power, but this has led to the vacuum being filled by bishops and other religious cranks. Now a former Beornian army chaplain known only as “John Faith” has begun travelling the region, advocating a violent, millenarian form of Beornian Anglican Christianity. Seeking to restore Anglican “fundamentals,” they glorify holy war and martyrdom, claiming that the end of the world is nigh and that both Beornia and their god will soon return. However, they also provide social assistance like feeding the poor, making them quite popular. A Burgundian scholar in Cusco has compared these “Fundamentalists” with the Agonistici, a group of Christian radicals in Roman North Africa in the fourth century who incited slave revolts and glorified martyrdom. §RAs of now the Fundamentalists are a mere nuisance. If an armed rebellion were to ever seize Camelot, however, they could cause it to morph into a full-fledged Beornian restoration.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NAN28.A;“Oh, John! Keep us safe! He’s gonna march us right through Eden’s Gate!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN29.T;Resurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN29.D;“For our sake, our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, but he rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven. For our sake, Saint Harold laid down his life in the name of holy England. And for our sake, Beornia was crucified, and died, but now, BEORNIA IS RISEN! The kingdom of the New Jerusalem has COME! All hail the return of the holiest realm, fortress of His true chosen people!” – John Faith\n\nThe leader of the Funadmentalists entered Camelot upon a white horse, leading an army of followers bearing crosses and banners. Upon his arrival at the old St. George’s Catheral, he declared the restoration of Beornia, and announced that the “apocalyptic clash of the hosts of God and the Devil” were imminent. The whole southern frontier of the empire is awash with crazed fanatics, and all order southeast of the Andes is collapsing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN29.A;We will slaughter those savages like the cattle they are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN30.T;Faithless;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN30.D;The destruction of the Beornian fanatics was never in doubt. Once they came up against true soldiers of the Sapa Inca, they crumbled, and we easily scythed them down. Faith himself attempted to die a martyr’s death on the battlefield but was knocked unconscious by a misfiring cannon. After being flayed alive before the Sapa Inca, Faith’s body was burned and his ashes scattered into the ocean, rather than give the savages another corpse to worship. The destruction of the Fundamentalist cult, the purging of Anglican priests across Beornia, and the humiliating capture and execution of their leader, seems to have broken the spirit of Beornian nationalism. It may rise again in another era, but it will never carry the same primitive zealotry of Faith’s madness, and for now the southern plains are once again at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN30.A;Once again, their false god failed to save their king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NAN311.T;Rise of Beornian Israelism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN311.D;A strange Christian cult is sweeping the rural provinces. Beornian Israelism weaves nationalism, Protestant mysticism, and questionable history and archaeology to allege that the English founders of Beornia were the direct descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of ancient Israel. While the idea that certain Europeans are descended from the Israelites is not new, men such as Harold Parfitt, a self-educated lecturer and businessman, are now spreading this notion through mutual aid societies. Parfitt has organized the Metropolitan Anglo-Israel Community to group all Beornian Israelites under one banner. MAIC holds that most Israelites are not Jews, but Samaritans of the Kingdom of Israel. They use linguistics to argue that the English came from the Mideast, the English (and by extension the Beornian) throne is the heir of the Davidic throne, and that Beornians are the inheritors of Jacob's birthright. While often disdained by Anglican priests these cults appeal to rural communities who seek proof of ethnic, cultural, and national supremacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZFL1.T;La Petite Argentine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZFL1.D;Amazonie does not have too many special holidays, but for one region in particular, today marks an important one indeed. The City of Le Nouveau Havre marks it's 200th Anniversary of the exodus of most of the families that inhabit the city from their original colony, renamed Camelot by the English that drove them out. The former Port, dedicated to the Anglois Silver Fleet, was under protected & undervalued by Anglois authorities, wanting to permit every last ounce of silver to come back to Europe. The colony was finally lost as the invading Beornians captured and looted the city in 1667 but its people carried with them their spirit and culture. The region of the Havre is known as the "Little Argentine", for that was the name of the Anglois colony and were you to ask how the inhabitants would identify themselves, they'd say proudly that they are Argentins. The only problem that arose was that a Beornian trader was thrown into the port -but saved by bystanders- as the crowd shouted 'On se souvient!' (we remember);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF2.T;Rivenzi's Silk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF2.D;Matteo Rivenzi was an Italian immigrant from Lucca that ended up settling in Lotharingia after independence, fleeing political infighting in the Duchy as he has been a notable Republican during the Etrurian wars. A silk worker, he worked to introduce silkworms in Lotharingia and was successful in establishing a reliable silk industry in Transfleuve, being awarded a national award by De Aigle for having helped his country as a true Lotharian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF3.D;Cattle herding has been the economical backbone of the southern Lotharians, the figure of the vacher fighting for his freedom, being an important part of the national mythos. But as cities grow, cattlers old grazing grounds are bought by urban people and the rural herds are pushed more and more to the interior. A series of demonstrations took over the country as cattlers gathered their herds and marched into the cities to demand that their ancestral cattlers rights be respected by urban Lotharians and the authorities. The most known of these cattle demonstrations occured in $YEAR$ when the cattlers walked on Fort Lothère, severely disrupting the capital for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF4.T;Nouvelle-Anglie against Carijoux;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF4.D;The city of Nouvelle-Anglie was established in 1704 near Domecy by Anglo-Lotharian settlers on an island that had belonged to a Carijoux tribe. The Carijoux were promised by contract that the rights of their tribe would be protected but in 1785 they were killed and forced to flee from their homeland after an incident between a settler and a Carijoux ended up in a fight. They were marginalized and most thought that no New-Anglian would heard of them again. But in $YEAR$, Louis-François Carijien, descendant of the Carijoux tribe and respected lawyer decided to try the New-Anglia city for crimes against the rightful owners of the land. The jury ended up legitimizing the acts of the settlers against the tribe, but this was an affair that put the Natives' right in front of the national politics for years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF5.T;Le Sang de Juin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF5.D;Jacques Rosenthal is the most known Lotharian playwriter. Born in France, he had settled in Lotharingia to flee a duel prosecution and had created a big cultural scene in the capital, gathering artists and mecenas from the whole nation. But his latest work has provoked outrage in the devout. His playwright called 'The Blood of June' recalls a love-story between a Catholic woman and a Protestant man during the Anglo-French wars of religion. Mary and Joseph, the lovers of the play, end up separated by their respective families with Joseph being prosecuted by church authorities and condemned to the pyre. The play ends with Mary joining him on the pyre and their respective fathers lamenting on their acts. For Protestant devouts, this play is immoral and instills dangerous values for the youth of Lotharingia. As Rosenthal must face trial for blasphemy and immorality he is ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF7.D;'Great Motherland' was written during the Lotharian war of independence by the young poet Charles Dumas who died soon after being captured by loyalist forces. This poem remained mostly unknown until it was rediscovered by the opera writer Jean-Louis Mazel who put into music and made it the grand moment of his opera 'the rise of the Eagle'. Following the first representations, the song was widely popular and was played in many occasions by the general population. By the end of the XIXth century it had become as popular as the official anthem, the military march 'de l'independance' and would eventually be approved in $YEAR$ as the new anthem of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF8.T;Henri Libre against Manfred Rosedan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF8.D;Henri Libre was one of the countless slaves freed following the abolition of slavery. Born in the plantation of Manfred Rosedan, he was punished for having tried to flee by his master personally with having one of his eyes gouged in public. Later in his life, he lost his left hand while operating the sugar mill. When he was freed, he appeared as a broken man, his corpse showcasing the abuses of slavery. The Negro Integration society decided to help him by putting his former master on trial. This became one of the most known trials of Lotharian society in $YEAR$ as it opened again the wounds of slavery. To add to the national importance of this trial, Rosedan was at the time mayor and soon to be nominated Senator thanks to his contacts in government. Eventually the judge decided that ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF9.D;During the independence war, de Aigle had established the Légion Noire, a military force composed of Black freedmen to fight the Burgundians. A small force, derided by the upper staff, it attracted many unemployed Blacks following the abolition of slavery. The army counted on these units to serve as cannonfodder but they established a reputation for discipline and valor over the years. The 14th Lotharian regiment of the Légion Noire, known popularly as the Black Jaguars was thus the most distinguished Lotharian unit in the XIXth and early XXth century. The Jaguars Noirs ended up as a propaganda source in peace times showcasing the abilities of the Black people and their will to integrate in Lotharian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF10.D;'Notre serment de loyauté à la Lotharie' was a famous pamphlet from the Anglo-Lotharian writer Charlie Oswald that was famously recognized as the cornerstone of Anglo-Lotharian integration. In his book, Oswald claimed that while they shared ties with their Beornian cousins, English people were as much a part of the Lotharian national fabric as Burgundians and that Lotharingia was now their new homeland. he called for his fellow Anglo-Lotharians to integrate even more into society and accept their shared legacy, especially in Odonia. Notably unloved in Beornia, it solidified the split between the Beornians and those they soon called 'Latin Saxons'. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

He is dedicated to right his families wrongdoings with his vast fortune.

AND1.T;The Realm of the Four Parts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND1.D;For four hundred years, the sons of Inti have ruled Tawantinsuyu, Realm of the Four Parts. Our empire once encompassed much of the western spine of the continent called Ameriga by the foreign barbarians, but which our ancestors have known only as home since the dawn of creation. We were not the first to attempt to build a domain here, but we have far exceeded all who preceded us. Guided by our wise Sapa Inca, the son of the Sun, we have resisted the vile Spanish Empire to the north, as well as its bastard sons, the Granadans and Quiteneses, who raided our holy capital decades ago. Some blasphemers whisper that we are cruel, but they are fools - we rule with the firmness which is necessary to survive, without which there would still be nothing but chaos. It is our duty, mandated by the Creator, to render order upon his creation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND1.A;The Sons of Inti shall not perish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND2.T;Death of the Sapa Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND2.D;For over half a decade, the Sapa Inca was busy in the south, putting down a revolt by the insolent Mapuche people. The fighting had been fierce, as the Mapuche are stubborn and inhabit a rough and distant part of the continent. Recently, the royal court learned that the revolt had finally been crushed – but at a terrible cost. As our ruler was leading the assault upon the Mapuche capital, he was ambushed by a group of veteran enemy warriors. Although he fought with ferocity, he was ultimately slain in battle, and did not live to see his favored son, Prince Llapa Yupanki, seize the capital and finally crush the rebellion. Llapa sent an earnest appeal for peace and calm via quipu to the capital as soon as the Sapa Inca died, but already Llapa’s elder brother, Prince Washkar Inka, is beginning to dispute Llapa’s right to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
AND2.A;Who shall inherit the realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.T;Two Princes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.D;Just as we feared, the question of succession between Prince Llapa and Prince Washkar has only grown worse since news of the Sapa Inca’s death became public knowledge. Each man’s strengths and weaknesses are well known. Washkar is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inca, respected by the nobility for avenging the Rape of Cusco and punishing the Granadans, but he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast, Llapa Yupanki, while technically not first in line according to Inca law, was the Sapa Inca’s chosen heir, and is a keen diplomat and administrator, yet his non-confrontational style is disdained by many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inca will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of Tawantinsuyu?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.A;Washkar is the natural heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.B;Llapa was the chosen heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.T;Washkar and the Coricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.D;The Coricancha, the House of the Sun, is the most important temple in all of Tawantinsuyu. Staffed by the Mama-cunas, the temple priestesses, it was once a place of ornate splendor befitting the house of Inti with statues and even interior walls covered in gold. Ravaged by the savage Granadans, it has not yet regained its grandeur but is still a place of reverence. Traditionally, the Sapa Inca is expected to spend a certain amount of their time conducting religious rituals at the Coricancha, leading ceremonies by day and performing sacred astrology by night. Washkar, however, has been neglecting his duties to focus on preparing for the civil war which he is certain is imminent. Now, the Willaq Umu (Recounting Priest, leader of the clergy) and a group of pious panacas (Cuscan priest-nobles), some of the most important men of the realm, have met with Washkar regarding his aloofness. While they hold him in great respect, they are troubled and disquieted by his disregard of his religious duties at the Coricancha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.A;Washkar will set some time aside in the morning and night for rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.B;Chants and stars are nothing compared to the fight for the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.T;The Colla Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.D;When the hated Granadans despoiled sacred Cusco, it was the people of the Titicaca basin which granted the royal court shelter, and from whose people Washkar raised the army which took revenge upon them, even slaughtering their leader, Jose de Herrera. In the time since the atrocity, the region has further grown, matching and perhaps even exceeding the importance of Cuzco itself. Many of the local ayullus (lords), however, come from the Colla people. Though the Colla played a vital role in Washkar’s campaign against the Granadans, they are still looked down upon by the Inca lords, and even the mightiest Colla lord is nothing before the least of the Inca.Yet their support would be quite useful to bolster Washkar’s ranks, and the loyalty of such a centrally located and prosperous region would be a great asset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
AND5.A;For their great service, Waskhar will name many of their lords Inca-by-Privilege. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.B;The Prince is not so desperate as to petition the Colla again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.T;The Time for Battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.D;With most of Washkar Inka’s preparations completed, only a final decision remains to be made. Washkar’s rival, Prince Llapa, is known to be a cautious man, and therefore may take some time before he moves against Washkar. Thus, the elder prince believes that he should take advantage of Llapa’s hesitance to attack as soon as possible, while Llapa is still unready, and crush him before he can consolidate his forces. There is a chance that doing so might color him as a usurper and backstabber in the eyes of the people, especially the lords whose loyalty is still uncertain. It would also be counting on Llapa’s hesitance to merely be the result of indecision, and not him laying some sort of trap for Washkar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.A;We shall wait and plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.B;Courage dictates us to advance and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.T;The Matter of Cavalry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.D;As Prince Washkar and his generals are making their final preparations for the civil war to come, the question of tactics arises. Washkar believes that, in their first engagement with Prince Llapa, he should personally lead a cavalry charge to shatter Llapa’s ranks after they fire their first volley, taking Llapa’s men while they are still reloading their guns and thus vulnerable. The prince asserts that there is no better way to inspire his men to victory than for them to see their leader out in front, blazing a path for the rest of his soldiers to follow. It is true that Washkar is an expert rider and is beloved by the imperial horsemen. This proposal, however, has unnerved his generals, who fear that Washkar could be placing himself in danger by taking such a prominent battlefield role, especially due to rumors of Llapa bringing a large amount of cannons back north from the Mapuche lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Even where their main armies did not clash, the struggle among the polarized aristocracy has riven the empire and dealt a severe blow to its economic and social stability. Though Llapa has finally been coronated Sapa Inca in an ornate ceremony, much of the country still bears deep wounds, and the bitter political animosity which the two brothers’ succession dispute unleashed has been taken as a dark omen.

AND12.D;Prince Llapa does not enjoy the thought of fighting his brother for the throne, but he is determined to save Tawantinsuyu from Prince Washkar’s blood-soaked ambitions. As he prepares his forces for the battles to come, the matter of artillery has arisen. Ever since the Inca were introduced to gunpowder by Chinese merchants, the weapons have completely transformed imperial warfare, even though most of them must be imported from more industrialized nations. Now, Llapa is considering whether to bring cannons back north from his recent campaign alongside his father in the south. As few cannons remain in Cusco, this would give Llapa a decisive advantage over Washkar…that is, if they can be brought north in time, which is uncertain, and which has given Llapa reason to wonder if it might be better to forego them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND13.T;The Altiplano Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND13.D;The Altiplano is a vast place, the heartland of imperial pastoralism, and the home of many rich nobles. Their relationship with Cusco has not always been friendly : the campaign to subjugate their people in centuries past was hard-fought, and the retaliations when they rebelled were brutal. While most in Cusco believe that the grievances of the Altiplano are long forgotten, Prince Llapa knows better. He has heard from several supporters in the area that anger against Prince Washkar and the heavy-handed tradition which he represents could be channeled into allegiance towards Llapa with enough time and resources. We must keep in mind that whatever effort Llapa puts into wooing the Altiplano lords is more effort not spent planning his coming struggle with Washkar. Some have advised Llapa that the nobles of the Altiplano would not want to jeopardize their wealth by siding against Washkar, the man who is supported by many other lords in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND14.D;Among the Aimara people who have risen to prominence since the loss of Chinchaysuyu to the hated Quiteneses, the Lupaca people have felt quite neglected. Still looked down upon as brutish and ignorant by the imperial ruling class, Llapa is aware that many Lupaca are bitter that they as a people do not seem to have advanced in society even as their homelands grow more prosperous. Though the Lupaca have a history of perilous relations with the Inca, revolting on more than one occasion (with brutal consequences), Llapa might be able to secure their support in return for raising them to a higher status once he took the throne. Of course, their aid might not be enough to defeat Washkar, and some of Llapa’s own supporters question if the Lupaca can be trusted at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Born in the Inca nobility, he was tasked during the Mapuche campaign to consolidate the eastern flank of the army, eventually coming to blows with Beornian raiders who allied with some of the Mapuche tribes in what is now Camblesforth. Ambushed by a combined Mapuche and Beornian force in a mountain corridor, he was forced to flee, but still managed to save most of his men by gathering all the infantry armed with bayonet rifles in a square which his enemy’s cavalry was incapable of breaking. Still considered as the main cause for defeat, he was removed from command and sent to exile in his manor. But as the time of battle draws near, he has sent a messenger to Llapa, pledging to serve his cause and helping neuter Washkar’s ferocious cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND20.D;Ever since the monstrous Granadans defiled the holy city of Cusco, the city has been a mere imitation of its former awe-inspiring status. With many ramshackle buildings and barebones temples, it is hardly a fitting capital foran empire such as ours. Thus, the Sapa Inca has begun to undertake a grand campaign of repair and renovation. Roads are being paved and repaved with European techniques, temples are being refurbished, and the whole city is being given a fresh face - with room for expansion Special attention is being paid to the Coricancha, where imperial artisans are painstakingly restoring its beautiful statues of solid gold, as well as the golden layers of the temple interior. With foreign technology mastered and subordinated to our enlightened ways, Cusco shall soon be a truly imperial city once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND21.T;The First Train Line in Tawantinsuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND21.D;Centuries before the coming of the European barbarians, Tawantinsuyu had the finest infrastructure in the western hemisphere, our roads and tampa network giving us unparalleled powers of transportation and communication. Now, however, as technology continues to advance, we too must advance with it. This morning, the first railroad in the empire was finally completed with the assistance of Qingqiunese and Burgundian engineers. The railroad consists of a large loop around the Lake Titicaca basin, connecting its cities together. The Sapa Inca himself hammered in the final, golden nail, in a ceremony well attended by foreign observers. While we currently do not have the capabilities to fully enmesh the nation in the rail network, this still represents a tremendous step forwards in our ability to move people and resources around the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND22.D;Foreigners are not a rare sight in the Empire. Since the gradual opening of ports to the Burgundians and Qingqiunese in the 16th century, the Incas have kept a strict policy on travel in the Empire, but at the same time have sought foreigners to help with their expertise. Qingqiunese bureaucrats teach the Chinese classics to the Inca nobility, Japanese samurai act bodyguards and smiths, and countless European physicians, engineers and mathematicians can be seen in Cuzco and the Imperial ports. Those who choose this life enjoy a good standard of living, but their actions are monitored by their sponsors, with many of those who have disobeyed their contract being put to jail over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND23.D;The Quiteneses, holding our beloved Chinchaysuyu hostage for generations, are an omnipresent reminder of our failures. Since the Spanish carved away the northern quadrant of our empire ages ago, we have been estranged from the peoples who previously enjoyed our protection and generosity. Relations between our two states have always been tense, but matters have lately become even colder. Reports have begun to reach Cusco of Quitenese scouts wandering around the border with suspicious regularity. The region is not well-mapped, but for it to be happening so often gives many in Cusco the distinct suspicion that the Quiteneses are laying the ground for new hostilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND23.A;We will be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND24.T;Tensions in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND24.D;The Incans have never forgotten or forgiven that our nation is built upon lands conquered from them ages ago by the Spanish crown. While the Spanish tried their best to turn the subjugated peoples away from their savage and pagan ways, it is an open secret that this process was never truly complete. Even now, not just in villages but in towns and even cities, men and women still substitute local gods and idols for “God” or “Jesus Christ.” Previously, this has only bothered reactionaries, but now the Inca have been fortifying their border with speed. We have been attempting to map out the new Inca observation posts and supply depots, but the extensive nature of their buildup gives many in Quito the distinct suspicion that the Inca are laying the ground for new hostilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND25.T;The 400th Year of the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND25.D;Four hundred years ago, the ever-glorious Pachacuti came to rule Cusco, and elevated it into the glorious empire of Tawantinsuyu, crushing all rivals before him, and bringing the light of Inti throughout the known world. By his will, the highlands and lowlands were bound into a single realm, and their peoples united under our magnificent dominion. Despite the coming of the European barbarians, Pachacuti’s empire has endured! In the harshest of climates, we remain a mighty empire, without parallel or peer! Against all depredations, we have persevered, as resilient as the mountains over which we live alongside. Now, Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanqui has brought foreign dignitaries from Europe to demonstrate to them the majesty and power of Tawantinsuyu. From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, our domain resounds with fervent praise to Inti and His son, and the foreigners are awed and perhaps even humbled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND25.A;May we surpass Pachacuti and our descendants surpass us in turn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.T;Ending the Purumauca Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.D;Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanqui is well known as a pragmatic and sagacious ruler, but that does not mean he is cowardly or weak. No, he is a believer in conservation of strength, to be expended when necessary. He is also a veteran of the campaigns against the Mapuche of the south, and remembers vividly the pain of watching his father, the former Sapa Inca, perish on the battlefield at the hands of the Mapuche. Llapa knows that the Mapuche are a cancer upon the empire, always bringing it to grief, and the murderers of his father no less! Therefore, he has decided to end their threat forever. Imperial units selected for their fierce loyalty and hatred of the Mapuche have been dispatched south to carve a path of destruction through the Mapuche homeland of Purumauca. Anyone who survives will be driven back north, either to a set of fortified settlements at the edge of Mapuche lands, or dispersed via the mitma system across Cuntinsuyu. These are the last days of Purumauca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.A;They will defy us no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.T;The Chiri Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.D;Sapa Inca Washkar knows that the Mapuche have always been an unruly people, and that they will continue to defy the empire unless something is done. He is also cognizant of his father’s death in battle at their hands, a fact which weighs heavily upon his mind. All the same, he  considers the Mapuche below his attention, given his ambitions. Therefore, he has decided to teach the Mapuche a short, sharp lesson on why their continued obedience is necessary. A military contingent familiar with the lands of Purumauca will head south and shatter the northern Mapuche tribes. Some will be brought to fortified settlements at the northern edge of Purumauca, others dispersed via the mitma system across Cuntinsuyu. A proclamation will then be brought to the southern Mapuche, “confirming” their status as imperial subjects. With such a stern example of the consequences of defiance fresh in their minds, surely they won’t resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.A;We have bigger beasts to slay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND28.T;The Military Reforms of Washkar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND28.D;Ever since the end of the struggle with Prince Llapa, Sapa Inca Washkar has been ruminating on the lessons learned during the battles he fought against his brother. He has concluded that what the Inca army most urgently needs is a formalized command structure, with officers schooled in modern European strategies and tactics. Thus, he has created a new system of military ranks for the army, drafted a new training guide, and has brought Burgundian officers to Tawantinsuyu to assist in the training and reorganizing of the officer corps. While these men will be subject to close surveillance and travel restrictions, like all foreigners, Washkar has placed a great -deal of trust in them. He hopes that this will mark the end of the Inca military as a feudal relic, and the beginning of its transformation into an efficient fighting force. The ayullus are greatly displeased, but most of them have recognized Washkar’s tremendous popularity and resigned themselves to a future without a fully aristocratic army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND29.T;A Beornian Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND29.D;For generations, loyal sons of Beornia have carried out holy crusades against the heathen Inka of the north. Some in Camelot question if armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons attacking the Inka Empire is a wise idea, but they have become something of folk heroes to the citizens of our frontier. Our recent liberation of part of the Inkan frontier a few years ago has only strengthened their resolve. Recently, yet another assault was launched against some Inkan villages near the Beornian border. As far as we can tell, the raiders moved swiftly through the towns with fire and sword, before returning home in triumph. Rumors that Prince Charles, the notorious uncle of King Edward, had led the attack gained the participants even further glory. Though most in Camelot have expressed their approval at the news, some fear that this incident may finally push the Inka over the edge and drive them to seek revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The recent occupation of the southernmost sliver of our realm by Beornia a few years ago has only emboldened them. Recently, yet another mob of unwashed farmers waving rusty blades and antique guns has trespassed into Tawantinsuyu, attacking several frontier villages and even setting a few on fire. Apparently a barbarian lord and relative of their king named Charles led the attack himself!

However, rather than make war upon us, he has offered to partition the mountain range which runs across our domains. His emissaries have made the case that coming to an agreement on the frontier would be far preferable to a clash between our armies to settle the matter. They have appended this statement with a warning that if Beornia rejects this offer, they will “inflict such desolation upon Beornia the likes of which it has never known before.” Shall we cave in to these savages or show them Christian fury?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the Sapa Inca was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside. The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to the barbarian capital of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being.

New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers. However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt.

He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept.\n\nThe Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises alongside the imperial puma banner across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND42.T;Beornia Neutered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND42.D;As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of Tawantinsuyu to surround the barbarian capital of Camelot. Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to the sons of Inti. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current barbarian occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their pathetic nation and their false god, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND42.A;And if they don’t, we have some lovely spikes for them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND43.T;Victory on the Eastern Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND43.D;The imperial armies have returned home in triumph. A series of decisive victories along the frontier forced the Beornians to capitulate and allow us to dictate the new border between our nations. We have taken control of several regions formerly under their control, and mitma resettlement has already begun in the conquered provinces. The current barbarian occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their pathetic nation and their false god, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND43.A;And if they don’t we could always use some more drums.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND44.T;The Conquest of Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND44.D;Washkar said that Beornia would be conquered and she was. He entered Camelot at the head of his army and gave his soldiers one order: “Surpass de Herrera.” The Royal Palace was torched, and the whole Beornian royal family captured and assembled before the Inca. After forcing them to bow and acclaim him as their sovereign, they were then impaled before the smoldering remnants of their city’s cathedral. The corpse of Prince Charles, unofficial perpetrator of the raid that led to the war, was flayed alive publicly, with his skin being fashioned into a war drum, and his skull gilded as Waskhar's personal drinking vessel. Following the conquest, Washkar sent officials throughout his new lands promising them a quiet life if they obeyed the Imperial commandments, reminding them of what awaited any rebel. European merchants have relayed the “Doom of Camelot” with horror, with many people in the Old Continent only now discovering that the city even existed. Now, all Ameriga watches the South with fear, for who knows whom the fury of the Inca will strike next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND44.A;Their false god did not save their king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND45.T;A New Neighbor in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND45.D;Tawantinsuyu, the empire of the Inca, has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians and reduced them to the region of Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent, expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well. Beornian refugees are already fleeing across the border, telling tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca, and now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task, however, so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with Tawantinsuyu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND45.A;Fast stands the watch on the L'Argent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND46.T;The Viceroyalty of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND46.D;In the days of Burgundian colonial rule, Beornia was once merely the southern section of the Viceroyalty of Lotharingia. The English Lotharians sided with the Viceroy during the Lotharian Civil War, and declared independence after the Lotharian patriots prevailed over the loyalists. Now that Beornia has been so radically reduced, Chef de Aigle is considering whether to lay claim to the former extent of Beornia owing to our colonial legacy. Doing so would provide justification for fighting back against the Inca advance and protecting our fellow Euro-Amerigan Protestants (eccentric as they are). As this would be a colossal undertaking in which we would have to assault the mightiest nation in Ameriga, some advocate recognizing the new borders of Beornia and Tawantinsuyu and seeking to avoid conflict with the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND46.A;Beornia was and will be Lotharian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND46.B;Attack the Inca, after what they did to Beornia? Madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND47.T;Lotharingian Claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND47.D;We had hoped that we could spend some time consolidating our new southern lands before we continued our struggle against the foreign barbarians. This was not to be. The preening, pretentious savage of Lotharingia known as “Chef de Aigle” has made an absurd claim to all of former Beornia! His diplomats referenced the former extent of an old Burgundian colony when they tried to explain the situation to us, but our Sapa Inca would not hear it. He replied to them that if Lotharingia sought war with Tawantinsuyu, he “would not keep them waiting,” and our armies have already begun to be mobilized to the frontier. Lotharingia shall be the next barbarian realm to submit to our indomitable strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND47.A;We have neutered the Beornian menace, Lotharians are the same!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND48.T;Victory of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND48.D;Many Lotharians privately doubted whether we could defeat Tawantinsuyu. Once again, Chef Denis de Aigle proved his doubters wrong and brought Lotharingia glory. The Inca armies were totally shattered, and their Sapa Inca was forced to surrender all his southern conquests. With this overwhelming triumph, de Aigle has enough popular support to organize a constitutional convention. This will ground Lotharingia on solid legal foundations and enshrine his legacy as the greatest Lotharian of all time! The only question is what form of government Lotharingia shall assume. There has been profound pressure from the Atlanteans to restore power to the people. A growing number of Lotharians would prefer a republican federation to accommodate our new lands, but there is an alternative : crown de Aigle as King Denis I! Being a parliamentary monarch would reduce de Aigle to a mostly symbolic role, but it would prevent the Atlanteans from removing him entirely, and even the weakest monarch has ways to influence a nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND48.A;A republican federation will bring liberty to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND48.B;Vive le Roi de Lotharingie, Denis I de Aigle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND49.T;An Offer from Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND49.D;Lotharingia has broken the satanic Inkans and driven them back into their desolate mountains. Yet the brutality which they have wreaked upon the Beornian countryside – and the fact that Lotharingia is now making much hay of its status as the “rightful heirs” of the old Burgundian Viceroyalty – makes the restoration of our nation seem unlikely. A proposal has instead been extended by the Lotharian government for us to join their nation as its newest state. Given their newfound hegemony in southern Ameriga, and their status as European-descended co-religionists, perhaps we could find some common ground?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND49.A;“Thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND50.T;Annexation of the Beornian Remnant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND50.D;Now that we have laid claim to the full extent of the Burgundian Viceroyalty and taken control of Beornia’s old lands, there is the matter of the Beornian remnant. Reduced to Avalon and on the verge of collapse due to refugee overpopulation and lack of farmlands and food, it is unthinkable that such a nation could possibly survive on its own. Furthermore, as all of Beornia is naturally Lotharian land, they belong within our nation. Thankfully, they have seen our side of the matter, and have petitioned for annexation into our glorious country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND50.A;All’s well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND51.T;Victory of De Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND51.D;Many Lotharians privately doubted whether we could defeat Tawantinsuyu. Once again, Chef Denis de Aigle proved his doubters wrong and brought Lotharingia glory. The Inca armies were totally shattered and the Sapa Inca was forced to surrender all his southern conquests. With this overwhelming triumph, de Aigle now has sufficient popular support to reshape the government in his image. While he could continue his benevolent rule, it might be prudent to take this opportunity to set Lotharingia on steadier legal footing. The people would no doubt be grateful if de Aigle was generous enough to create a constitution and call for new elections, inaugurating a democratic era. This might mean the end of his rule, however, which leaves de Aigle with a more attractive option : Crown himself as King Denis I! By becoming a monarch, and drafting a royal charter to grant some basic rights to the people, de Aigle will elevate himself from a politician to a figure of nobility, splendor, and grandeur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND51.A;Vive le Roi de Lotharingie, Denis I de Aigle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND51.B;The people rejoice at Le Chef’s victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND51.C;No better time to go out on a high note.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND52.T;Peace on the Odon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND52.D;Despite the best efforts of the Lotharian army, we have been unable to drive out the Inca from the Beornian plains, though they have similarly failed to make substantial gains in Lotharingia. Thus, Le Chef and the Sapa Inca have signed a peace treaty restoring the previous borders of their respective nations. We are without a doubt the worse off, as our attempts to claim Beornia have been thwarted. In exchange for declining to press for any territorial gains from us, the Sapa Inca demanded that we drop all claims to the former southern extent of the Viceroyalty of Lotharingia. De Aigle’s public failure has amplified the voices of his critics, and his rule seems destined to grow even more unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND52.A;At least the Inca didn’t make further gains…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND53.T;Treaty of Grande Rivière;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND53.D;The wrath of the Inca has fallen upon a new victim. With the Lotharian army destroyed in the field, the Sapa Inca reached the gates of the capital and threatened to scour the city unless we signed a harsh and bitter peace. The resulting treaty has dismembered Lotharingia. Multiple regions have been given independence, and vast swaths of western territory have been annexed by Tawantinsuyu. This is worse than a failure – this is a catastrophe, and it has de Aigle’s name written all over it. Only he, his critics say, could have conceived of a plan so foolhardy as to seek to conquer all the former Beornia by attacking the Inca head-on. Those who remain within Lotharingia are beside themselves with fury at the man whose vanity and ambition led him to provoke such a ruinous war with the Inca. As the Inca march onwards, the future of Le Chef is bleak. People have poured out into the streets in protest, calling not merely for his resignation, but for his arrest and trial for treason, for his execution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND53.A;C’est la vie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND54.T;Victory in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND54.D;The invincible strength of Tawantinsuyu has been confirmed once more. The impudent Lotharians thought that they could challenge our imperial might, and we have punished them for their arrogance. Their nation has been dismantled, and its western lands claimed by us. Already the new territories are being prepared for mitma resettlement. There will likely be continued resistance from those who do not yet comprehend the glory of Inti and the Sapa Inca but all will learn obedience in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND54.A;“Lotharian Beornia,” what a ridiculous notion…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND55.T;Aftermath of the Beornian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND55.D;In the last few years, our nation’s reputation has grown. The steady increase of our cultural, economic, and military influence has brought us to international attention, culminating in our recent war. Our victory over Beornia has been especially shocking to the foreign barbarians, who were astounded to learn that a nation with “modern” weaponry and European blood was beaten and humiliated by a native empire. These foreign barbarians, who once spoke of us as “pagan hordes” and “savage primitives,” now refer to us with, if not respect, then certainly a newfound circumspection. While certain powers such as Spain have withheld recognition of us out of spite, others, such as Burgundy, have elevated their presence within Cusco to diplomatic offices befitting communication with an equal international partner. Tawantinsuyu has arrived at modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND55.A;And soon, Inti’s light shall illuminate all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND560.T;The Northern Barbarians Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND560.D;The savages of the north, the same people who desecrated sacred Cusco years ago, have once again return to carry fire and sword into our land. This is especially unfortunate given that we are already occupied with punishing the Beornian savages in the southeast. While surrender is unthinkable, it may be necessary for the sake of the empire to sign a peace treaty with the Beornians in order to focus our full wrath upon the northern barbarians. After all, their chief does not seek the total destruction of Tawantinsuyu, while the same cannot be said for the northern savages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND560.A;We will be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND560.B;There will be peace only when our armies are marching through Camelot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND56.T;The Andine War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND56.D;Decades ago, Ballivian descended upon Cusco alongside two of the finest men he has ever known : Jose de Herrera and Guillermo de Blanco. They found untold riches in the Inca capital, but the Inca inflicted a brutal revenge, killing de Herrera and rampaging all the way to Chan Chan. Ever since that day, Ballivian has been planning his revenge against the Inca. He knows that so long as they are strong, Quito will never be secure, and Ameriga will never be safe. Thus, he has now decided to slaughter the Inca puma once and for all! The coming war shall determine the fate of western Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND56.A;This time we will not leave even Cusco’s foundations standing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.T;The Andine War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.D;Decades ago, three barbarian warlords transgressed upon the sacred city of Cusco and inflicted horrid blasphemies upon it. Washkar Inca led a campaign of righteous retribution against them, killing their leader and marching all the way to Chan Chan. But if the Quitenese savages thought that time would lessen our grief or dull our memories of those agonizing days, they thought wrong! We have neither forgotten nor forgiven their atrocities. Now, Tawantinsuyu is strong and proud, whereas Quito has recently been convulsed by political turmoil. The time has come to finish what we started so many years ago and wipe Quito from the map! Chinchaysuyu shall be liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.A;The puma shall devour the eagle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.T;The Treaty of Arequipa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.D;For the second time this century, we have been humiliated by the Quiteneses. The imperial armies were bested in the very mountains and valleys of our ancestors, and the foreign savages surged south. Imperial rule collapsed under the weight of the fiasco, the Sapa Inca vanishing during riots which convulsed the capital. In the aftermath, Ballivian reorganized Tawantinsuyu. Vast swaths of the empire have been pried away by barbarians, while a new and brutal system has arisen within. Highland groups with historical grievances against the Inca have been made lords of the region with Quitenese overseers. Meanwhile, the lowlands are being set aside for Quitenese resettlement. The Quiteneses are now speaking of the mita system in ways which imply the ownership of resettled peoples by their local governor, and a puppet Sapa Inca has been installed by Ballivian. Every aspect of the empire is being appropriated by Euro-Amerigan colonialism. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is an empire no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.A;The sons of Inti have perished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.T;The Treaty of Arequipa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.D;Our total victory over the southern savages has at last been secured. It seems that their ruler was lost in the chaos of riots which gripped their capital when news of our impending victory leaked out. We have thus taken this opportunity to reorganize the Inca state to suit our interests. Natives with historical grievances against the Inca have been appointed as overseers of the highlands, while the lowlands are being cleared out for settlement by civilized peoples. Our jurists are already drawing up a new Tawantinsuyu “charter” which will codify the old customs of the Inca in ways which serve Quito. Of particular interest is the mita system of labor, which should give our colonial administrators and new landlords an excellent way of keeping their lands productive and putting those brutes to work. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is now merely our trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.A;And civilization – unforgiving as it is – has finally come to the Andes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.T;The War in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.D;Ever since de Herrera, de Blanco, and Ballivian led their attack on the Inca city of Cusco, tensions between our two nations have been high. The Inca dismissed the very existence of Quito, claiming that it was “erected upon the foundations of Chinchaysuyu” and demanding our “return” to their empire. Meanwhile, the increasing numbers of immigrants and settlers to our country gives us cause to seek expansion into the Inca lands. There is growing sentiment that the time has come for a decisive clash to settle the matter of which of our two nations is the master of the Andes. If we hesitate, jingoists say, then the wicked Inca will surely strike the first blow. The consequence of failure, however, is likely to be the destruction of Quito, so we must weigh our options carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.A;To dominate the Andes is our manifest destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.B;No, the time is not yet right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND61.T;Convocation of the Knights;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND61.D;Ever since the Inca conquest of Beornia, an increasing number of Beornian refugees have arrived in Nouvelle Amsterdam. They bring tales of the horrid brutality and endless malevolence of the Inca, speaking of their ruler, Sapa Inca Washkar, in terms of absolute evil. Up until now, their presence in Nouvelle Amsterdam has merely altered the local economy (and resulted in Beornians attempting to shut down local bars and brothels on grounds of morality), but now a curious new group has formed. Referring to themselves as the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Albion, they combine the functions of a benevolent society with a political pressure group – and a paramilitary. They provide charitable aid to Beornians in the area, but also demand a hard line against Tawantinsuyu and even train their members in “the sacred rite of combat,” for “the coming crusade.” Some see them as a nuisance, but after the annihilation of Camelot, others in Nouvelle Amsterdam are beginning to consider their paranoia justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND61.A;Arise, new knights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND62.T;The Grand Rivière Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND62.D;The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu’s expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inca Washkar, they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Inca aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inka Empire.” Invitations are going out across southern Ameriga, and even Spain and Scandinavia, two powers with tangible Amerigan interests, are expected to send delegates. This could be the beginning of the greatest war that Ameriga has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND67.D;Sapa Inca Washkar’s efforts to advance the glory of Tawantinsuyu have at last incurred the wrath of the international community. Rumors abound among the foreigners within Cusco that some type of diplomatic meeting is being convened in Lotharingia, where representatives of many nations with grudges against the empire will be in attendance. It seems clear that such a meeting can only be for the planning of a war, unprecedented in scale and scope, against us. As Washkar delves deeper into war planning, all of Tawantinsuyu tenses, like a single muscle ready to spring into action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND68.T;The Grand Rivière Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND68.D;Representatives from across Ameriga and Europe convened in Grand Rivière recently to discuss the threat posed by Tawantinsuyu. All powers in attendance agreed that the continued rule of Sapa Inca Washkar, and the occupation of surrounding lands by the Inca, could no longer be tolerated. The Knights of Albion and the Lotharian representatives made impassioned speeches on the insatiable megalomania of Washkar, and the aspirations of Tawantinsuyu for nothing less than total domination of Ameriga. The conference concluded with a joint agreement by the attending powers that they would work in concert and coordinate their forces against the Inca, and issued a declaration of the necessity of the Inca to withdraw from their conquests.

Thus the Powers are determined to act promptly and unanimously, with the forces necessary for realizing this goal.” – Declaration of Grand Rivière \n \n Since the first clash between the Inca and the Spanish Empires, Tawantinsuyu has struggled against the foreigners. Now the newest chapter in that struggle is about to be written with the blood of thousands of Amerigans. An international coalition has assembled to dismantle the realm of Sapa Inca Washkar, while he seeks to make himself master of the continent.

AND70.T;The Second Sack of Cusco;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND70.D;Once again, foreign armies have despoiled the sacred heart of Tawantinsuyu. Having seized control of the city of Cusco, $FROMCOUNTRY$ armies had free reign of the area, their commanders allowing them to run wild. The result was a cavalcade of rapine and slaughter, with soldiers chiseling gold and silver from the walls of temples and royal palaces, and the most savage atrocities playing out in street after street, men and women subjected to unspeakable acts. Even the House of the Sun was not spared, its golden statues, painstakingly restored by imperial artisans, once again cast down and dismembered. Worst of all was the fate of the royal palace, completely plundered by the foreigners, before, by accident or wicked plan, a fire was started which burned the whole building down. The devastation of Cusco for the second time in decades has spread despair across the empire and augurs ill for our chances of victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND71.D;The Inca seizure of Fort Lothère has seen a series of atrocities play out, the likes of which surpass even the darkest days of the Lotharingian Civil War. Inca forces, tired and ill-tempered for having marched all the way to the Atlantic coast, were given free reign of the city by Sapa Inca Washkar. The result was a cavalcade of rapine and slaughter, with Inca soldiers toppling statues of de Aigle and carting away their remains, and inflicting acts upon the Lotharians too horrid to speak of. Even the presidential palace was not spared, completely pillaged by Inca soldiers before, by accident or vile plan, a fire was started which burned the whole building down. The unprecedented devastation of Fort Lothère has spread despair across the nation and bodes ill for our chances of victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND72.T;The Coalition Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND72.D;Hundreds of years ago, Sapa Inca Pachacuti enlightened his people by teaching them of Inti and how best to give praise to the sun. Now, their descendants, like Icarus of Greek myth, have flown too close to the sun, and been sent plunging into the abyss below. The armies of the coalition defeated the Inca armies after a series of maneuvers along the frontier allowed them entry into the imperial heartlands. Sapa Inca Washkar was cornered by the Coalition armies near Lake Titicaca and perished while leading the final charge against them. After a relative of Washkar was hurriedly coronated as the new Sapa Inca, he was made to sign an exorbitant and punitive peace treaty. Tawantinsuyu has been dismembered, and surrounding nations have stripped away imperial lands. The Inca lands which remain have been devastated by war, their people embittered and traumatized by the tyrant who brought so much suffering to their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND72.A;The sons of Inti have perished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND73.T;The Peace of Hullaqa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND73.D;Despite the best efforts of the foreign hordes, they have been unable to destroy our glorious empire. Yet we, too, have been unable to truly crush our enemies. Thus, as a gesture of his magnanimity, Sapa Inca Washkar has summoned representatives from the enemy coalition to a peace conference in Hullaqa. The effort was less of a serious negotiation and more a gesture of his power : nobody had any illusions that Washkar would surrender his gains. The resulting treaty confirmed the borders of Ameriga as they existed prior to the war. The Lotharian delegates were especially morose at this news, realizing that their western lands were now permanently out of their reach, but the other powers decided that securing peace was more important. While Washkar is privately disappointed that the chance to remake the continent in his image has been lost, he does not show it : publicly, he is exultant in the Inca’s victory over the powers of the Old and New Worlds in the face of overwhelming odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

In battles across Ameriga, the armies of the coalition were shattered by the Inca forces. An armistice has been declared before the final peace terms are handed down to us by Sapa Inca Washkar, but already Incan forces have occupied the western lands of our nation. Meanwhile, with the Lotharian military broken and the nation grinding under the burden of wartime devastation, multiple regions have seceded entirely. New Alsace, Atlantia, and Odonia have all declared independence, with the explicit support of Tawantinsuyu.

In battles across Ameriga, the armies of the coalition were shattered by the Inca forces. An armistice has been declared before the final peace terms are handed down to us by Sapa Inca Washkar, but already multiple regions have seceded with Inca support, denouncing the Planteurs for bringing national ruination.

AND76.T;The Apogee of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND76.D;“There must be war and victory over the enemy in the afterlife, for otherwise it would be devoid of pleasure.” – Sapa Inca Washkar\n\n400 years ago, Sapa Inca Pachacuti ascended to the throne Cusco, and thus our empire was born. Now, our journey to greatness has been completed by the only man to surpass him : Sapa Inca Washkar, the Terror of the East. After crushing the coalition, its leaders were summoned to Cusco. Washkar greeted them in full imperial regalia, then led them into the royal palace and brought them before a massive map of Ameriga. There they learned of their places within the new order in the continent - HIS continent - which Washkar had already drawn out. The Amerigans were then brought to the House of the Sun, where they all swore fealty to the Sapa Inca. As the imperial banners are raised across the continent, the darkness brought by the European conquistadors is finally receding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND76.A;And just as we vowed, the blazing rays of Inti illuminate all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
AND77.T;The Purification of Chinchaysuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND77.D;Now that the Realm of the Four Parts once again lives up to its name, we must prevent any possibility of resistance which might allow foreigners to pry Chinchaysuyu away again. All Quitenese and Chimu soldiers and officers will, without exception, be executed. Their knowledge and skills make them too dangerous to be allowed to live, not to mention that they are the most blatant manifestation of the system of conquest which Spain and its inheritors imposed upon Chinchaysuyu. To avoid inspiring their relatives to take revenge, their direct families will also be executed. In addition, the local royal authorities and non-European peoples of the area will be given a relatively free hand to…settle disputes against the foreigners. Combined with a total withholding of all forms of government aid, assistance, or support from them, we should soon be rid of their infection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND77.A;This is sacred work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.T;The End of the Potosi Silver Mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.D;For centuries, Potosi has bestowed the bounty of its silver upon imperial miners. That abundance of wealth has kept our crafters and artisans able to construct beautiful and precious works, to say nothing of its boon to our treasury. Yet while $GET_ADJ$ silversmithing may be well regarded abroad, its fortunes have just gotten dimmer. The latest report from the Potosi engineers shows that outputs from the silver mines have plummeted over the last several years. While a few optimistic geologists continue searching for new veins - the most pious of them making entreaties to Supay, the god of the underworld and a frequent recipient of miners’ prayers - it seems that Potosi’s miners must now turn to more mundane metals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.A;Supay gives and Supay takes away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND78.T;Runaqelqasqa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND78.D;Since its founding, Tawantinsuyu has not possessed an alphabet. Quipus, knotted cords used to record data such as tax records, history, messages, and census information, have served us well but are tedious to reproduce. The coming of traders from China, Qingqiu, Japan, and Burgundy caused rudimentary phonetic languages using various symbols to be developed for mercantile purposes. Now a team of imperial amautas (scholars) and European and Japanese linguists led by Llapa have completed a new treatise, “The One Script of Humanity.” It has refined the Runasimi dialects of the imperial lingua franca into one featural alphabet with logographic elements, dubbed Runaqelqasa (“human script”). Inspired by East Asian, Latin, and Arabic languages (especially Korean), it is written in symbols organized into syllable blocks, with numbers represented as groups of dotted lines akin to quipu. Already, new imperial scribes are transcribing quipu into written records. A revolution in imperial literature and education is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND78.A;A language fit for the sons of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND79.T;The Second Industrial Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND79.D;The direction of the imperial court in the economy is an old tradition, even if its actual methods differ from those commonly employed in Europe and Asia. As our technology improves, however, the old systems of mit’a (mandatory public service) and mink’a (local communal work) are no longer sufficient to fulfill our economic objectives. Thus, drawing on foreign techniques and ideas of economic development and state-controlled economics, the imperial court has drawn up a new iteration of an industrialization plan. The “Second Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Realm of the Four Parts,” or simply the “Second Industrial Plan,” calls for the expansion of manufacturing within the empire. It allocates funds for the modernization of farming and mining, as well as grant programs for factory construction. Combined with the Sapa Inca’s industrial advisors from Qingqiu and Burgundy, this will accelerate Tawantinsuyu’s economy into modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND79.A;The plan is law, its fulfillment is duty, and over-fulfillment is honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.T;Emperor of the Socialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.D;One of the Sapa Inca Llapa’s many titles is, “Lover and Benefactor of the Poor.” This has gained new relevance with the growth of socialist movements within Tawantinsuyu. While they have been thoroughly suppressed, Llapa realizes that ending the long-term socialist threat requires absorbing their power base. Thus, he has sought to co-opt the more moderate socialist tendencies to deter republicanism. Working with the rest of the royal court, a new law has been made to introduce paternalistic welfare to Tawantinsuyu. The “Beneficence Act” includes the curtailment of child labor, the strengthening of national health care and hospital funding, and a pension fund for elderly citizens. In a first for our empire, factory workers will be allowed to elect their own managers! The Sapa Inca’s actions have earned him a new popular title : Emperor of the Socialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.A;A socialist subject of the empire is still a subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.T;The Great Reorganization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.D;Sapa Inca Llapa and his advisors have concluded that Tawantinsuyu has grown too large for the old system of rule to continue. The concentration of power and authority in Cusco will not suffice if the empire is to continue to expand. Therefore, he has decided to gather the most learned scholars in the realm and draft a proclamation radically redefining domestic governance. Henceforth, each suyu (part) will have an appointed Inca governor with broad internal powers. Beneath them, provincial governorships will consist of meritocratic Inca selection. The advent of a written language for Tawantinsuyu has allowed Sapa Inca Llapa and his advisors to publish and rapidly distribute this new document.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.A;All parts equal under Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.T;Selecting an Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.D;As Sapa Inca Llapa grows older, he has come to realize that he must make plans for his succession. Remembering his succession struggle with his brother, Washkar Inca, and having no desire to inflict such things upon his children, Llapa intends to make his choice of heir known and clear. Though Llapa loves his daughters as much as his sons, a female ruler is unthinkable, and so it is his three sons among whom he must choose. The youngest, Sunquyuq Inca, known as “Hurhi” (“George” in the barbarian Beornian tongue), is the governor of the former Beornian lands. He has studied the Beornians and the Europeans and is seen by the former as a decent man, rare among Inca. The oldest, Llipya Sinchiyachiq Inca, governor of Chinchaysuyu, has collaborated with the Sapa Inca on his legislation and is the strongest advocate of Llapa’s “Inca reformism.” The middle son, Sinchi Churan Inca, governor of Collaysuyu, is beloved for aiding the lower class while also being committed to industrial development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.A;Hurhi Sunquyuq Inca knows how to handle the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.B;Llipya Sinchiyachiq Inca understands Llapa’s vision the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.C;Sinchi Churan Inca shall build the most stable and reformed society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND83.T;The Travels of Llapa Yupanki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND83.D;With his reform program in place, and the succession settled, Sapa Inca Llapa can finally fulfill his long-held desire to travel the world! While he is gone, his sacred wawqi “brother,” a golden statue representing the other half of his camaquen (life force), will act in his place as ruler of the empire. Though he is particularly interested in touring the great cities and geographic marvels of Europe, he also intends to visit Qingqiu and Japan. At the top of his list of European nations to visit is Burgundy, who has for centuries been Tawantinsuyu’s most important European economic and cultural contact. Llapa has been particularly impressed with news of the exploits of the notorious Jean de Bouillon. Along the way, he will also meet with officials from said governments and furnish Tawantinsuyu’s international image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND83.A;Off we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.D;Sapa Inca Llapa has taken Europe by storm – in terms of popularity, that is. Crowds have gathered in Anvers, Prague, Paris, and all the other great cities of the continent, to behold the legendary Sapa Inca and his royal entourage. European savages may be easily impressed, but the tremendous attention which Llapa and his officials have drawn during their travels surprised even themselves. Whether riding a gondola in Venice, touring the fabulous gardens of Anvers, or cutting a sharp figure near St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, the Sapa Inca has caused more than a few Europeans to reevaluate their views on Tawantinsuyu and the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.A;They were starstruck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND85.T;The Emperor and the King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND85.D;It was in Anvers that Llapa met the man he’d most looked forward to meeting during his time in Europe: King Jean de Bouillon of Burgundy. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Jean is perhaps the only European which Llapa sees as remotely comparable to himself. Both Jean and the emperor’s Inca officials were astounded when Llapa – having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit – not only greeted him in flawless Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in that barbarian tongue! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Tawantinsuyu and Burgundy, and their distaste for Catholics. The Sapa Inca’s knowledge of astronomy particularly impressed the Burgundian king. Jean then accompanied the Sapa Inca on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND86.D;Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanki of Tawantinsuyu (the Inca Empire) has recently been touring Europe, turning heads and drawing crowds across the continent. Anvers, however, held special significance to him, due to his acquaintance with King Jean. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Llapa is perhaps the only non-European monarch whom Jean sees as remotely comparable to himself. Both Jean and the emperor’s Inca officials were astounded when Llapa – having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit – not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in it! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Burgundy and Tawantinsuyu, and their distaste for Catholics.

AND87.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND87.D;Out of all the nations of Asia, Japan has captured Sapa Inca Llapa’s attention the most. Enthralled by its culture and language, as well as the industrious capacity of its people, Llapa was eager to see the land so often spoken of by the Japanese bodyguards and royal artisans of Cusco. The Land of the Rising Sun did not disappoint. While European technology and culture have made a limited mark upon Japan, it is still very much steeped in tradition and the ways of the past – much to Llapa’s excitement. Stunning the Japanese with his superb command of their language, the emperor and his entourage took in the marvelous cities and natural landmarks of Japan with wonder. The imperial capital of Kyoto – where the Sapa Inca was received by the Japanese Emperor – was the grandest of all, the beauty of its temples and palaces rendering the Sapa Inca speechless multiple times. The Sapa Inca attended kabuki theater and even received a geisha performance, who have begun to make a resurgence in a Japan which is simultaneously old and new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND88.D;Out of all the nations of Asia, Japan has captured Sapa Inca Llapa’s attention the most. Enthralled by its culture and language, as well as the industrious capacity of its people, Llapa was eager to see the land so often spoken of by the Japanese bodyguards and royal artisans of Cusco. The Land of the Rising Sun was not quite what he expected. European technology and culture have triggered transformations across Japanese society – much to Llapa’s surprise. Though his deft command of Japanese impressed his hosts, and the grandeur of Japan’s cities and natural landmarks was impressive, the Sapa Inca was perturbed to find Japan so different from how he had imagined it. Even touring Kyoto, the ancient imperial capital, and being received by the Japanese Emperor did not shake Llapa from his disillusionment. In fact, when the Tenno met Llapa in a distinctly European-inspired ceremonial uniform, the Sapa Inca almost gasped in shock. All told, the visit was not as he had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND88.A;At least the geisha lived up to his expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.T;An Inca Visitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.D;Over the past few days, the people of Japan have witnessed something extraordinary : the first ever visit by an Inca Emperor! Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanki of Tawantinsuyu, as part of his diplomatic tour across Europe and the Pacific, recently concluded his visit to our empire. The Sapa Inca surprised many with his good command of Japanese, though his excited fascination with Japanese art and culture was quite unconcealed. His reception in the imperial capital by the Emperor was particularly noteworthy, a splendid ceremony befitting the emperor of the east, the ruler of the only native realm to successfully resist the European onslaught. Tawantinsuyu has long been a fixture in Japanese diplomatic and economic interchange, and this latest episode will only strengthen those bonds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.A;He seemed a little too interested in the geishas’ performance, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.D;Next to Burgundy and Japan, Qingqiu is the most influential nation in Tawantinsuyu. For centuries, Qingqiuan merchants have plied the coast, and Qingqiuan scholars have educated ayullus and their children, teaching them literature, science, and philosophy. Tawantinsuyu boasts some of the greatest Confucianists outside of the Chinese sphere. More recently, Qingqiuan engineers have assisted in developing imperial industry and infrastructure. Thus, it was only natural that Qingqiu would be the final stop of the Sapa Inca’s international tour. The nation was wooed by the Sapa Inca, being oddly reminiscent of both China and Tawantinsuyu yet distinctively its own. Llapa’s Sanbaoese, while limited, nevertheless surprised his hosts - he was delighted to meet a small group of men who identified themselves as the University of Sanbao’s Tawantinsuyu scholars! After being received by the Qingqiuan head of state, the Sapa Inca spent his final evening taking in a night of traditional Chinese dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.A;A marvelous conclusion of a marvelous journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.T;The Return of the Sapa Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.D;After over two months abroad, Sapa Inca Llapa has finally returned home to Tawantinsuyu. He was received in a magnificent ceremony, with him and the royal family traveling on a special train from the port city of Uraycusta all the way back to Cusco. The experience has humbled the Sapa Inca, giving him insights on the nations of the world and challenging his conceptions of their peoples. Moreover, the cultural exposure which his court officials received in places such as Burgundy, Japan, and Qingqiu will only continue to influence the ayullus and by proxy the nation at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.A;Today, the world has grown smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND92.D;Since the discovery of the South Pole, our geographers and scientists have repeatedly expressed the value of establishing a claim to some section of Antarctica. Now, a new law has been passed to formally demarcate Lastahallpa, the “Land of Snow,” Tawantinsuyu’s newest southern territory. While the value of the land itself is little beyond national prestige and scientific data gathering, the expansion of the Realm of the Four Parts to yet another continent is nevertheless a significant milestone in our national history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND94.T;The Death of Llapa Yupanqi Inca;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AND94.D;The Sapa Inca’s health had been declining for the last decade. The stress of rulership, along with his insistence on continuing his travels, strained his body greatly. During his last years, Llapa and his imperial biographer held regular sessions where, through dictation and interview, the Sapa Inca composed his final review of his own life. Though Llapa expressed satisfaction at having modernized Tawantinsuyu, he also regretted what he felt was the uncertainty of the empire’s place in Ameriga. He even pondered if his brother, Washkar Inca, may have been a better choice for the throne. Last evening, while dictating the final chapter regarding his thoughts on the future of the empire, Llapa suddenly demanded to be brought onto the palace terrace. In their haste, his attendants did not realize that he was in the beginning of a massive stroke. The Sapa Inca of modernity expired while watching the sun set over the mountains, his wistfulness concealing any trace of pain.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AND950.D;The Sapa Inca had fought to keep healthy over the last decade. The stress of rulership and his travels was great, but his will greater. During his last years, Llapa and his imperial biographer held regular sessions where, through dictation and interview, the Sapa Inca composed his final review of his own life. Llapa expressed satisfaction at having modernized the empire and taken leadership of Ameriga, but more importantly, in having cultivated an educated people who could inherit the prosperous realm which he built. Llapa declared his memoirs finished last evening and went to sleep early. This morning it was discovered that he was not in his bed, and palace attendants searched the grounds. The Sapa Inca of modernity was found expired on the palace terrace, having awoken early and watched the sun rise over the mountains, his face an image of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The participants gathered in the Awkaypata, the central plaza, along with statues of Inti and other major gods and wak’a. Thousands of llamas along with elegant garments, jewelry, and idols, were assembled. The priests made sacrifices to each of the shrines in Cusco and designated materials for sacrifice in each major shrine of the Four Corners. Their most important offerings were dedicated to the Creator God Wiraqocha, whose aid was solicited in granting the emperor great health, victory in battle, many children, and peace in his time. The llamas were solemnly sacrificed and cremated along with the cloth, and the artifacts buried on Chuquicancha hill. Sunquyuq “Hurhi” Inca is expected to be a diplomatic ruler, his time governing the southeast giving him insight into the ways of barbarians. Some wonder if he may be too sympathetic to foreigners but for now all the realm honors their new ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently we are still organizing the territory, but as it was formerly a prime source of mineral wealth for the Inca, we have no doubt that it shall become a productive part of our own empire. The only question now is whether we should delegate a local administration to govern the region or impose direct rule.

AND101.D;Quito was ravaged by the Incas, to the point that most of its old political structure is in tatters – to be honest, most of the nation itself is in tatters. Therefore, rather than restore a broken and crippled country, we have taken it upon ourselves to rebuild Quito as a prosperous part of New Granada. The work will not be easy, nor will it be swift, but Hispanic Ameriga has been unified at last. In time, we shall restore it to its former prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.” – John 11 : 43 – 44\n\nNo country has suffered as much at the hands of the Inkans as Beornia. Like Job, we endured countless agonies, each more painful than the last. Yet just as God rewarded Job for his resilience, so too have we been rewarded. The Treaty of Quito has reestablished Beornia, and the wounds inflicted upon us by the Inkans no longer weep. Never again will we be made to kneel before the savage heathens!

Despite our conquest of the region, would-be English immigrants have continued to attempt to migrate to its remnants. Apparently there was some sort of revolt in their homeland which drove them to leave. Their information on the former Beornia was rather lacking : the English seemed to have expected a mythical tropical paradise, rather than the smoldering remains of an insignificant barbarian realm of superstitious cowherds. Yet the English, for reasons known only to their demented minds, have still attempted to immigrate to its former lands. This will no longer be tolerated. At this very moment, imperial forces are already on their way to evict the English settlers and send them away from Tawantinsuyu at the first possible opportunity. We will not slaughter them - we are not savages like the Beornians - but they and their primitive, brutish ways cannot remain here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem has not simply been a lack of will to restore it. Cusco was constructed over a period of centuries with each generation adding new elements. Rebuilding the city, especially to its prior levels of splendor, is an undertaking requiring substantial resources including significant amounts of precious metals. Now, however, the necessity of restoring the city – and the advancement of our mining and processing technology – has overcome the daunting nature of the task. Not only will the city be restored, but it will also be modernized with architectural and engineering knowledge gleaned from the foreigners.

He sees it in his nightmares, hears the sounds of the chaos whenever he is alone for too long. There is only one way to quiet the ghosts of the past : destroy Cisandina as the Spanish call the region of Kitu! For generations, the northern savages have oppressed our imperial brethren in Chinchaysuyu. The Realm of the Four Parts must become whole once again, and that means annihilating the illegitimate state of Quito.

As Tawantinsuyu does not and has never recognized Quito as a legitimate nation, we will not be making any sort of peace treaty with them. We shall instead simply proclaim our annexation of the territory, the ending of the “insurrection,” and the reunification of Chinchaysuyu.

industrialization_chile_desc;Our geologists and engineers have identified Collasuyu as ideally suited for industrial expansion. It possesses several valuable ores, as well as materials suited for the manufacture of gunpowder. If we were to focus the mitma system on bringing labor to the region, as well as financial assistance for the creation of new towns and the construction of factories, then it should not be difficult to build Collasuyu into a new manufacturing hub of Tawantinsuyu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

mechanizing_potosi_desc;For centuries, the Potosi mines have provided our empire with more silver than we could ever dream of. Its bountiful veins have furnished ayullus and royal artisans for generations, and Inca silver is regarded even abroad as a safe and dependable currency. However, our extraction process in the region is still reliant upon manual labor and other techniques which are now outdated. New advances in mining and transportation technology, both those imported from Qingqiu and Burgundy and those created by our own scientists, could vastly expand mining in Potosi. By focusing the mitma system on bringing new miners and building local communities in Potosi, we shall ensure that we have the labor required for such an endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Soon, the sound of their pututu and the accompanying sight of their black mantle will bring fear in the hearts of the seditious - for if they don't repent, they will be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Imperial_Identity_title;Promote an Imperial Identity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
imperial_identity_desc;For centuries, Tawantinsuyu has encompassed a dizzying array of peoples and languages. In this modern era of centralized nation-states, however, it is necessary to bind the empire together in a more decisive manner. The amautas (scholars) of the royal court have now proposed that we coordinate the national education program, and cultural institutions, towards the establishment of a new identity. This so-called “imperial identity” will go beyond that of tribes and peoples, focused instead upon the empire itself. Let our people be divided no longer – now and forever, we shall be one nation, one family of the sons and daughters of Inti! Even if certain extreme measures may be needed in order to do it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_granada_title;Expand Chinchaysuyu Northwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_granada_desc;Centuries ago, Tawantinsuyu extended much further north than it currently does, all the way into the central area of what the Spanish barbarians dubbed “New Granada.” These lands were once populated by robust peoples such as the Musica, and though the Spanish may have devoured their nations, their descendants remain in rural communities. Furthermore, many Granadans are themselves descended from these peoples, however much their white rulers may pretend otherwise. There are also large communities of enslaved and oppressed Africans across Granada, an unacceptably savage practice so beloved by the European brutes. Our government has thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the liberation of the “mestizos'' and the Afro-Latinos of the north is our sacred mission, our destiny! Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into Chinchaysuyu for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_title;Expand Antisuyu Eastwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
claiming_the_amazon_desc;As we consolidate our righteous leadership of the native peoples of Ameriga – under the benevolent protection of Tawantinsuyu and the rule of its Sapa Inca, of course – we look to the mighty eastern river, the Amassona, and its peoples. It is well known that the white Amerigans, especially the scheming savages of Amazonie and Atlantia, see the peoples of the east as chaff to cast out. We know better! These people, primitive though they may be, are still superior to any European. We are the defenders of the natives of Ameriga and thus it is imperative that we take control of the entire region – the whole Amassona basin! – to prevent what monstrous iniquities Europe inflicted upon northern and eastern Ameriga from playing out once again. Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into Antisuyu for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_afro_INC_title;Integrate the Afro-Latinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_afro_INC_desc;When the vile Spanish beasts invaded the continent, they did not come alone. After their barbaric and brutal slavery worked the honorable indigenous peoples of the north to death, spreading slaughter and disease across the region, they needed new chattel for their blood-soaked empire. They found it in Africa, and for centuries the sons and daughters of the Dark Continent greased the wheels of the Spanish Empire with their gore and viscera. But a new day is dawning in Ameriga, one where the so-called “colored” peoples – under the glorious leadership of Tawantinsuyu – are marching against white supremacy. There is no better way to enshrine this, then, than raising up the Afro-Latino peoples of our newly liberated lands to official status and placing them in positions of leadership over the Hispanic settlers which once degraded and tyrannized them. Surely the whites will appreciate the irony, and the blacks will become loyal subjects of our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NCLM1.T;The Colombian Alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM1.D;For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms.” The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. §RWe are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return.§ Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM2.T;The Nova Reconquista;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM2.D;The radical Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808, and sought to inject mad liberalism into the Spanish colonial system. King Pedro III fought back, with the Dual Monarchy’s help, in the Peninsular War, prevailing in 1815. Pedro then restored absolutism in Spain, promulgating the Petrine Reforms to consolidate the colonial administration. For some reason, this did not satisfy the insolent criollos, who declared a revolutionary Mexican Republic in 1817! While we crushed it, we were not thorough enough. Now, Spanish Arcadia has taken up arms against the Crown under the banner of the Colombian Alliance. Only New Granada and Cuba remain secure. Currently, we are observing an armed truce with the Alliance. Some believe that we should finish the fight and annihilate the rebels, while more cautious ministers argue that it would be more sensible to consolidate our position in New Granada. §RTo resume the war would be to bet the fate of Spain upon victory…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM3.D;As we feared, the appetite of the Spanish beast for blood and slaughter knows no limits. Spain has ended the armistice by formally announcing their intent to resume their efforts to destroy us. As our brave and noble soldiers march forth into battle, they do not go alone. They go with the spirits and the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the Colombian Alliance, with the love and the trust of every precious life which they are sworn to lay down their own to defend. Northern Arcadia and southern Ameriga have achieved freedom from their colonial masters – we can do no less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM4.T;Bombing of the Caracas Armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM4.D;As we continue our struggle against the Colombian Alliance, we must also deal with the rebels within our own midst. A fortnight ago, the Caracas Armory exploded in the middle of the night. Many soldiers and civilians were injured, and some were killed. As the Army investigates the situation, a disturbing theory has emerged that the explosion was not simply Colombian sabotage but may have been set off to cover up a robbery of the armory’s munitions. If this is true, then the prime suspect would be Antonio Rocafuerte, one of the rare radicals in the loyalist-dominated region of New Castille within New Granada. The llanero (cowboy) Rocafuerte is the right-hand man of Guillermo de Blanco, a rogue warlord and disciple of infamous revolutionary José de Herrera. De Blanco has been at large for years, roaming through the countryside with a hardcore band of followers. If Rocafuerte’s feared Legion of Hell can strike in a place as secure as Caracas, then nowhere in New Granada may be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM4.A;It was probably just some freak accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM5.T;The Maracaibo Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM5.D;A serious incident occurred recently in the city of Maracaibo, located on the northern New Granadan coast. A party of men dressed in Spanish Army uniforms entered the town and requested access to the armory. However, the improbably clean and unblemished state of their uniforms and their officers’ distinctive lack of any peninsular accents tipped off the guards that something was amiss. Upon being challenged, the “soldiers” were revealed to be revolutionaries in disguise! Forcing their way into the armory, they then launched a revolt aided by liberal residents of Maracaibo and seized control of the city in the names of Rocafuerte and de Blanco. The revolt lasted for several days before loyalist reinforcements arrived. Spanish troops fought street-by-street all the way to the rebel’s holdout in the armory, significantly damaging the city in the process. While the revolt has now been crushed, the incident has stoked the flames of independence throughout New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM5.A;Damned brigands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM6.T;An Armistice to End All Colombian Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM6.D;The War of Colombian Independence has devastated the New World and wreaked havoc upon Spain’s economy and political stability, not to mention the cost in human lives. So much blood has been shed, in fact, that Spain has been driven to accept the loss of the northern half of their New World colonial empire. In a diplomatic ceremony in Lisbon, Spain has recognized the independence of the Colombian Alliance. Joyous cries of celebration ring out from Lusitania to Andagoya, but the mood in Spain is one of fear, anxiety, and doubt towards an uncertain future. New Spain has decisively slipped from its old master’s hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM6.A;All who have served the Crown have plowed the sea…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM7.T;Disaster on the Horizon;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM7.D;With our soldiers still not yet in reach of the Colombian traitors’ bastion of Mexico City, the notorious Guillermo de Blanco is preparing to return to conventional warfare. Emboldened by the continued failure of the Spanish Army to subdue the Colombian Alliance, de Blanco has been rapidly rebuilding support among local New Granadan elites and military officers for an armed uprising. It is believed that de Blanco seeks to incite a revolution of his own in New Granada, positioning himself as de Herrera’s successor. If he were to launch such a revolt, the effort required to squash it would require all but abandoning the field of battle to the Colombians. §RIt may be wise to accept the loss of New Spain and focus on preventing the loss of New Granada as well.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM8.D;Guillermo de Blanco’s efforts to incite revolution in New Granada have forced the peninsular Spaniards to finally admit that we are beyond their grasp. They have abandoned all attempts to subjugate us, withdrawing their forces south to prepare for whatever calamity lies in wait for them in New Granada. While we can only express our hope that de Blanco’s endeavors are successful, for now let us rejoice that the bloodshed and struggle of the past has ended in our victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM9.T;The Alliance Secured;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM9.D;Throughout its existence, the Colombian Alliance has been in a twilight zone of half-nationhood. A massive conglomeration of regions, cultures, and languages, many feared that the Alliance would disintegrate as soon as the war with Spain was won. It seems, however, that these fears were misplaced, or at least exaggerated. Colombia has persevered as a unified entity, albeit as a highly decentralized confederation. The goal now is to untangle the government and find a stable, durable form of administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM910.T;The Fall of Bogotà;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM910.D;Guillermo de Blanco has finally made his move. Boosting the ranks of his veteran guerilla army with opportunistic elites, traitorous army personnel, and disgruntled peasantry, de Blanco has emerged from hiding and has launched a series of attacks on New Granadan cities! First Bogota, then Cartagena have fallen before his insurrectionary army. Due to the sparse nature of the New Granadan garrisons with the routing of all available troops to the Colombian front, few outposts are well-staffed enough to oppose him. Worse, many communities are starting to voluntarily align with the increasingly popular revolutionary…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM910.A;The ghost of de Herrera looms large over New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM10.T;The Herrerian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM10.D;The full scope of de Blanco’s ambition has been revealed. In a proclamation in Bogota, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and though he might be a traitorous madman, he has added many souls to his already sizable guerilla army. As village after village, city after city, province after province rises in support of him, northern Ameriga once more plunges into the inferno. This may be the beginning of yet another bitter struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM10.A;May de Blanco follow his predecessor to Hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM11.T;The Return of Ballivián;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM11.D;When revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Quito and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. De Herrara perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness. Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Tupac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. However, with de Blanco once again waging war against Spain, another one of de Herrera’s old compatriots has returned from hiding. An army of Balliviánists, supplied by de Blanco, has stormed into Quito, with Ballivián himself arriving in Quito on a whaling ship. Ballivián’s rapid advance caught nearly all Quiteneses off guard, and he has been proclaimed President of Quito as both the Realists and the Romanticists head back into the political underground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM11.A;Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM110.T;The 5th of March Demonstrations;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM110.D;Spain’s position in the New World continues to be thrown into doubt. After the Crown announced its recognition of the independence of the Colombian Confederation, and the dissolution of the Golden Board of Atlantia, the Romanticists escalated their liberal rhetoric. This has culminated in a series of protests in Quito to object to Spain’s onerous rule. They focused on three points : first, that it was Quiteneses, not Spaniards, who won the day against Washkar Inca, second, that Spain had never acknowledged or healed Cisandina damage during the War of 1826, and third, that a Crown-appointed caudillo and emphasis on Lisbon’s role in administration is an obsolete system in need of reform. The decision to hold the protests on the 5th of March was especially provocative : the First Mexican Republic was proclaimed on that day in Mexico City in 1817. The Duke of Tupac has made vague assurances of reforms but the event has further inflamed political tensions in Quito and may have caught Spanish attention as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM110.A;As if we needed more trouble…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.T;Responding to the 5th of March Demonstrations;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.D;Political turmoil has wracked Cisandina, our errant viceroyalty in western Ameriga. Its current Viceroy, the Duke of Tupac, was given the job in recognition of his role in assembling the Army of the Volunteers, a ragtag force of Chimu, Quechua, mestizo, and Spanish forces, to oppose Washkar Inca, who rampaged through Quito all the way to Chan Chan in retaliation for revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco raiding the Incan capital of Cusco. Tupac has proven a mercurial caudillo, one with dubious political ideas who continues to push the limits of acceptable conduct for a viceroy. Recently, protests have erupted against our rule in Quito, and Viceroy Tupac has been alarmingly slow to retaliate against them. Furthermore, Spanish officers in Quito have reported suspicious activity between known Quitenese radicals and individuals believed to be affiliated with de Blanco. This clearly requires action, but what sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.A;Reprimand Tupac, he must remember his place and his oath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.B;Demand that Tupac arrest all radicals within the colony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.D;The Duke of Tupac has defied us! The viceroy has refused to support a crackdown within Cisandina, claiming that such a move would endanger the colony’s stability. This unprecedented defiance from a viceroy has shocked the royal court, and our ministers are now urging the King to remove Tupac and his administration from office – by force if necessary. The major risk in doing so is twofold : first, it would require redirecting resources which are currently being used to surveil and suppress radical agents in New Granada, and second, it might provoke the Duke to take extreme measures to defend himself. Yet if we do nothing, these problems shall continue to worsen and the clandestine flow of aid to New Granadan radicals may grow, not to mention the international loss of face. How shall we address the situation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.A;Send a sharper reprimand to the Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.B;Order the Land Army to remove the Viceroy by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM14.T;The Quitenese Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM14.D;When news reached the Duke of Tupac that the Spanish Land Army was mustering to oust him by order of the Crown, he decided that desperate times called for desperate measures. At a hastily convened meeting of Quitenese political leaders, including Chimu and Quechuan lords, the Duke declared the independence of the Republic of Quito! Tupac cited the continued tyranny of the Spanish government, specifically the reviled Petrine Reforms, as his motivation, and promised to form a wide coalition to defend against Spain. With both Spain and Quito gearing up for the struggle to come, certain things have fallen by the wayside – such as the targeting of de Blanco’s supply lines, which have quietly resurged now that Tupac and the Crown have directed their attention elsewhere and the Spanish position in Quito has been abruptly terminated. As Quito prepares to fight, another revolutionary may soon take to the field in New Granada, but as far as Tupac is concerned…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM15.T;The Raid on the Caracas Armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM15.D;We thought that the end of the struggle with Colombia would inaugurate a new era of stability in the rest of our empire, but this seems to have been too optimistic. This morning, word reached the royal court that the Spanish Army’s Caracas armory was looted by the guerilla forces of notorious revolutionary Guillermo de Blanco! Apparently, Antonio Rocafuerte, a llanero (cowboy) warlord who is de Blanco’s right-hand man and a native of New Castille, used a little-known mountain path to bypass the local patrols, then assaulted the town shortly after midnight. His feared Legion of Hell overpowered the initial defenses and headed straight for the armory, blowing open the doors and grabbing all the arms and ammunition that they could carry. As they absconded back into the wilderness, they shouted horrid curses towards the Spanish crown, and cried, “Viva Rocafuerte! Viva de Blanco!” De Blanco’s traitors are now quite well-armed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM15.A;Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM16.T;Raids in Cartagena Countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM16.D;De Blanco wasted no time in putting his ill-gotten gains to use. He has returned to a more confrontational posture, launching coordinated assaults upon loyalist communities throughout the greater Cartagena region. Guerillas have attacked villages across the area, pilfering everything from crops and livestock to tools and medicine. Any town which does not sufficiently “support” de Blanco’s cause is a potential target. All the while, Rocafuerte works in the shadows of New Castille to undermine the Spanish government with more subtle means – we certainly can’t spare the resources to hunt him down at this point. As the guerillas wage their most ambitious campaign of violence yet, de Blanco is slowly but surely approaching Bogota, local administrative center of New Granada. If Bogota falls, the whole Spanish colonial government may be imperiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM16.A;Bogota must not fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM17.T;The Bogota Uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM17.D;With much of New Granada affected by de Blanco’s attacks, the defenders of Bogota were determined not to make the mistakes of others. The city’s armory and granaries were put under heavy guard, local Indians were enlisted to identify little-known paths, and rural militias were made ready to repel invaders. There was only one matter which eluded our notice : the loyalty of the Bogotan garrison itself. With the burden of the Colombian war and de Blanco’s campaign of terror drawing so much attention, the condition – particularly the salaries – of local soldiers became rather degraded. Several of de Blanco’s sympathizers, some of them women, were able to infiltrate the city and contact the garrison, promising them great rewards if they defected. Soon enough, the garrison mutinied, and opened the gates of the city to de Blanco’s army. Bogota, one of the most important cities in New Granada, is now in de Blanco’s hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM17.A;Is there no end to the New World’s legions of traitors!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM18.T;The Herrerian Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM18.D;With the acquisition of Bogota, de Blanco is now prepared to fully contest Spanish rule of New Granada. In a speech delivered from the former viceroy’s mansion, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and with much of New Granada now aligned towards him, he might just be able to back up his claims. Rocafuerte’s intrigues have been unable to topple New Castille in time, but if de Blanco is successful then he too shall surely triumph. As northern Ameriga plunges back into the inferno, we must once again prepare for a bitter struggle in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM19.T;Ballivián’s Insurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM19.D;When revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Quito and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. De Herrara perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness. Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Tupac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. Now, however, de Blanco has launched a new revolution against Spain, and has aided his old compatriot Ballivián in making a bid for Quito! Traitorous army units are already mutinying in favor of the guerilla leader, but there still remain enough loyal forces that Ballivián might be able to be thwarted with a swift enough response, unless the revolt gains too much momentum…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM19.A;The mutiny spreads and sweeps Ballivián into the presidency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM19.B;The mutiny is crushed, and Ballivián flees into exile once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM190.T;The Second Army of the Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM190.D;While Ballivián was able to secure generals’ loyalty with vast concessions, the common people had not forgotten his role in the ransacking of Quito. Native, mestizo, and Spanish communities all burned with rage at the thought of the man who laid waste to their homes now ruling them. In the face of Ballivián’s dictatorship, the Romanticists used their secret societies to rally anti-Ballivián sentiment across Quito, and the Realists agreed to an emergency alliance to save the nation. This led to the formation of a multi-ethnic Second Army of the Volunteers, inspired by the ad hoc force which defeated Washkar Inca. Yesterday, they launched revolts throughout the Quito countryside before converging upon the city. Ballivián sallied forth with his loyalists, but the Volunteers shattered the dictator’s army and seized Ballivián, trying, convicting, and executing him for treason. A new government has been formed, and with the Realists sidelined, the Romanticists have taken the lead in bringing revolutionary democracy to Quito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM190.A;May the Revolution burn eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.T;Herreria Calls for Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.D;Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish. As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.A;Herreria calls, and Colombia will answer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.B;Let de Blanco fight his own battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.T;The Herrerian Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.D;De Blanco’s revolution has spread like a cancer throughout New Granada. While Rocafuerte has so far failed to incite revolt in the eastern region of New Castille, enough local western elites have been swayed to de Blanco’s cause that he effectively controls half of the colony. He has proven totally unwilling to negotiate, demanding nothing less than unconditional and immediate independence. This cannot be permitted! Spain must not be driven from the New World! We shall fight to the bitter end to preserve our power and fight back against the tide of radicalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.A;Viva o Rey, viva Espanha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM22.T;Herreria Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM22.D;The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Spanish forces have been beaten at every turn and forced out of Herreria, and Rocafuerte has finally driven New Castille into joining de Blanco’s revolution. The failure in New Granada has led to the total collapse of the Spanish war effort throughout the New World, as the morale of the military crashes and Spain is forced to retreat to the Caribbean.  Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM23.T;The Treaty of Lisbon;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM23.D;The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Though Spain struggled mightily, Spanish forces have suffered a series of particularly disastrous defeats which have totally shattered its armies and sent morale into an unrecoverable dive, as the New Castillians finally abandon Spain and throw their support behind Rocafuerte’s own revolution. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss.

NCLM24.T;Peace in New Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM24.D;Spain and Herreria have fought one another to exhaustion, with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. While Spain was ready to recognize Herreria’s independence in exchange for keeping control of New Castille, it seems that fate had other plans. Towards the close of the conflict, Rocafuerte finally amassed enough support for a revolution of his own. With many elites disillusioned by Spain’s failure to defeat de Blanco, Rocafuerte rode the tide of unrest all the way into the presidency of the revolutionary Republic of Cumaná. The failure of the New Granadan front has caused the entire Spanish war effort throughout the New World to disintegrate. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM24.A;Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM25.T;Granada Reconquered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM25.D;For all of de Blanco’s bluster and bravado, he proved to be a far less able military leader than a guerilla commander. Spanish troops, operating out of supply bases in the loyal region of New Castille, crushed the Herrerian rebels in a series of decisive battles, and secured all the major cities in western New Granada. Seeing Herreria’s failure, the Colombians have sued for peace, and we have regained control of New Granada at the expense of surrendering our claim to New Spain. De Blanco has been put on a clipper ship back to Spain for trial for treason, and Rocafuerte has fled into exile in Colombia. With New Granada back under rightful Spanish rule, the perseverance of our empire in the New World in at least some form has been assured. The stain of Colombia’s independence, however, will be difficult to erase from our political consciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM25.A;At least we may celebrate this victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.T;The Nova Reconquista Completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.D;Alleluia! Once more the Spanish banner flies over the heart of the New World, from Lusitania to Essequibo. The traitors lie vanquished before us, their armies annihilated, and the rebel cities pacified. Anastasio Vicente died fighting during the siege of Mexico City, while notorious New Granadan warlord Guillermo de Blanco and his first lieutenant Antonio Rocafuerte were apprehended in Cartagena while preparing to board an express ship to Etruria, disguised as Catholic monks. Both have been placed under armed guard and sent back to Spain to face trial for treason, and, after conviction, a speedy execution is expected to follow. The Pope himself has praised our victory as a sign of God’s favor and the triumph of the Catholic faith and its holy monarchs over the wickedness of radicalism. As the Spanish Empire experiences a glorious rebirth, nations around the world are reevaluating their plans to account for a Spain which has retaken its place as a true Great Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.A;God willed it, and in His sign we have conquered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.T;Collapse of the Colombian and Herrerian Revolutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.D;The flame of independence in the Spanish New World has been extinguished, stamped out by the boots of the Spanish Land Army. As the rebellious lands are reorganized back into viceroyalties and the old colonial hierarchy reasserts itself, we find our position precarious indeed. Quito has become a byword for treachery among the Spanish royal court, and we must decide as to how we shall approach the Spanish Empire now that it has won its blood-soaked triumph. Shall we submit to the inevitable and render up ourselves to the Crown, confirming our vassalage? Or shall we make a final stand for freedom and liberty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.A;All we can do is tend our gardens beneath the Spanish flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.B;We must dare to dream the impossible dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.T;The Quitenese War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.D;After New Granada was restabilized, an envoy was dispatched to Cisandina to formally confirm their place within the Spanish Empire and make a general assessment of the local conditions. Unexpectedly, the envoy was violently ejected from Quito, which has declared itself an independent republic! It seems that de Herrera’s spirit of liberty has returned to haunt the Spanish New World for one final time. The last battle for the Spanish Empire begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.A;Deus vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.T;The Second Colombian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.D;”When this country was emancipated, it sought equality, justice, and reason. Yet the representatives that were elected did not represent the people, and the leaders that were chosen have not led us to success. The aim of this proclamation is to make clear the necessity of restoring honor to the nation…” – General Agustín de Santander\n\nThe failure of the Colombian government to support the Herrerian Revolution and the collapse of the radical cause in New Granada has spurred dissent against the Vicente regime. A conservative general named Agustín de Santander took advantage of Vicente being confined to his bed with a fever, and led a military contingent into Mexico City, declaring himself the new President of Colombia. With the opposition paralyzed, it seems that Santander’s reign has already begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.A;Viva o Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.T;The Fate of Vicente;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.D;President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain. Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.A;His faithful black cat, Santa Anna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.B;An assassin, who guns him down and flees out the window!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.T;The Death of Vicente;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.D;Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds. Two sides have emerged : the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.A;God help us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.T;The Plan of Toluca;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.D;Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lusitanian General Deodoro Peixoto managed to secure control of the Mexico City countryside. Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in Toluca and proclaimed the Plan of Toluca. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way. With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.A;Perhaps we were not meant to be one nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.T;The Oaxaca Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.D;Tensions in Colombia exploded in the aftermath of President Vicente’s assassination. No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation. President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution. What shall be the fate of Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.A;Peixoto secures Colombia’s end – and Lusitania for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.B;Castro invades the city, arrests the radicals, and seizes Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM34.T;The Plan of Veracruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM34.D;Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lieutenant Colonel Castro took control of the vital port city of Veracruz while order in the rest of the country began to collapse. A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it. Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President.;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM34.A;Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.T;Castro’s Inaugural Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.D;After Castro was sworn into office, he gave a speech to the assembled crowd, outlining his goals and intentions going forward. “Colombia is destined to be a colossus of the New World,” he declared, “but only if we give her the sword and the shield which she needs.” Castro went on to explain that this meant a strong, centralized government, an orderly political sphere, and a bold foreign policy “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” He confidently predicted that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.” Castro wound up his remarks by stating that he was “prepared to bring a new, visionary strength to the Colombian executive, the likes of which few have seen before, or even dreamt of.” Centralists and expansionists were thrilled by his rhetoric, but many others - especially rural elites - were concerned by his implications. §RIf Castro does not make Colombia a world power, then there may be consequences.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.A;May he steward Colombia well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.T;The Cuban Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.D;As Castro continues to reshape domestic politics, he has taken an interest in foreign affairs as well. Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.” The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. §RIf Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.A;Cuba was, is, and will be Colombian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.T;The Plan of Colima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.D;”I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro\n\nIn the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.A;Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.T;The Plan of Colima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.D;Castro’s overthrow by a liberal revolution was supposed to usher in a new era of enlightened, scientific governance. Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality. Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting out the liberals and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.A;Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.T;Emperor Ernesto Assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.D;Emperor Ernesto created a strong, centralized government, a powerful nation free from caudillismo : for him to take up a crown in the aftermath was only natural. Some, however, disagreed, despising Ernesto for violating their notions of Colombian republicanism. Now these traitors have committed the vilest crime. As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital. The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.A;The end of an era, or merely the start of one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.T;The Golden Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.D;The assassination of Emperor Ernesto may not have incited a civil war, but the political situation is nevertheless perilous. Many republicans resigned themselves to quieter means of political struggle while Ernesto the First was alive, but news of his death threatened to give his enemies the chance to tear down the institutions which he built. The landlords and caudillos certainly had no special attraction to the man they saw as the reason for their decline. Thus, to prevent the republicans from deposing the regency, the monarchists have been forced to make massive concessions to their political rivals for the sake of national unity. The “Golden Constitution,” as liberals have called it, extends tremendous political rights, including universal suffrage and a free press, while also federalizing the government. Ernesto the First would be turning in his grave if he knew what the regency council has done but at least the empire which he built will survive him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.A;Respect for the rights of others means peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.D;President Vicente has announced his boldest plan yet : the creation of a Colombian constitution to transform the nation into a united, democratic, parliamentary republic. The document lays out protections for the rights of the people, and clarifies the roles, powers, and responsibilities of the national government. While Vicente has taken care to delineate the boundaries of federal authority and reserve numerous rights and duties to the provinces, the document has already drawn strong criticism from provincial caudillos as a dictum handed down from above rather than the result of popular debate. The president is counting on his status as a national hero, and the courting of liberal sentiments, to ensure the constitution’s ratification, and drafts are already being delivered to the Colombian state governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.A;Is democracy within reach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.T;The Morelia Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.D;The new constitution has been met with concern and suspicion by many Colombian caudillos. Many of them have now gathered in Morelia, where they have drafted a document to explain their objections to Vicente and his supporters. The manifesto claims that the constitution as written concentrates an unacceptable amount of power into the hands of the federal government, opening the door for any of Vicente’s successors to use it to strangle the provinces. Moreover, they have criticized the process of the constitution’s promulgation, objecting to having been left out of the creative process. While the manifesto reaffirms the caudillos’ loyalty to Colombia and its president, denouncing anyone who attempts to use their criticism as grounds for secession, the manifesto’s conclusion declares that “All who sign this document in doing so declare their intent to withhold their signature from the new constitution in its present form.” Most of Colombia’s caudillos have signed it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.A;This will not do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.T;Vicente Calls the Veracruz Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.D;While a more brash type might have attempted to ram the constitution down the caudillos’ throats, Vicente has not gotten to where he is by resorting to violence so easily. Recognizing that the caudillos have merely objected to the constitution’s form, not its existence, he has summoned all the major caudillos of Colombia to a conference in Veracruz to devise a revision to the current constitutional draft. By involving all caudillos in the writing process, nobody will be able to say that they were left out of the discussion. Hopes are high that the conference will bring reconciliation and avoid a crisis, but only time will tell if Vicente’s idealism will survive the caudillos’ objections. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.A;To Veracruz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.T;The Veracruz Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.D;Presidente Vicente and all the state caudillos of Colombia have arrived in the city of Veracruz to revise the constitution into a form acceptable by all parties. At stake is not simply the future of Colombia’s government, but the very ideas of representative democracy and liberal republicanism. Vicente is serious about defending his ideas, but he knows that even he, the “Father of the Nation,” is not invincible. §RIf Vicente and his liberal supporters reject too many of the conservatives’ proposals, then the consequences for both the constitution and the republic may be dire.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.A;Let’s get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.T;Education Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.D;The first matter to spark serious debate is the future of schooling in Colombia. Vicente and the liberals want a school system with funding at both the state and federal level, a national curriculum, and mandatory enrollment. Many caudillos have objected to this, seeing it as being too overreaching, and have demanded minimal federal guidelines for education and no funding mandates on states. Moderates have suggested that the Ministry of Education focus on ensuring national literacy, with the form of schooling up to individual states to decide. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.A;The liberal option of large federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.B;The compromise option of small federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.C;The conservative option of no federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.T;Immigration Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.D;The next contentious matter is that of Colombian immigration. Ever since the Alliance coalesced, the government has essentially avoided the topic, preferring to focus on consolidation and defending against Spain. With Colombia’s future as a nation seemingly confirmed, however, liberals have argued that a national, official “open door” policy should be adopted to draw new immigrants to enrich the nation. Many conservatives, however, feel that such topics are inappropriate for this conference, and the caudillos are intensely wary of language setting down immigration as something which only the federal government, not individual state governments, can control. Moderates have suggested inserting immigration-friendly language into the constitutional preamble, the part most likely to be read by foreigners, but without any new immigration laws. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.A;The liberal option of an official open door policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.B;The moderate option of pro-immigration imagery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.C;The conservative option of ignoring immigration for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM460.T;Native Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM460.D;Tremendous arguments have emerged around the issue of the native populations within Colombia. Liberals seek paths for natives to obtain full citizenship, so long as they meet certain qualifications of literacy and personal morality, and the creation of an Office of Native Affairs to assist in the assimilation of native peoples into Colombian society. Many caudillos, however, do not want native peoples to receive any special treatment beyond necessary measures to root out “antisocial behaviors and savage customs,” and furthermore believe that such matters are purely a state and local issue. Moderates have backed the creation of an Office of Native Affairs but suggest that it instead focus on establishing dedicated living areas for native peoples to inhabit in peace. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM460.A;The liberal option of strong aid for native assimilation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM460.B;The compromise option of moderate aid for native reservations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM460.C;The conservative option of minimal aid for native integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.T;Military Service Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.D;Debate has finally reached the topic which Vicente has been dreading : the composition of the Colombian military. Ever since the end of the conflict with Spain, Vicente has believed that only a robust system of mandatory military training and service, drawing upon all levels of society, could provide Colombia with the defense it needs. Such a concept strikes at the very heart of aristocratic and stratocratic privilege which supports many provincial caudillos and is anathema to the traditionalist officer corps of the Colombian military. Moderates have proposed a minimal program of basic training for all adult Colombian males, but even this may be too much for the conservatives to stomach. At the heart of this debate is a question : do the states control their militaries, loaning them to the federal government when needed? Or does the federal government control the military, calling upon anyone who can fight and making rich and poor man alike an equally capable soldier? The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.A;The liberal option of mandatory service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.B;The moderate option of basic training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.C;The conservative option of the traditional military organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.T;Ratification of the Colombian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.D;After tense and extensive debate between liberals and conservatives, President Vicente and the provincial caudillos have finally arrived at a compromise and drafted a new Colombian constitution. Though highly conservative in some respects, the final document upholds Vicente’s principles of democratic, representative federalism. Furthermore, the conference has established a positive precedent for the peaceful resolution of Colombia’s political disputes via debate and collaboration, not intrigue and warfare. All eyes are now on Vicente, to see if he will be able to prove the constitution’s worth by elevating Colombia to new heights of greatness. If he cannot do so even with the document which he and his supporters worked so hard to achieve, then the luster may fade from his achievement and the wolves may once again lurk at the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.A;We shall not disappoint the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.T;The Treason of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.D;The Veracruz Conference, rather than find a compromise between President Vicente and his critics, instead saw the liberals attempt to force upon the conservatives a document which they had no interest in supporting. When news of this leaked out, General Agustín de Santander, a man known for his aristocratic background and his strong ties to various Colombian landlords, declared the conference illegal and attempted to arrest Vicente and his liberal supporters! While many reformists were seized by Santander’s rebels, a few managed to smuggle Vicente out of Veracruz and back to Mexico City. As the constitutional draft languishes forgotten, the future of Colombia hangs in the balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.A;A disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.T;A Midnight Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.D;Santander soon realized that he’d been tricked : with no sign of Vicente within Veracruz, he raced to Mexico City and will soon be at its gates. In the middle of the night, with Santander and his forces expected to arrive the next morning, Vicente is called upon by two mysterious men. After his guards search them and Vicente receives them in his office, they reveal themselves : Deodoro Peixoto and Puente de Marquez, the two most powerful caudillos in Colombia. They explain that they have come as representatives of Colombia’s caudillos, who do not trust Santander and fear that he may become a tyrant in ways which Vicente has never been. Therefore, they are willing to throw their forces to Vicente’s defense and shatter Santander’s coup attempt, but their price is steep. Peixoto and de Marquez demand nothing less than total autonomy for their states in return for their aid, and warn that if Vicente refuses, they will swallow their pride and back Santander to prevent liberal domination. What happened next is well recorded…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.A;Vicente agreed, and Santander was defeated and executed for treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.B;Vicente refused, and was deposed and exiled days later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.T;The Plan of Veracruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.D;With Santander defeated by the caudillos, Vicente has had to hold up his end of the bargain. He has returned to Veracruz, this time not to build a new Colombia, but perhaps to set the stage for its fall. By the terms of the newly published Plan of Veracruz, vast swathes of Colombia have become virtually sovereign except in matters of foreign affairs and defense. Although the new Colombian constitution has been promulgated within Colombia proper, it will not be applicable within the territories of Lusitania or San Salvador. Many liberals are horrified with what they see as a critical weakening of Colombia. Vicente has defended Colombian democracy, but only time will tell if it was worth the cost. §RIf Lusitania or San Salvador become entirely independent from Colombia then even Vicente may not be able to prevent total dissolution.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.A;The Colombian dream hangs by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.T;Our New Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.D;Our nation is now an autonomous component of Colombia, sovereign internally but dependent externally. How long this shall last – and whether it will lead to our independence – remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.A;Liberty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM520.T;The End of Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM520.D;The Colombian dream is over. This morning, President Anastasio Vicente was found deceased in his bed, having passed away in the night. News of the President’s death has caused the remaining caudillos to lose whatever shreds of loyalty they still possessed towards the federal government in Mexico City. Given that one of the ‘autonomous territories’ had already become independent, this came as little surprise, yet it confirmed what many had known for some time already : Colombia has followed its father to the grave. Vice President Benito Villa was sworn in shortly after Vicente’s death was discovered, and his first act as president was to request that the legislature formally dissolve Colombia and institute a new nation in its place - the Mexican Republic. With both Lusitania and San Salvador now beyond our reach, we can only hope that our new nation will know greater peace than the one which we have left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM520.A;The problem with dreams is that you always wake up from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.T;The Rise of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.D;”Do the people of Colombia and those who administrate its provinces have the freedom to act, or do they not? From Vicente, we have been told that we have only the freedom to obey. Is this the greatness which we were promised? We who had the resolution to attack Spanish tyranny also have the resolution to fight Mexico City autocracy. If our leaders cannot lead us to success then we have no reason to follow them.” – General Agustín de Santander \n \n Not everybody has been satisfied with the new constitution, and Colombian reactionaries have found a standard bearer in General Agustín de Santander, a man of aristocratic origins and good friend of the landholding elite. Santander has given several acidic speeches denouncing Vicente as a despot and a man long past his prime. Some dismiss such charges as ludicrous, but his appeal may grow if Vicente cannot achieve sufficiently grand success for Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.A;Colombia shall brook no Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.T;The Plan of Tepic;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.D;Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia. The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. This would be cause for alarm…yet reports indicate that Santander is far less popular than many believe. If Vicente holds firm and quickly issues a response calling on the people to support him against Santander’s scheme, it might foil the whole plot. Of course, Vicente is not a young man, and there is a small but undeniable temptation in retirement... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.A;Perhaps it is time for a changing of the guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.B;Let Colombia answer its father’s call one final time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.T;The Plan of Tepic;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.D;Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia. The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. With much of the Colombian military thoroughly dissatisfied with Vicente, Santander has rallied them to depose the president and inaugurate himself in Vicente’s place. As the Father of the Nation flees into exile, likely never to return, a new order dawns over Colombia, lit by the fire smouldering in Santander’s eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.A;Viva Santander! Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.T;The Reform War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.D;Santander must surely have been disappointed when he realized that the rest of the nation was not going to rally to his traitorous call. However, the General still commands considerable support within his home state of Jalisco, and he has leveraged this into an insurrection. Rallying what limited forces he can muster, Santander has declared his intent to march on Mexico City and depose Vicente! Very few people outside of Jalisco have any expectation that he will prevail, but General Santander is determined to make one final bid for supreme power. As the Jaliscans raise the banner of rebellion, it seems that Vicente’s fight for democracy must once more be fought on the fields of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.A;Death to traitors! Viva Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.T;The End of an Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.D;The defeat and execution of the traitorous General Agustín de Santander has finally given Vicente and the liberals a chance to clean out the reactionary rot that has infested Colombia for far too long. Across the nation, government officials known to be corrupt or arch-reactionaries have been forced to resign, and the elections which have been called to replace them herald the coming of a new generation. It is a generation which shall take at face value Vicente’s principles of democracy and republicanism. Vicente has seen to it that they shall inherit a better nation by promulgating yet another constitutional revision, this time one of true liberal reform, to do what he could not at Veracruz. The legislature has already signed it, and the convention which shall be called to ratify it a mere formality. For the first time since the end of the war with Spain, when Vicente feels the aching in his bones which remind him of his age, he is not troubled, for he knows that he has laid a strong foundation for future Colombians to build upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.A;Liberty is made difficult because it is the accomplishment and perfectness of man. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.T;Herencia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.D;Last night, President Anastasio Vicente decided to retire to bed early to prepare for campaigning to support a liberal candidate, Porfirio Juarez, in the state of Yucatan. When, next morning, the president had not arisen over an hour after usual, a servant discovered that Vicente had passed away in his sleep the previous night. Word soon spread of this, and now all of Colombia is in mourning over the man who had more than earned his title of Father of the Nation. Thousands upon thousands have traveled to Mexico City, from the wealthiest caudillos to threadbare peasants, to pay their respects to the man who sacrificed every ounce of his strength towards liberty and democracy. Vincente leaves behind not only a family of kin, but the family of Colombia, the sons and daughters who have grown up in the same national household and who now must navigate the world without their father. Their inheritance – a strong democracy, an equitable federal government, and a just constitution – is a gift which few others can claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.A;“Amor regge suo imperio senza spada.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.T;The Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.D;When Santander was building up his power base, many people thought that they understood him. They saw him as a friend of the elites, and an enemy of liberalism and centralism, somebody who would create a weak federal government and allow the landlords, the church, and the military to carry on as they always had with minimal fuss. These people thought wrong. Santander certainly valued such institutions, but never as ends – only as means, the means to absolute power, which he now knows is within his grasp. And now that he is in control of Colombia, he intends to use that power to remake the entire nation in his image. He will tolerate those who wish to assist him, but all those who oppose him shall be destroyed. The northerners and the southerners will complain, he knows, but they will soon comprehend the glory of his vision or face the consequences. Colombia is now under a shadow, the shadow of the Santanderana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.A;May God have mercy upon Colombia, for Santander shall have none.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.T;The Plot Against Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.D;Our illustrious President Agustín de Santander has keen powers of perception, far greater than most. This is how he became aware of a vast conspiracy, reaching from remote villages all the way to the halls of power, to destroy his revolution and plunge Colombia into the fires of ruin. Unfortunately, the national gendarmerie is not up to the task of rooting them out by themselves – and they may already be compromised. Therefore, Santander has published a pamphlet, titled “The Plot Against Colombia,” in which he outlines the conspiracy in broad terms and exhorts the citizens of Colombia to be vigilant and assist him in rooting out the traitors across the nation. Already, reports are coming in of hundreds, even thousands of suspicious individuals in Mexico City alone! Men and women denouncing Santander, praising traitors like Vicente, even discussing his overthrow! Lusitania and San Salvador seem to be especially rife with conspirators, and Santander has commanded his loyalists in these regions to be ready for action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.A;If you aren’t with me, then you’re one of THEM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.T;The San Salvador City Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.D;The anti-conspiracy campaign of President Santander has borne fruit even sooner than he had hoped! It seems that a group of loyalists in San Salvador City became aware of rumors that the Salvadoran caudillo, Puente de Marquez, was in contact with Vicentistas abroad to engineer Santander’s overthrow, and that he had been overhead denouncing the president! Outraged at a traitor in such a powerful position, these brave loyalists took it upon themselves to drive him out and deliver justice to him themselves. They attempted to storm the Salvadoran caudillo’s mansion, only halting when they came face to face with his personal guard. Rather than face justice, the cowardly de Marquez ordered his troops to open fire on the courageous patriots! Many virtuous men and women were cut down by the traitors’ legions, and Santander is more convinced than ever of the need to crack down upon these architects of intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.A;The martyrs gave their lives to destroy these criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.T;The Plan of Comayagua;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.D;President Santander’s suspicions have been confirmed : the caudillos have assumed leadership of the conspiracy! This morning the President received notice of a traitorous manifesto published by Lusitania’s Deodoro Peixoto and San Salvador’s Puente de Marquez. This “Plan of Comayagua” endorses such absurd concepts as “freedom against unlawful search and seizure,” and “accountability of the executive branch”! The document exhorts the President to call off the hunt for the conspiracy (Never!), arguing that it does not actually exist (Ridiculous!) and imploring Santander to restore the rule of law (I AM THE LAW!). Santander is unfazed – he knew that the heads of the hydra would rear one day. There is no need to negotiate with traitorous scum. The President has already dispatched gendarmes to arrest and execute the caudillos at once and has furthermore decided to eliminate all obstacles to maximum efficiency by revoking all governorships nationwide. Santander will personally appoint new governors to rule in his name and by his will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.A;Finally, he thinks, sanity is coming to Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.T;Twilight of Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.D;MUTINY! Everywhere Santander looks, the pillars of the nation are collapsing before his very eyes! First, he received word that the gendarmes he sent to punish the caudillos instead swore loyalty to them! Then, both men announced the independence of their respective territories from Colombia! Reports soon began to pour in from the northern and southern frontiers of soldiers native to Lusitania or San Salvador deserting their posts en masse and returning home, or even worse, swearing loyalty to Peixoto or de Marquez. As refugees begin to pour into Lusitania and San Salvador, and foreign investors flee in panic, chaos spreads across the land and it seems as though the conspiracy has succeeded. Santander grits his teeth as he surveys the damage, a map of his former nation sprawled across his desk. He already has a new plan – dangerous, difficult, but full of promise. Summoning the generals still loyal to him, he declares…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.A;”Colombia es muerte! Viva Mexico!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.T;Mexico’s Birthing Pains;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.D;Santander’s brilliant plan to dissolve Colombia and resurrect the insurrectionary state of Mexico has encountered a few small obstacles. First, the loss of Lusitania and San Salvador have sharply reduced the military and the civilian bureaucracy’s size and strength. Second, the breakdown in communications and general confusion have made it very difficult to relay orders outside of the vicinity of the capital. Third, many soldiers have either refused new orders or have departed the service entirely, becoming bandits or actively attempting to resist the new Mexican order. With both the army and the national gendarmerie in such a disorganized state, it is quite difficult to even administer Mexico, let alone bring order to it. In fact, many native communities, so long held in check by police surveillance and the threat of military incursion, have begun to organize militias to police their own communities. If these militias grow in size and strength then they could pose a severe challenge to our authority. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.A;Nothing that our glorious President cannot handle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.T;The Natives are Revolting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.D;With the military and the national gendarmerie forced to focus on essential duties to keep the basic apparatus of government running, many native communities have been left to fend for themselves. Rather than devolving into squalid anarchy, as many officers expected, these communities have instead rapidly assembled militias to protect themselves. Recognizing the danger this posed, Santander wisely ordered said native militias forcibly dissolved. This proved easier said than done, as the pitiful state of the military meant that in many cases the native militias outnumbered the forces sent to arrest them, and said militias pursued the authorities as they withdrew. What started as raids on government outposts has now escalated into outright rebellion, as the Tarascans, the Zapotecs, and the Nahuas have all declared independent states!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.T;The Plan of Guadalajara;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.D;It must be said that the current state of the country is less than ideal. Santander is convinced that a little patience and perseverance, and a lot of hard work, are all that is needed, but many cowardly liberals have lost faith! Gathering in the city of Guadalajara – in Jalisco, the state of his birth, no less! – they have published the “Plan of Guadalajara,” a litany of traitorous denouncements. Accusing Santander of having “committed national patricide,” they have called for new elections, the deposing and trial of Santander for treason, the reversal of centralization, and many other unpatriotic ideas! Worst of all, many soldiers have defected to this newest phase of the anti-Santander conspiracy, and Mexico finds itself even further divided as the liberals declare an insurrection across Jalisco. The stage is set for the most important battle yet for Colombia’s inheritance…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.A;Death to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.B;Sic semper tyrannus! (Play as Jalisco);;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.T;The Salvation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.D;Everywhere he goes, Santander is beset by misfortune, plagued by those who hate him, with only himself to rely upon. Everybody betrays Santander, in the end, if not now then later. The only person that he can ever have faith in is himself. Vicente, the Lusitanians, the Salvadorans, the Indians, now the Jaliscans, so many knives in his back. But Santander knows that this is the turning point against the conspiracy. This is the moment which will break them, the first step on the road to unimaginable power and success. The liberals babble that they will bring “salvation” to Mexico, but Santander knows that HE is the salvation of Mexico. Only Santander can save Mexico. Only Santander can resurrect Colombia. Only Santander can rule, and arbitrate, and govern, and bring peace. Only Santander. Only Santander. Only Santander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.A;Remain calm. There is much to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.T;Endurance of the Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.D;Victory! The Jaliscan usurpers have been annihilated, and all the ringleaders sway from the Mexico City gallows. With the traitorous liberals destroyed, Santander can now turn his attention to those infernal Indians. They had the temerity not only to reject his benevolent rule, but to humiliate his proud forces while they stabbed him in the back and tried to mutilate Mexico! HIS Mexico! The Lusitanians and Salvadorans did so as well, of course, but the blow from people as vile as the natives fell upon the President with even more bitterness. As Santander reviews his options to deal with the situation, he realizes that a simple military campaign will not be enough. No, as long as these troublesome identities persist within Santander’s realm, they will continue to be thorns in his side – the Indians and the Lusitanians are two sides of the same problem. Yes, there will need to be a reckoning, and after that, some more permanent solutions to the problems of separatism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.A;So much work to be done, so little time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.T;Liberalism Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.D;Victory! The reformists have shattered the legions of the mad despot Santander and marched into Mexico City in glory. The dictator himself was found dead in his bedroom, having opened his veins with a knife like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. The hardcore Santandristas were put on trial for treason, and the less ideological minions which he installed across Mexico have been tactfully pressured to resign in exchange for being spared. Though the reign of the tyrant has been ended, much of Mexico lies in ruins, ravaged by war, neglect, and the chaos of the previous years. While Lusitania and San Salvador show no signs of wishing to return to our fold, the native states must be dealt with. The liberals do not wish to annihilate them, as Santander wished, but their very existence is a negation of Mexican sovereignty which cannot be tolerated. The work of rebuilding Mexico must be done both within and without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.A;We shall make Vicente proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.T;The End of the Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.D;Neither the liberals nor the Santandristas have been able to prevail over the other and seize control of Mexico. Once again, the matter has been settled by the military. The young General Manuel Diaz, a pious Catholic but also one with concealed liberal sympathies, emerged as the head of the highly secret anti-Santandrista movement within the Mexican army. Diaz, disgusted at Santander’s excesses and incompetence, has finally intervened, publishing the “Plan of Cuernavaca” to reveal Santander’s worst actions and call upon Mexican forces to stand down and cooperate with the Jaliscan liberals. Santander was slain in a brief gun battle when the Diazistas attempted to arrest him, and the gates of Mexico City have been opened to the liberals. Yet they arrive to find the Diazistas already preparing to insert themselves into positions of power in the new regime. Unity and democracy have returned to Mexico, but their prospects are not rosy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.A;Peace at any price is still peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.T;The Shadow of Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.D;When now-President Deodoro Peixoto declared Lusitania’s independence in order to escape the madness of the Santanderana, neither he nor any other Lusitanian had any illusions that doing so would be enough to secure peace. Soon, Santander will come to take revenge, and if rumors are to be believed then he may be seeking nothing less than a Carthaginian fate for Lusitania. Desperate for allies, Peixoto’s cabinet has proposed that the President swallow his pride and petition the Plantagenians for an alliance. Plantagenia certainly has no desire for a belligerent madman like Santander to place their own nation within striking distance, they argue, which will likely be the result of Lusitania attempting to face Mexico alone. Yet Peixoto knows that the Plantagenians are a greedy people who would likely demand concessions from Lusitania in return for aid. But, his ministers reply, surely bribing the Plantagenians is preferable to what would likely be death at Santander’s hands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.A;Desperate times and all that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.B;Lusitania bows to no master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.T;The Matter of Lusitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.D;The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. Our ministers, however, note that Lusitania currently controls the region of Cymrie, which they call Apacheria and which we have desired for quite some time. Thus, they urge us to propose that Lusitania transfer Cymrie to us as a dowry of our alliance. Of course, others believe that we should weaken Lusitania as a precondition for defending it, or that we should not get involved at all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.A;Make the offer : Cymrie for an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.B;We need no bribe to oppose Mexican tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.C;This does not involve us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.T;The Plantagenian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.D;President Peixoto’s suspicions of Plantagenian greed were confirmed when he received the reply from our delegation in Nouvelle Orleans : Plantagenia will only form an alliance with us if we transfer Apacheria to them. Our ministers are disgusted at such predatory opportunism, but if we wish to secure Plantagenian assistance against Santander, then this seems to be our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.A;Lusitania must survive, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.B;We will not parcel out our homeland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.T;They Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.D;The Plantagenians have agreed to form an alliance against Santander! While we have had to offer certain economic concessions to them to prevent them from demanding any territory from us in exchange, they have concurred with our view that the Mexican despot presents a threat to both of our nations. When Santander comes, we will stand together against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.A;I never thought I’d die fighting side by side with Frenchmen…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.D;The Plantagenians have dismissed our delegation! They declared that our conflict with Santander was not their concern and have left us to our fate. It seems that the only ones who can protect Lusitania are the Lusitanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.A;As expected from the sons of Frenchmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.T;The Matter of Lusitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.D;The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. This may be true, but several of our ministers eye Lusitania as a possible future route for our own expansion, and others simply do not wish to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.A;Lusitania calls for aid, and Plantagenia shall answer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.B;Why defend a strange foreign country of which we know nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.T;The Lusitania Gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.D;Mexico is not and has never been enough for Santander. It was, like so many parts of his life, a means to an end – in this case, a means of shedding the rotting shell of Vicente’s Colombia and starting over fresh. Santander has no issue with the idea of Colombia, merely the form it took under the traitor Vicente, and the conspiracy which infested it. In fact, he intends to reforge it, except this time according to his will and his alone. Lusitania is the first step. If Santander can crush them, he reasons, then reconquering San Salvador will be simple, and then Colombia will be whole once more. Of course, word of his plan has already leaked out in the scurrilous foreign presses, and the element of surprise has to an extent been lost, but no matter! Santander will crush the despicable Peixoto and remove his green stain of a nation from the map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.A;Viva el Presidente, viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM77.T;Lusitania est Pacata;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM77.D;As expected, Lusitania has been shattered by Mexican might! Their cowardly forces could not withstand our awesome assault, and we have brought their entire nation back into our fold. Peixoto had tried to flee to Plantagenia but was intercepted at the border and will be brought back to Mexico City – first for a fair trial, and then, once convicted, an equally fair public hanging. As for the Lusitanians themselves, oh, Santander has plans for them, plans to solve their separatist obsession once and for all. In the meantime, San Salvador awaits final redemption, and the President is overjoyed to see the people finally paying him the support he has always deserved. His triumph over Lusitania has convinced many to accept his rule, or at least cease to challenge it. And why should they? He is, after all, the rightful heir of Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM78.T;The Lusitanian Catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM78.D;In a development which most people except Santander himself privately foresaw, the Mexican armies were unable to subdue Lusitania. Santander’s humiliating failure to reconquer the northern separatists has led to the shattering of his national mystique, and his supporters have rapidly abandoned him. General Manuel Diaz, who had long concealed his liberal views, proclaimed the “Plan of Tepic” as soon as he realized the scope of the Mexican defeat. He denounced Santander as a mad, murderous despot, and promised the restoration of democracy and an end to costly foreign adventures in favor of internal rebuilding. With most of the military supporting them, Diaz and his men seized Mexico City with little trouble. Santander was found dead in his bedroom, having taken a knife to himself like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. With his regime of surveillance and oppression dismantled, many liberals have begun to return from exile, eager to build a more peaceful Mexico. Distressingly, Diaz has been acclaimed as the new Mexican President, but he has sworn to rebuild and uphold the rule of law. Even if he does twist democracy in the future, cynics argue, he has little chance of being worse than Santander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM79.T;The Death of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM79.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander \n \n For the past few years, our esteemed leader Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a conflicted legacy, albeit one defended by many fierce supporters. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and conquered Lusitania when many expected failure. Foreign critics concede that he made Mexico a stronger nation but emphasize the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities. Now that he has passed, Mexico will face even more of an uphill battle if it wants to reclaim Colombia, but the Santandristas still burn with the fire of their icon’s ambition in their hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a massive legacy as the man who withstood Colombia’s death and achieved its resurrection. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and reforged it stronger than before. Even foreign critics concede that he accomplished tremendous feats, and their emphasis of the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities tends to be disregarded by Colombians. Now that he has passed, thousands upon thousands gather in Mexico City to mourn the man even greater than Herrera, and the spiritual leader of Spanish Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM80.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander \n \n For the past few years, President Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. His generals tried to keep the news secret, but it soon leaked out and sparked public celebration, closely followed by massive pro-democracy protests. Rather than spark yet another conflict, most high-ranking Santandristas have fled into exile, paving the way for democracy to establish itself in their place. Santander will forever be known as one of the worst tyrants of the modern era, the destroyer of Colombia and oppressor of Mexico. Foreign critics on both the left and right have rejoiced at the death of an internationally infamous despot. The unitary system which he created will likely be the only monument to his legacy which the vengeful masses do not demolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM81.T;The Fate of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM81.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander \n \n After the recent ousting of President Santander, the new regime arrested and tried him, both to furnish its image and to exorcise the Santanderana from Mexican society. Representing himself, Santander first argued that the trial was illegal as Mexico had no constitution. When the prosecution responded that treason was still criminal, Santander became enraged, accusing the entire court of being part of a vast conspiracy against him, and insisting that everything he did had been to defend Mexico. Witnesses testified about his cruelty, bigotry, and history of paranoid delusions. Towards the end of the trial, he grew prone to sudden outbursts, at one point wailing, “O World, why do you persecute me?” Condemned to death, he was taken to the Mexico City barracks and executed by firing squad. With even reactionaries disowning Santander, many now look with nostalgia towards Anastasio Vicente, who has become a secular saint of Mexican republicanism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM82.T;Dawn of a New Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM82.D;The end of the Santanderana, and the purging of his influence from Mexican politics, has led Mexico and its people to undergo a national rebirth. Freed from the paranoid and violent atmosphere of Santander’s regime, many Mexicans are reconsidering what it means to be a “Mexican.” Colombian restorationism seems to have given way to a new Mexican nationalism, one founded upon democracy and republicanism. To that end, a constitutional conference has concluded in Oaxaca City, codifying the form of the new government. Santander’s hyper-centralism has been discarded in favor of a federal republic, with rights and responsibilities split between state and federal governments without either dominating the other. The resulting system is far from perfect, but it gives Mexico something it has never had before : an official legal foundation upon which to build a society of law and justice. Nothing makes this clearer than Mexico’s new motto…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Colombian power at an all-time high, the time has come to not merely undo the damage of the Plan of Veracruz, but to finally bring an end to Colombia’s legal void. A new constitutional conference will be called, where Lusitania and San Salvador’s autonomies will be abrogated, and where Vicente will finally achieve the liberal democracy of his dreams. At last, he will prove to Peixoto and de Marquez that their fears were unfounded, that he has always had the interests of their peoples at heart just as much as those of Mexico, and that they are all Colombians.

lustanian_mexican_war_desc;Santander is no friend to natives, or Freemasons, or Frenchmen, or Protestants, or…well, he despises many types of people, but he reserves a special kind of hatred for Lusitanians. Vicente might have been the orchestrator of the conspiracy which destroyed Colombia, but Santander is certain that it was aided at every juncture by Lusitanians. The region has always been a nest of separatists, traitors, and other scum, and worst of all, their disgusting, bastard dialect pollutes every word which they speak or write, filling pure Mexican eyes and ears with its hideous distortions! This will be more than a war to reconquer Lusitania, it will be the first part of a war to DESTROY Lusitania, in every sense of the word, like Carthage of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_destruction_of_lusitania_desc;At last, the full breadth of Santander’s plan to end Lusitania is coming to fruition. He has summoned not only his generals and national gendarmerie officers, but linguists, sociologists, jurists, and educational experts. There they have drafted a plan to systematically eradicate Lusitania not only as a nationality, but as a culture, a language, and an idea. Lusitanian artists, intellectuals, and teachers will ‘disappear’ in midnight raids across the region. Lusitanian art and literature will be collected and burned. History books will be rewritten to deny that there was ever any sort of separate Lusitanian identity. Lusitanian styles of clothing, dance, song, and even cooking will be banned in a series of codes cleverly worded to simultaneously deny that separate forms of Lusitanian culture exist. Finally, the Lusitanian dialect will be totally outlawed. If anybody seeks to conduct any government business, if any student of any age wishes to pass their examinations, if any merchant or customer wants to buy or sell anything, then they will use Mexican Spanish and Mexican Spanish only. From this moment onwards, Lusitania has ceased to exist, and it has never existed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So far, the Salvadoran government has not seen things our way, insisting that any attempt to challenge their territorial integrity is a resurrection of the Santanderana. Lies! These territories are rightfully Mexican, seized by Puente de Marquez as a frontier against the mad Santander. They were Mexican lands for hundreds of years, dating back to the original Spanish colonization. Now that Santander is gone, San Salvador has no reason to hold these lands any longer. We will relieve the Salvadorans of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

California has been part of Mexico since the Spanish first explored the region centuries ago. That Lusitania continues to occupy it is a violation of Mexican territorial sovereignty. We must and shall liberate our Californian brethren!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_lst_federation_title;Lusitanian Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_lst_federation_desc;With Mexico reaching an unprecedented level of power and influence, the time has come to seriously consider the prospects of integrating Lusitania into our nation. True, the matter is a delicate emotional subject in both of our nations, having been one of the main goals of the hated Santander. But, as much as we might despise the man himself, it cannot be denied that our nations have many cultural and linguistic similarities. Furthermore, we were separated not by popular decision, but by the will of a single opportunistic caudillo, the Lusitanian Deodoro Peixoto. Surely the will of one strongman is nothing compared to the centuries of history which have bound our two lands together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_consitutional_reform_title;The Indigenous Peoples Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_consitutional_reform_desc;One of the most sinister aspects of the Santanderana was how he sought to exterminate the native populations. Santander frequently accused natives in his propaganda of colluding with foreign powers, spreading crime and disease, and generally being enemies of society, all to justify his campaigns of oppression against them. If he had prevailed, native communities across Mexico could have been wiped out. Ever since the Santanderana’s end, a small but devoted group of radicals have championed indigenous rights, arguing that the native peoples of Mexico have just as much a right to their own cultures, languages, and communities as everyone else. A suggestion has now been put forward to officially protect some of the largest indigenous communities, ending assimilation attempts towards them and permitting them to use their native tongues in official capacities. Not only will this establish Mexico as a beacon of progressive thinking, it will likely deal a tremendous blow to any attempts to rouse separatist sentiments among the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_language_enforcement_title;The Mexican Language Standardization Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_language_enforcement_desc;The wise Santander understood that language is the foundation of the modern nation-state : control the words of the people and you control their society. It was for this reason that he supported the supremacy of Mexican Spanish across the country, to destroy separatism and secure national unity. The indigenous populations have maintained their own savage tongues for far too long and have refused to adopt the civilized language of real Mexicans. Therefore, we shall emulate Santander’s example and enforce strict standards of Mexican Spanish upon all native communities. Henceforth Mexican Spanish shall be the law of the land, and all deviation punished. Within a generation, they will sound no different than any resident of Mexico City. Of course, this process will be greatly expedited by having the national gendarmerie “disappear” all of the scholars and teachers of these backward indigenous tongues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

VIN1.D;”Be servants and you will be deservedly scorned, but fight to be citizens and you will be rightfully strengthened.” – Emil Krag, leader of the Rebellion of 1827\n\nNo colony is as dear to Scandinavia as Vinland. First briefly settled by the Norse, modern Scandinavian settlement began in the early 1600s. Scandinavians (many from Norway) and Finns tended to obtain colonial charters for the north, Germans and Scots for the south. The Scandinavian crown embraced this bifurcation by creating the colonies of Vinland and Masgirland. Plantagenia invaded Vinland in 1799, and while they were defeated, the traumatic experienced sharpened Vinlandic views that Scandinavia was not a reliable protector. The Rebellion of 1827 was sparked due to bitterness about local corruption and lack of representation or self-rule, led by the politician Emil Krag. The revolt was crushed, but both colonies have been under military occupation ever since. A single spark could light the fire anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN2.T;The Crown Colony of Masgirland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN2.D;Masgirland, while settled at the same time as Vinland, has developed a separate identity, mainly due to the difference in its colonization. Unlike Vinland, it was mainly settled by the Germans and the Scottish. The situation in Masgirland is further complicated due to its economy. Much of the colony is reliant upon fishing, and thus upon European export markets. This has led Masgirlanders to, ironically, see themselves as closer to the Scandinavian colonial authorities than the mostly Nordic Vinlanders, who are much more militant about independence and republicanism. While Masgirland has its own discontents about lack of representation within Scandinavia, should Vinland make another bid for freedom, Masgirlanders may struggle to choose a side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN3.T;The Skræling Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN3.D;For many European settlers, the Great Lakes is a barbarian region where civilization has yet to spread. For philosophers, this is a Garden of Eden where noble savages thrive. For Scandinavia, this is their most remote colony. For most of the local tribes - the hundreds of Algonquin and Iroquois nations that inhabit the region and who answer to the Scandinavian governor - the so-called Skræling Council allows them to live in relative peace. But as Vinlanders ask for independence, while the Plantagenians and Belgians eye the border territories, the differences between the Algonquins and the Iroquois are thrown into sharp relief. Europeans may have lumped them together, but they are not one people, not yet at least. Soon they will once again march to war, but will it be against each other or against the settlers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN3.A;Wait – you’re saying there isn’t one big Skræling tribe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN4.T;The Rebellion of 1837;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN4.D;Olaf Larsson, a Vinlandic fur trader of minor renown, has been dissatisfied with the steep Scandinavian tariffs which have greatly cut into his business, and has radicalized into a militant republican. Hoping to ignite a popular revolution against Scandinavian rule, he and a small group of sympathizers held a meeting in which they declared the “Vinlandic Republic” with Larsson as provisional president. This “Executive Council of Vinland” then seized a printing press and began printing announcements of the “creation of the Vinlandic Republic” and exhorting the people to rise. Larsson and company rode across the area, distributing them to whoever they found and goading several mobs to attack Scandinavian patrols. Ultimately, however, many people were more amused or confused by their efforts than inspired, and the “Executive Council” was apprehended by the authorities days after the incident began. However, Larsson’s propaganda is still circulating within the colony, stirring independence sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN5.D;Larsson’s “revolt” of two years ago was a farce, but the radical liberal literature which he distributed has imbued new emotional vibrancy into the VInlandic independence movement. One group which has seen a revival of its fortunes is the Samfunn af Patrioter (Society of Patriots), a secret independence society led by politician Kresten Søndergaard. A small fight in Erikshavn between the Patrioter and several members of the Leifssonklub, clandestine loyalists, soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest, summoning hundreds of members into the countryside to protect the fleeing fugitives. After fending off several Scando-Vinlandic search parties and beginning to snowball in strength and numbers, the Patrioter militia was finally defeated near the frontier of the Belgian Confederacy. We were surprised to learn that Søndergaard himself had been leading the rebels! He is now in custody, and will soon stand trial for treason and insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, several secret societies have been organizing in support of radical liberalism.

As the transport was passing beneath a bridge, however, a single Patriot dashed into the road and aimed a pistol at the driver, ordering him to stop! Simultaneously, a large group of Patriot men leapt over a nearby wall, rushed the vehicle, and forced open the doors.

VIN9.D;With news of Søndergaard’s escape rapidly spreading, it was thought that he wouldn’t be able to hide for long. Thus the Vinlandic government was frustrated at the lack of the search’s progress – until a certain horrid tale reached them. Apparently, Søndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a week ago. Rather than report his capture, the patrol – several of whom had family members who were killed by Patrioter in 1827 and 1839 – decided to enact their own revenge. For days, Søndergaard was tortured in the basement of an abandoned hunting lodge, eventually dying of his wounds. Although the Vinlandic governor demanded that this remain secret, information has a way of leaking out. A fortnight later, the newspaper headlines scream of “THE AGONY OF SØNDERGAARD.” Slowly, people who read the ghastly tale, people who had never been all that political before, begin to discover within themselves a love of liberty, and a hatred of the Scandinavian Crown and the blood-soaked regime that it is propping up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN12.D;The recent loss of Scandinavian control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government into their ranks. Each cell then organized a militia, to be called upon when the time came. That time came about four days ago, when a Scandinavian unit attempted to arrest a Patrioter cell within the Kusbole militia and their comrades came out to defend them. The standoff soon became a battle, one which signaled the initiation of a full-scale Patrioter uprising. Vinlandic officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioters as news of the rebellion spread, and with Scandinavia unable to contain the rebellion, it even spread into Masgirland. Both colonies’ capitals have been seized and the banners of liberal democracy lifted high above Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, and now a battle between a Scandinavian patrol and a Patrioter militia has stirred them to action. A wave of rebellions swept across the colony, and Vinlandic officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioter as news of the revolt spread. The failure of the Scandinavian military to crush the rebellion early allowed it to achieve unprecedented success. Now, cities across Scandinavian Arcadia have been overrun, and the revolt has spread into Masgirland. As the Scandinavian banner is torn down and the banner of liberal democracy raised in its place, it appears that our empire has been cast out of Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN14.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN14.D;The recent abolition of the Scandinavian monarchy has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government and organizing a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came when word reached Vinland of the ousting of the Stuart dynasty. Nielsson quickly marshalled the Patrioter to Erikshavn, where his agents within the colonial government ushered him and his army into the halls of power. Dismissing the governor, Nielsson and the Patrioter proclaimed the Vinlandic Republic, promising to organize a constitutional convention as soon as possible to establish the legal foundation of the new state. The flames of revolution have already spread to Masgirland as well. As Scandinavia shakes off the shackles of monarchy, its Arcadian children cast off their own bonds and claim their newfound freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN16.T;A New Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN16.D;The recent independence of the Vinlandic Republic has sent shock waves across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the rising tide of revolution, and as the new political order inflames our own institutions, we are drifting into the orbit of Vinland more than ever before. For now, we have managed to forestall annexation, but the Vinlanders have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from Scandinavia. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, more than a few Masgirlanders look back upon their fatherland with longing, less so upon their new would-be masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN16.A;We want to remain who we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN17.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN17.D;The entrance of Scandinavia into a major European war has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government and organizing a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came when Scandinavia was forced to curtail its presence in Arcadia due to developments in Europe. The reduced military presence allowed the Patrioter to organize with far greater ease and boldness. Now, they have made their move. Using inside agents recruited from the remaining Scandinavian garrisons, the Patrioter have seized key military and civilian strongpoints across the colony. This has allowed them to swiftly eject the colonial regime from power, installing Nielsson as provisional president pending a constitutional convention. Scandinavia’s weakened grip has allowed Vinland to slip from its mailed fist and soar into freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN18.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN18.D;Vinlandic republicanism has now reached a fever pitch of intensity and power. None embody this better than Vilhelm Schoultz, second-in-command to Vinlandic nationalist Johan Nielsson of the Samfunn af Patrioter. Schoultz, an extremist even by the Samfunn’s standards, successfully contested the leadership in an emergency meeting of the Patrioter’s executive council. He then ordered the mobilization of the Samfunn’s militias and directed them to capture military and civilian targets across Vinland. The battles that followed throughout the colony drew in many volunteers seeking to fight for Vinlandic freedom. With many Erikshavners holding bitter memories of military atrocities, they greatly aided Schoultz’s seizure of the city. Soon, he entered the governor’s office and proclaimed himself Grunnlovens Forsvarar (Constitutional Defender) of the revolutionary Vinlandic Republic. As Patrioter cells carry the revolution into Masgirland and the falløkser are raised up across Vinland, the Tiden av den Røde has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN18.A;Terror is nothing else than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN19.T;A New Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN19.D;The recent independence of the Vinlandic Republic has sent shock waves across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the rising tide of revolution, and as the new political order inflames our own institutions, we are drifting into the orbit of Vinland more than ever before. For now, we have managed to forestall annexation, but the Vinlanders have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from Scandinavia. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, many Masgirlanders are alarmed at the reports of escalating anti-monarchist violence sweeping Vinland…particularly news of ominous bladed contraptions being erected in city squares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN19.A;We want to remain who we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN20.T;The Vinlandic Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN20.D;The Vinlanders did not react well to the news that Copenhagen had discarded their petition for independence. In fact, they reacted so badly that a radical extremist named Vilhelm Schoultz was able to seize control of the Vinlandic independence movement and orchestrate a violent revolution across the colony. With much of Scandinavian Arcadia lost, loyal military and civilian personnel have fallen back to the island of Olavsstad to await reinforcements. We now must decide whether we should indeed attempt to reconquer our Arcadian lands, or accept their loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN21.D;”To arms, Vinlanders,\n\nForm your battalions,\n\nMarch, march!\n\nLet an impure blood\n\nWater our furrows!”\n\n - Dahlborgsangen\n\nAs expected, the murderous Stuarts could not tolerate our enlightened republic. They have declared war upon us, and soon an army of conquest shall arrive upon our shores to bolster the rats which have nested in Olavsstad. Our glorious Grunnlovens Forsvarar Schoultz is already marshalling the new Vinlandic Revolutionary Army to throw them back into the sea! We shall fall upon them with the Viking fury which burns within the heart of all Vinlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN21.A;Stige, Vinland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN22.T;The Treaty of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN22.D;The Scandinavian military has met with a humiliating defeat in the New World. Unable to subdue the insurrectionary colonials, we have finally been forced to admit that the war to reconquer Scandinavian Arcadia is lost. A treaty has been signed in Venice, in which Vinland and Masgirland have both been granted independence. As bitter recriminations echo throughout the streets of Copenhagen, the inferno of revolution burns bright in the West, for good or for ill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN22.A;As it was ages ago, the west is lost to us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.T;The Lion of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.D;Victory at last! The mad Schoultz and his murderous legions have been destroyed, and Scandinavian Arcadia is back in the hands of the Crown. As our soldiers fan out across the region, all the criminals and traitors of the illegitimate “Republic” shall be hunted down like the vermin they are. Meanwhile, our loyal subjects rejoice in our victory, and the restoration of enlightened government across the land. The main question now is what to do with our liberated colonies. Clearly, permanent occupation is unworkable. Some have proposed to appoint younger cousins of the sovereign as rulers of Kingdoms of Vinland and Masgirland. Others feel that the only way to prevent more chaos in the New World is to assume direct rule across Scandinavian Arcadia. How shall we deal with our wayward colonies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.A;Create the Kingdoms of Vinland and Masgirland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.B;Impose direct rule from Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN23.T;The Radicalist Uprising in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN23.D;The growth of radical liberalism across the world has finally spread to Vinland. Johan Nielsson, leader of the militant republican Samfunn af Patrioter, has been gathering weapons for some time. Under pressure from extremist elements within the movement to act, Nielsson decided to launch a coup with limited resources local to Erikshavn. Less than a day ago, the Patrioter stormed out into the city and seized various strategic locations, with Nielsson himself leading a contingent to march to the governor’s office and present a petition demanding immediate independence. Rather than negotiate, the governor locked himself inside. Nielsson then seemed to hesitate, but upon hearing the approach of Vinlandic and Scandinavian troops, ordered his supporters to surround the building and barricade themselves within the city square, effectively taking the governor and the whole city center hostage. As Vinlandic forces attempt to restore order, all of Erikshavn sits on a knife edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN23.A;We shall sweep Erikshavn clean of these vermin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.T;The Erikshavn Bloodbath;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.D;Knowing that the governor and the seat of Vinlandic government were in extreme danger, we urged our officers to quickly rescue them. Unfortunately, they interpreted this order rather…loosely. Lurid and rapidly spreading tales of unarmed rebels shot while fleeing, assaults on civilians suspected of collaboration with the Patrioter, and savage acts against female fighters has inflamed all of Vinland. Stories of rebels lured out with offers of amnesty being executed after surrendering their weapons has drawn outrage. Worst of all, the battle to reclaim the city square and save the governor turned into a meat grinder, with house-to-house fighting and Nielsson dying in a hail of bullets on the steps of the governor’s office. The whole scene has played straight into the republican narrative of revolutionary martyrdom, and Patrioter cells across Vinland are activating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.A;For God’s sake, we were only hunting terrorists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.T;An Unfortunate Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.D;The governor has convened his advisors and officers to consider the current situation in the colony, and the mood around the room is grim. Recent reports suggest that many Vinlandic cities could see Patrioter uprisings of their own very soon. Even in places where republicanism is weak, there is a general sense that the royal Vinlandic government has destroyed its own mandate to govern, and that it has lost the respect and the trust of the people. Though the governor’s officers are adamant that they cannot give in to the republican conspiracy, the civilian part of the council is convinced that the only way to avoid a revolution is to obtain independence. However, their plan would involve a partitioning of the Skræling Territory, along with privately guaranteeing Scandinavia a large stake in an independent Vinland to allow many of those in power to maintain their influence. This, they claim, would allow us to satisfy the minimal demands of the republicans while giving them the least amount of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.A;We are still Scandinavians! No surrender to the Patrioter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.B;If we have a trick up our sleeve then now is the time to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.T;Vinland Requests Conditional Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.D;We have received a strange and shocking petition from our Vinlandic colony : they have asked us for independence! However, this request was made with a lengthy explanation attached. To summarize, the colony is on the verge of revolution, and the governor’s council sees independence as the only way to avert it. They have a plan : partition the Skræling Territory, and secretly sell off large amounts of state corporation stock to Scandinavian investors, along with giving Scandinavian political organizations free reign to operate within Vinland. Furthermore, they will do their utmost to keep as many Scandinavian loyalists in power as possible. This, they say, will preserve the maximum amount of Scandinavian influence within Vinland. They stress that a military solution is no longer feasible and have ended their petition with a desperate plea for the Scandinavian monarch to consider the plight of their “Vinlandic brethren.” Should we accept their request?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.A;Yes, a loyal republic is preferable to a homicidal one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.B;No, demand that they crush the traitors at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.T;The Independence of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.D;In a ceremony in Erikshavn, representatives of the Scandinavian Crown met with the new Vinlandic Provisional Council. They presented the Council with the royal charter that created the Crown Colony of Vinland, with the transfer of the charter representing the transfer of authority from the Scandinavian monarch to us. The Scandinavian and the Royal Vinlandic flags were then lowered for the final time, and the flag of the Vinlandic Republic raised, snapping into the wind above the new Presidential Office to cheering applause. Some, however, question if we are truly free of Copenhagen. While we are no longer royal subjects, Scandinavian money flows through the veins of Vinlandic commerce, and Scandinavian political organizations have put down roots in Vinland. Even the Vinlandic spirit of rugged individualism seems to have been tinged by Nordic communalism and aristocracy. Only time will tell what shape our new nation shall take, but one thing is clear : it will not be the shape which the Patrioter had envisioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.A;Enhed, retfærdighed, frihed (Unity, justice, freedom).;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.T;A New Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.D;The recent independence of the Vinlandic Republic has sent dominoes falling across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the political fervor, and as the new order permeates our own institutions, we are drifting into the orbit of Vinland more than ever before. For now, we have managed to forestall annexation, but the Vinlanders have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from Scandinavia. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, many Masgirlanders are uncertain whether to believe the rumors that Scandinavia’s loss of control over northeastern Arcadia is not as complete as the Vinlanders claim…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.A;We want to remain who we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.T;The Vinlandic Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.D;With the newfound independence of Vinland, the first order of business is to establish exactly what legal foundation the country shall rest upon. Though the nation’s status as a republic has been confirmed, many aspects of its laws are still up in the air. Many delegates seem to be separating out into four political camps : the liberals, the conservatives, the reactionaries, and the radicals. The group that manages to sway most of the convention to its side will gain tremendous power to shape the destiny of the new nation. §RIf a particularly extreme faction manages to come out on top, however, the resulting instability could topple the republic.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.A;Let us forge a strong foundation for our future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.T;The Question of the Voting System;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.D;The first major question to arise during debate was what form the Vinlandic voting system should adopt. Conservatives, fearful of a “mobocracy,” have stressed that only landowning men have the personal responsibility and resources to be trusted with the vote. Liberals scoffed at such “feudal” ideas but believed that there still should be certain qualifications based on wealth. Radicals, aghast at the mere suggestion of voting restrictions, demanded nothing less than universal male suffrage, arguing that democratic representation is the issue which drove Vinland to seek independence in the first place and that it would be both unethical and hypocritical to deny it to its citizens in turn. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.A;The conservative option of a land-based franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.B;The liberal option of a wealth-qualified franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.C;The radical option of a universal male franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.T;The Question of the Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.D;The next issue to arise during debate was the form of the Vinlandic upper house. As the organ of the legislature expected to have the greatest influence on lawmaking, its composition is of critical importance. The conservatives, continuing their previous theme, argued that a property-based allocation for the upper house is the only way to prevent the government from being overrun by populism. Liberals, scorning the notion of a “republican aristocracy,” laid out what they claimed was the fairest arrangement possible : two representatives per state of Vinland, giving each constituent part an equal voice. The radicals, however, argued that both ideas presented too many opportunities to silence the voice of the people, and believed that only a regularly adjusted population-based weighting, backed up by regular censuses, could truly reflect the Vinlandic popular will. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.A;The conservative option of a property-based allocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.B;The liberal option of the two-representative-per-state system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.C;The radical option of a population-based allocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.T;The Question of Native Enfranchisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.D;The next issue to arise during debate was whether to extend the franchise to native Vinlanders. The topic sparked sharp debate and inspired some rather acidic remarks from the less cosmopolitan delegates. The conservatives deployed manifold arguments against native suffrage, from racial science theories to denigration of the natives’ moral character, to disputing the citizenship of non-European Vinlanders, and all sorts of other defenses against the idea. On this topic, however, the liberals and radicals closed ranks. Vinland, unlike other Euro-Arcadian nations, has always seen closer racial integration between European and native peoples. Native Vinlanders, the liberals and radicals reminded the conservatives, fought in the Great Arcadian War against the Plantagenians, buoyed the Vinlandic economy for centuries, and were the ancestors of “many delegates in this room.” To deny them suffrage, they argued, would be an insult to history and the very essence of Vinland. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.A;To extend suffrage only to European-descended men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.B;To extend suffrage to all Vinlandic men, regardless of race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.T;The Question of Native Land Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.D;The next issue to arise during debate was how to address native lands within Vinland. Due to the complex ethnic makeup of Vinland, the topic has many implications for Vinland’s economic and societal future. The conservatives conceded that the natives should be able to petition the government for their lands but urged that this be qualified by guarantees that said natives would seek to better themselves and their lands, bringing both up to “civilized” standards. Liberals denounced the conservatives for “demanding that natives navigate legal mazes to secure their own homes,” and proposed to create a commission to review and process native land claims. Radicals, however, astonished even the liberals by demanding that native lands be placed under special jurisdiction to weigh elections in natives’ favor, and even allow native councils to pass ordinances to restrict or bar Europeans from entering! The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.A;The conservative option of voluntary land reclamation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.B;The liberal option of a commission to adjudicate native land claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.C;The radical option of extensive native rights measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.T;The Question of the Head of State;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.D;The last issue to arise during debate was what powers the head of state should receive. This was a contentious issue, as the role of the head of state is intimately connected to the form of the Vinlandic government writ large. The conservatives came out swinging, declaring that the only way to prevent Vinland from sliding back into chaos was to establish a centralized government with a strong President to unify the nation and provide consistent leadership. The radicals led the charge against such plans, denouncing them as “Caesarism-in-waiting.” They instead urged the convention to embrace a federal model with a purely ceremonial head of state, to keep power diffused across the government rather than concentrated in one place. The debate seemed to have split the liberals, and supporters for both proposals could be found on both sides, though a plurality of them favored the federal option. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.A;The conservative option of a strong President.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.B;The radical option of a ceremonial President.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.T;The End of the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.D;The Vinlandic Constitutional Convention has now concluded. All the delegates have signed the constitution, but in order to be ratified and thus enter force, it must be approved by the people. As the convention decided in one of their final votes, the constitution shall be put to a nationwide referendum on whether to adopt it. While many hope that such a process will be a mere formality, others worry that the delegates may have misjudged the national mood and deviated too far from what the average Vinlander will accept. Whatever the case, the answer will soon become clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.A;What does the voice of the people say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.T;The Liberal Constitution is Adopted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has passed, and the liberal constitution has been accepted by the Vinlandic people. Though some liberal delegates feared that they’d pushed too far at the convention, the document guaranteeing protections for personal liberties without extreme shifts in Vinlandic society has been met with general approval. Even better, the news of the liberal program being promulgated has shifted opinion in Masgirland decisively in favor of becoming the newest state of Vinland, and they have already petitioned for annexation! As Vinland strides forward into the future, it does so basking under the glow of liberty, equality, and fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.A;We have it in our power to begin the world over again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.T;The Conservative Constitution is Adopted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has passed, and the conservative constitution has been accepted by the Vinlandic people. Though some conservative delegates feared that they’d compromised too little at the convention, the document guaranteeing a republic founded on traditional Vinlandic principles has been met with general approval. Even better, the news of the conservative program being promulgated has been met with warm reception in Masgirland – so much so that they have already petitioned for annexation! As Vinland strides forward into the future, it does so as it always has : for God and for Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.A;Politics is a game requiring great coolness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.T;The Reactionary Constitution Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has been defeated, and the reactionary constitution rejected by the people. The document’s extensive restrictions upon personal liberties, and its establishment of a virtual “republican aristocracy,” met with widespread condemnation from an electorate which felt that the proposed constitution represented the very ideas that they’d been warring against for decades. Many former Patrioter members have abandoned the government in disgust, leaving a skeletal assortment of conservative and reactionary politicians in control. The provisional president was among those to leave, and so Vidkun Hammarskjöld, a historian by training and the scion of a wealthy Vinlandic merchant family, has been sworn in as President. His first act has been to declare the constitution “adopted by executive order,” compounding the sense of outrage across Vinlandic society towards the high-handed government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.A;I’m sure that he has a plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.T;The Creation of the Kingdom of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.D;Hammarskjöld is, foremost, a historian. He knows that republics have often proved weak and feeble in the long run, in contrast to monarchies. Ancient Greek and Roman history are replete with examples, to say nothing of the fate of republics in the Great German Wars. Thus, he decided, like Augustus once did, that the only way to save the republic was to destroy it. In an ornate ceremony, he was coronated Vidkun the First, King of Vinland, with his close friend Frederick Michelsen made his Chancellor. It was supposed to be a triumph, with most of Erikshavn expected to attend and even foreign dignitaries invited. This did not come to pass. Many people simply ignored the ceremony, and the only foreign dignitaries to arrive were a Burgundian author and his Incan attendant. The most painful part of the day came when Michelsen, standing before a crowd of a hundred or so diehard monarchists, requested them to acclaim their new sovereign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.A;Long live the King!...Please applaud. Please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.T;Chaos in Erikshavn;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.D;When the Vinlandic Republic was declared, most republicans thought that their mission was accomplished. News of Vidkun’s coronation, however, awoke fresh fury within them. Within days after the ceremony, street riots by angry Erikshavners have become a common occurrence. Wrathful broadsheets have been turning up across the city with such cheerful messages as exhortations to cast the new monarch into the Frysja River. Worst of all, Haakon Jensen, nephew of former Samfunn af Patrioter leader Johan Nielsson, has reactivated the Patrioter’s old network to create the Vinlandic Republikanske Brorskapet (Vinlandic Republican Brotherhood, VRB), and has called upon “all loyal and free Vinlanders” to rise up and destroy the “tyrant in our midst.” VRB militias wearing white-and-red Patrioter-style armbands have been spotted prowling the city, and law and order in Erikshavn is breaking down. If the first reports of VRB units springing up in other cities are any indication, all of Vinland is not far behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.A;How could they betray King Vidkun like this!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.T;The Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.D;Jensen, having learned from veteran paramilitary commanders, had little trouble taking advantage of the current chaos to secure men and weapons for the VRB. With many republican soldiers defecting to him, he soon felt confident enough to stage a coup. Using old plans for the seizure of the colonial government, VRB men deployed from their bases to seize transportation, communication, and military centers across Erikshavn, before Jensen and his most trusted comrades led a contingent to the royal palace. The Vinlandic military was able to hold the harbor, however, with significant consequences. Warned by a monarchist insider within the VRB, the King was able to evacuate along with the rest of the royal family and the chief government ministers before Jensen could capture them. They have now fled to Masgirland, last bastion of reaction, as the VRB rise up throughout the nation and Jensen organizes an Executive Council with himself as President to rule the restored Vinlandic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.A;We shall sooner welcome death than live as slaves! (Remain Vinland);;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.B;God save the King! §B(Play as Masgirland)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN41.T;The Radical Constitution Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN41.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has been defeated, and the radical constitution rejected by the people. The document’s tremendous changes to many traditional aspects of Vinlandic society alienated an electorate which felt that the proposed constitution did not reflect their values. The radicals, unfazed, declared that the “will of the people” would not be “suppressed,” and pronounced the constitution adopted despite the referendum’s result. Many conservatives have made baleful predictions that its terms will allow radicals to dominate the government. These fears were compounded when Vilhelm Schoultz, famous liberal extremist, easily won election as the nation’s Førstesekretær (First Secretary), the head of government. Although Schoultz has promised an equal voice for all Vinlanders, few believe him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN41.A;Those who sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither and will lose both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.T;The First Sitting of the Vinlandic Stortinget;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.D;”Order! ORDER!”\n\nAs the conservatives had feared, the radicals have bent quite a few laws in their favor. Multiple elections have allegedly been rigged under the guise of “ensuring full participation,” creating a radical near majority in the Stortinget. Even without voting fraud, radical candidates swept elections with populist programs and vast amounts of mudslinging. When reactionary SM Vidkun Hammarskjöld voted against a bill to ban state funding of religious organizations and Førstesekretær Schoultz ordered the stortingetformann (assembly chairman) to discard his vote, the entire room erupted into violence, with some older SMs shouting Patriot or Leifsson slogans. After the brawl subsided, conservatives staged a walkout, with Hammarskjöld denouncing Schoultz’s government as a sham and a dictatorship. Even some liberals have expressed disgust at the radicals’ “trampling” of democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.A;But, government is too important to be left to reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN43.T;Declaration of the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN43.D;”Vinland is now under siege by enemies foreign and domestic. To defend the nation, we have created the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité (Revolutionary Security Committee) and assumed the burden of governance. What is necessary now is terror, not as chaos, but as exceptional and revolutionary justice. If virtue is the spring of a popular government in times of peace, the spring of that government during a revolution is virtue combined with terror : virtue, without which terror is destructive : terror, without which virtue is impotent. The government in a revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.” - Grunnlovens Forsvarar Schoultz\n\nThe Vinlandic government has been overthrown in a self-coup by Schoultz’s radicals, with Schoultz becoming Grunnlovens Forsvarar (Constitutional Defender). Conservatives have fled to Masgirland, as the falløkser are raised up and the Tiden av den Røde dawns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN44.T;The Declaration of Masgirlandic Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN44.D;With Vinland submerged into revolutionary chaos, Masgirland has become the bastion of sanity and reason in north Arcadia. To avoid being swept up into the new monstrosity to our west, it has been decided to officially declare the independence of Masgirland. Founded in tradition and the resilience of our people, Masgirland will prevail against the madness of Erikshavn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN44.A;Masgirlanders never will be slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.T;A Deal With the Devil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.D;We have secured Masgirland’s existence as an independent state, but as things stand it will not stay that way for long. Even now, the madmen in Vinland are preparing to crush us – and nobody in Masgirland has any desire to be introduced to Fru Falløks (Madame Fall-Axe), their horrid name for those homicidal contraptions. Thus, some officers have approached His Majesty and his council with a proposal : request aid from Scandinavia. The advantages are obvious. Masgirland is a small and weak country, whereas Scandinavia is a great power. Their assistance would be a tremendous boon. However, the risks are also obvious. §RIf we allow Scandinavia an entrance back into power in Masgirland, let alone Vinland, it is highly likely that they will never leave – we stand a strong chance of being recolonized.§ But even so, it might be better than to meet our deaths by means of murderous machines amidst jeering crowds…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.A;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.B;Better to fight and die than to live and serve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.T;The Masgirlandic Plea;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.D;It seems that the situation in Nordic Arcadia is dire. Word has reached us that Vinland has been seized by a radical liberal regime, and the conservatives have retreated to Masgirland and declared an independent kingdom. However, Vinland will likely soon invade them…which is why they have turned to us. Masgirland has offered us significant economic and political concessions if we agree to defend them during the imminent Vinlandic invasion. Many of our officers have excitedly pointed out that, if we are successful, we could use this as a pretext to occupy and retake Masgirland, and potentially Vinland as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.A;We won’t come back ‘til it’s over over there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.B;The Masgirlanders have made their bed, and now they shall die in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.T;Scandinavia Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.D;We have received word that our former colonial overlords have agreed to protect us from the Vinlandic menace! Their ambassador seemed strangely distracted while delivering the news, as if he was taking note of certain parts of the city. Regardless, we shall not fight the Vinlanders alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.A;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.T;Scandinavia Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.D;We have received word that our former colonial overlords have refused to protect us from the Vinlandic menace! It seems that they blame us for not supporting them enough in the past to prevent the Vinlandic radicals from causing them to leave their Arcadian colonies in the first place. This bizarre logic aside, we must stand alone against Vinland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.A;Horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.T;The North Arcadian Brothers’ War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.D;When Vinland and Masgirland were founded, they were often referred to as the “Two Brothers” or the “Two Sisters,” for they were alike in parentage yet dissimilar in manner and composition. That term was once one of affection and unity. Now, it has become something else : a dark rumination on imminent fratricide. As the Vinlandic Revolutionary Army storms towards the reactionary bastion of Masgirland, the Masgirlanders fortify their communities and prepare for the onslaught. At stake is the ideological foundation of Nordic Arcadia, torn between the militant republicanism and liberalism of Vinland, and the rich traditionalism and anti-radicalism of Masgirland. Regardless of who prevails, the psychological wounds will echo across north Arcadia forever. There is about to be a death in the Nordic family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.A;Am I my brother’s keeper?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.T;Victory of the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.D;We have conquered! The Masgirlandic reactionaries stood no chance against the righteous armies of the Vinlandic Republic. As the remaining monarchists are ferreted out, we have decided to take strong measures to prevent any future resurgence of conservative Masgirlandic nationalism. Masgirland will be annexed, not as a single unit, but split into separate states within Vinland itself. All individuals currently holding political office in Masgirland will be turned out. Finally, the curriculum in the former Masgirland will be adjusted to support cultural unity with Vinland. We will secure, defend, and consolidate the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.A;Vinlandia invicta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.T;Victory over the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.D;God be praised! The rebels have been shattered by the righteous armies of our glorious King. As the remaining republicans are ferreted out, the royal family has returned to Erikshavn in triumph. His first act has been to declare the annexation of Masgirland into Vinland, albeit with protections for local autonomies. The people rejoice at the destruction of the barbaric usurpers and the restoration of the sovereign to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.A;And we didn’t even have to ask them to applaud this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.T;Victory over the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.D;Masgirland has triumphed! The insane Vinlandic radicals and their murderous leader could not stand up to a truly free and proud people willing to fight for their rights and their traditions. With the Vinlandic invasion force destroyed, the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité’s popularity has plunged precipitously and Schoultz is now in dire straits.  But while some conservatives express a desire to return home to Vinland as soon as the radical regime is deposed, others have decided to take up permanent residence in the land which they have stood for and fought for. The defeat of radicalism is the dawn of a new and free Masgirland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.A;Let freedom ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.T;The Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.D;The failure of our invasion of Masgirland has dealt a catastrophic blow to the regime. Where the people once were willing to forgive our more extreme actions in the name of liberation, now they denounce us as tyrants and demagogues who lied to the public to seize power. The Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité attempted to give a public address to rally support for our government, but during the speeches, a revolutionary guardsmen got into a struggle with some rock-throwing hecklers and accidentally discharged his rifle, shooting one dead. This highly visible killing led the already tense crowd to riot, spiraling into citywide violence. By nightfall, Schoultz and the rest of the Komité had been thrown into Elvemunning Prison by their own guards. A Provisional Council comprised of various non-radical politicians (albeit with a conservative bent) has been formed pending new elections, and the Komité will soon face trial for treason. Fru Falløks’ final victims may very well be her old masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.A;Like Saturn, the revolution devours its children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.T;The Lion Has Landed;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.D;With the war in north Arcadia over, Scandinavian officers across the area were awaiting the recall order to return home. Thus, all of them were surprised to receive new orders in circumstances of great secrecy by messengers they’d never seen before. Once received, however, they were unflinchingly obeyed. Soon, each Scandinavian unit marched on the nearest city, port, or military base, securing them in the name of the Scandinavian Crown. Across the area, the flags of Vinland have been torn down, and the Rigernes Banner hoisted in their place. With most of the country occupied, Scandinavian forces converged on Erikshavn, deposed the monarchy, and installed the new colonial governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.A;Guess who’s back, back again…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN55.T;The Restoration of the Dominion of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN55.D;In what can only be described as an act of divine providence, the destruction of the republican regime in Vinland by the Scando-Masgirlandic forces provided us with a golden opportunity to seize the whole nation. Our army is now in control of Vinland, and the people – having endured an incompetent and reactionary democracy, an equally incompetent farce of a monarchy, a violent insurrectionary republic, and a major war – seem to have accepted our return, at least for now. We shall likely need to address the Vinlandic Question again in the future but at this time Scandinavia has returned to Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

develop_frederikstad_title;The Vinlandic Metropolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
develop_frederikstad_desc;The island of Kongsberg, named for the hill overlooking the city of Frederikstad has seen great developments since the end of colonial rule. Works on the Frysja river has allowed ships to sail up to the island and the new Tekina canal allows them to circumvene the treacherous rapids located mere miles south of the city. The port of Frederikstad has thus become the new great port of Vinland, located between the Great Lakes, the capital and the Belgian cities through the new railways. While Erikshavn remains the political and cultural heart of the nation, everyone acknowledges that the industrial might will be born in Frederikstad where the immigrants are already flowing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_east_title;Eastern Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_east_desc;The situation in the south has now been settled, and we can at last turn our eyes towards the east. Several of the northernmost Belgian republics might find inclusion in our nation to be more amiable than rule from the callous southerners, and Plantagenia holds lands which are not easy to administer from all the way in Nouvelle Orleans. We shall relieve both nations of these territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_frontier_title;Western Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_frontier_desc;With immigrants continuing to arrive, and our infrastructure and medical technology advancing, we now have the ability to bring the wild lands of the west more firmly under our control. Vinlandic hunters and traders have long ranged across this area, but only now do we have the potential to actually govern them. Thus we should stake our claim to northern Arcadia, before another power can cut us off from our natural frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_removing_japan_title;Claim Hokkaigan;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_removing_japan_desc;Japan has long held Hokkaigan in their grip, a predator perched on the edge of Arcadia, menacing all around them. Qingqiu especially has suffered from their proximity to the Rising Suns Arctic outpost. There is also the fact that our nation lacks a western coastline, but if sufficient infrastructure could be developed, then we could construct a modern port in Hokkaigan. We must strike west and finish liberating the continent from Old World tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vinland_declares_intervention_title;Declare Opposition to a Cadien or Belgian Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vinland_declares_intervention_desc;The threat of Arcadian unification places Vinlandic sovereignty in doubt. At best, a united Arcadia would likely reduce us to their economic satellite. At worst, they could seek to seize Great Lakes territory from us, and possibly even other lands as well. We spent too much effort, sacrificed too many lives, thwarting the savage Arcadian Empire to see a new despot arise upon the continent! We shall issue an official proclamation denouncing the prospect of either a Cadien- or a Belgian-led Arcadian nation, and our intent to prevent such a monster from being created by force if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_SKR_title;Integrate the Skræling Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greater_vinland_SKR_desc;For centuries, we have coexisted with the Skræling. We have traded together, fought together, lived together, and labored together. Trade with the natives kept our colony alive : cooperation with their militias kept us independent from the Arcadian Empire. Yet after all this time, the Skræling “Territory” is still just a colonial remnant. It would be best for all parties if they were merged into our own nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_rohnnst_title;Integrate the Rhonnst People;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_rohnnst_desc;The Rhonnst are a combination of native, Nordic, and Asian cultural combinations, played out in countless variations. Their unique and fascinating culture possesses quite a few similarities to our own because of these connections. They represent the Vinlandic ideal of the best elements of the Old and New World joined together in harmonious equilibrium. By extending them full citizenship and protecting their rights and traditions, we shall strengthen our nation greatly – and shore up our defenses against Qingqiu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_SKR_title;Integrate the Skræling;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_SKR_desc;The “Skræling” are, in truth, a vast multitude of tribes across the Great Lakes, but what unites us is our shared history. We both originated as colonial subjects of Vinland, we both fought and bled together against Plantagenia, and we have both traded, worked, and lived amongst one another for centuries. The time has come to reward their aid and assistance by extending them full citizenship and protecting their rights and lands, integrating them into our national society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_sioux_title;Integrate the Sioux;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN_accept_sioux_desc;The Sioux are a fierce and proud people, who have often vexed the efforts of settlers to establish communities in the Great Plains. Rather than seek to wipe them out, as the brutal Cadiens desire to do, we should recognize the advantages of making such a strong culture loyal to us. By extending them full citizenship and protecting their rights and traditions, we shall strengthen our nation greatly – and shore up our defenses against Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFN_customs_union_title;Establish the Arcadian Customs and Monetary Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFN_customs_union_desc;The first step in bringing Arcadia together is to interlink our markets together. This system will be divided into two parts. The Customs Union will eliminate inter-union tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, while imposing a common external tariff on all goods entering the union. The Monetary Union will set the specifications of the Vinlandic gold and silver dalers as the basis of a common and freely exchangeable currency standard. It may take time to bring all member states fully into compliance, but it will greatly encourage free trade between our nations. More importantly, it will help popularize the notion of thinking of Arcadia as a single entity in the cultural, legal, and economic sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFN_council_title;Establish the Arcadian Community;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFN_council_desc;Our rising hegemony on the continent and the decline of both Belgium and Plantagenia has led to us being seen as the new standard bearer of pan-Arcadianism. To further the cause of Arcadian integration, we will establish a forum for political and security cooperation. This Arcadian Community will be governed by an Arcadian Council, with each member state represented within it. Furthermore, any person being a citizen of one member state shall be considered a citizen of all member states. The Community will also press for the adoption of the “Arcadian daler” as the standard currency of all member states, an evolution of the monetary union. Of course, with the Council being held in Erikshavn, we will maintain a certain amount of influence over it, as is proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both concepts were dismissed by Vinlanders as madness and folly, but they were founded on a noble ideal : the integration and unity of the continent. It fell to us to divine the true path, to bring ALL Arcadians, regardless of color or creed, into one family. Our economies and our political structures have now merged into one : we can no longer discern where one ends and another begins. We must all take the final step, and create an unbreakable and perpetual union, founded on principles of equality, justice, and common dignity. Now and forever, we shall be the Arcadian Union!

SPAN1.T;The Revolution of 1808 and its Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN1.D;For centuries, Spain built an empire on the exorbitant wealth it extracted from its colonies. This massive undertaking, however, had its costs. Beyond the tremendous economic and societal transformations, Spain developed a culture of conservative aristocracy backstopped by colonial wealth. In 1808, the liberal King José II usurped the Spanish throne and attempted to introduce long-overdue liberal reforms at home, as well as increasing colonial trade and the power of New World elites. The Dual Monarchy could not accept this and backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against José. After winning the brutal Peninsular War in 1815, Pedro reasserted liberalism and issued his own “Petrine Reforms.” They sharply curtailed colonial trade and reinforced the power of European-born elites, triggering the formation of the Columbian Alliance against us. The last few decades have not been kind to Spain, and if the increasing furor of Spanish liberals is anything to gauge things by, the next few decades may not be kind, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN2.D;The idea of Spain as a fractured nation is not new. It was felt in the 17th century, when Miguel Cervantes published The Ingenious Gentleman Dom Quixote de los Algarves, the famous story of a mad aristocrat returning to chivalry in a modern world. This well encapsulates the divide of our nation, between liberal and conservative, maritime and terrestrial, modernity and tradition…Spain and Castile. The eastern region of Castile has long chafed under the western centralization which came with the ascent of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty. Pedro III moved the capital to Madrid to reconnect with the neglected region, much to the anger of the west, yet even this may not have been enough. The liberals demand a return to Lisbon, and the reactionaries denounce this idea with equal fire and fury. Romantic poets have begun to speak of “Castile” as something unique and rooted in ancient ways. If Spain is to ever see true reform take root, the Castilian question will need to be answered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Both liberals and conservatives are claiming victory by interpreting the event through different lenses : the former as proof that the Lorena-Aviz dynasty and its allies are a millstone around Spain’s neck, the latter that the Spanish Empire will endure, in one form or another. Perhaps both are right. Public opinion of the Lorena-Avizes is no longer abysmal, but the liberals still feel emboldened in a way not seen since 1808. Seizing on the Crown’s moment of weakness, they have raised voices of protest across Spain, demanding the restoration of the Josephine Constitution. Reactionaries within the royal court are aghast at the notion, reminding the king that liberalism was what tore Spain apart during the dark days of the Peninsular War. Perhaps we could grant a revised and shortened version of it as a compromise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.A;We cannot dishonor the men who died for the royal cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.B;If it is the only way to prevent more fratricide…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.T;The Dumbfounded King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.D;King Afonso XV had felt reassured when he declared that there would be no restoration of the Josephine Constitution. After all, he told himself, he had resisted the demands of the liberals, and ensured that the memory of all the loyal conservative soldiers who had died in the Peninsula War would not be sullied by his own actions. Alas, it seems that others are not so sensitive to matters of historical memory. Massive protests have erupted across the nation, as liberals take to the streets to demonstrate their outrage towards the king – even Madrid was not spared violent unrest. When the King ordered the military to restore order, the generals decided that the time had come for the King to abdicate. After a stern conversation with a roomful of stone-faced officers, King Afonso signed a proclamation announcing his abdication and naming his young son Pedro as his heir, who shall reign as Pedro V. As the regency council announces sweeping democratic reforms, Afonso bids farewell to Madrid and to Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.A;Well, I’ve always wanted to spend time in Paris…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.T;The Lisbon Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.D;The collapse of the Spanish Empire in the New World, after so much blood and treasure had been sacrificed, has been a disaster for the Lorena-Aviz dynasty. Across Spain, liberals are denouncing the king and his court, calling for his immediate abdication. Some radicals have even demanded an end to the monarchy entirely! It is these extremists who have now acted. After several days of unrest in the city of Lisbon, the local military garrison attempted to come to the aid of the municipal government and restore order. This operation quickly collapsed, however, as soldiers began to be swayed by the liberals’ rhetoric and a mutiny scythed through their ranks. With soldiers defecting to the radicals, the city was soon overrun. All of Lisbon is now in the hands of these rebels, with famous author and jurist Teófilo Sales acclaimed as Provisional President of their Comitê de Segurança (Security Committee). This may be the burning wick which detonates the Spanish powderkeg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.A;This is a catastrophe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.T;The Toledo Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.D;With Lisbon occupied by militant liberals, a council of Spain’s most prominent military officers led by General Julio Segura has assembled in the city of Toledo. Declaring that the “current national situation” is “inimical to the continuation of the rule of law and public safety,” they have formed an “emergency council” to “protect the nation.” While they have ostensibly done this to prevent a radical revolution, many of them have publicly blamed King Afonso XV for not being more diplomatic and provoking this crisis in the first place. §RIf the king refuses to work with the junta, they are likely to become his most dangerous enemy.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.A;Just who or what are they “protecting?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.T;Anarchy Looms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.D;The seizure of Lisbon by radical forces, and the declaration of the Toledo junta, has polarized the nation. The royal government is rapidly ceasing to be able to function, as revolutionary sentiment spreads across western Spain, while the military and its conservative allies consolidate their position in the east. We find ourselves in the middle, and the situation is grim. Though surrendering to Sales’ revolutionaries is unthinkable, the rhetoric of Segura’s junta is not encouraging, either. The situation is rapidly approaching a point of no return and we are going to have to decide whether to trust the military devil we know or the revolutionary devil we don’t.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.A;Between Scylla and Charybdis lies Hispania…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.T;In the Palace of the King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.D;King Afonso XV and his court have run out of time, and must now make a decision on which faction to throw their weight behind. It may still be possible to placate the revolutionaries by reviving the plan of some of the king’s more moderate advisors to revise and reduce the Josephine Constitution and publish the resulting document as a royal charter of rights. Doing so might redeem the king in the eyes of more gulli – er, less committed revolutionaries, and allow him to harness the movement against Segura’s junta. He could also do the reverse, issuing a unilateral order to the Junta to head west and destroy the revolution. While this would certainly be the simpler move, and the one which would preserve the most royal power, it rests on the assumption that the junta would not seize the opportunity to accumulate even more power for itself by executing a coup. What is the will of the king?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.A;Publishing a royal charter is our only hope – make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.B;Let’s give this unwashed mob a whiff of grapeshot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.T;The Lisbon Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.D;The proclamation of the limited royal charter of rights has failed to placate the revolutionaries. A counter-proclamation has recently been issued from Lisbon, the de facto capital of the revolutionary movement, which denounces the document as a “pale substitute of liberty” and “a dishonor to the Spanish people!” Sales’ so-called Comitê de Segurança has presented a demand on behalf of the Spanish revolutionary movement : reinstate the Josephine Constitution, in full and without any alterations, or face a new civil war. Reactionaries within the royal court are outraged at the liberals’ ingratitude, and even some moderate conservatives are angered that they would reject such generosity on behalf of the sovereign. It seems that King Afonso must decide between destroying Spanish royal power or making war upon the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.A;Better a constitutional kingdom than no kingdom at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.B;The army will show these traitors the price of their impudence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.T;A Question of Capitals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.D;Now that the threat of civil war has been eliminated, a significant amount of wind has been taken out of the revolutionaries’ sails. Most of western Spain is now returning to law and order – most, but not all. The hardcore radicals have dug in within Lisbon, thought they are now reduced to demanding the return of the national capital to their city. They have made all sorts of arguments as to why this is necessary, which ultimately boil down to their fears of continued conservative domination if the capital remains in the east. Many conservatives have reacted with scorn to this proposal, sharply rebuking the liberals for daring to continue to make demands upon the sovereign after he has already graciously permitted such massive reforms. This may very well be the last significant decision which King Afonso personally makes in his capacity as head of state. Shall the capital return to Lisbon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.A;No, why would we give the traitors another reward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.B;Yes, it will simplify matters in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.T;The Lisbon Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.D;When General Segura and the rest of the Toledo Junta learned of the liberals’ intransigence regarding the capital, even after the king had restored the Josephine Constitution, they decided to finally take action to root out the would-be revolutionaries. Marshaling their forces, they descended upon the city determined to destroy the radicals – and destroy they did. Hundreds of people were shot down in the streets, with the liberals totally outgunned by the army. Sales himself was tried by a military tribunal, convicted, and hanged in front of the Cathedral of Saint Mary Major. Lisbon has been recaptured, but the death toll is staggering. Many wonder if this blood-soaked affair is a sign of things to come in Spain’s fragile new democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.A;An inauspicious beginning, to be sure…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.T;The Coup of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.D;When King Afonso ordered Segura to take decisive action against the revolutionaries, he obeyed – in a way. Decisive action was taken, but not against the revolutionaries. Instead, the junta concluded that the greatest danger to Spain was not the rebels in Lisbon, but King Afonso himself. Thus, they marched north to Madrid, their forces easily overwhelming the city garrison and reaching the royal palace. There they explained to Afonso that he and the rest of the royal family were to immediately abdicate and depart for the Dual Monarchy. Afonso attempted to protest, but the generals made it clear that they blamed him and his intransigence for creating the crisis and warned him that many revolutionaries would be angered at the notion of the Lorena-Avizes leaving Spain alive. By ensuring his family’s safe exile, they were already being quite merciful. King Afonso had no choice but to sign a pronouncement declaring his abdication, handing power over to the junta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.A;What shall they do with their newfound power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.T;The Spanish Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.D;When the Toledo Junta forced King Afonso to abdicate, many feared that Segura would seize all power for himself and ignite a war with the revolutionaries in the west. These pessimists were astonished when, instead, the Junta proclaimed its “investment and entrusting of all sovereign power” in the Lisbon rebels! The Comitê de Segurança quickly convened an assembly of representatives to establish a new government. What emerged from this legal crucible was nothing less than a republic – a constitutional, democratic republic, the likes of which have not been seen since the tumult which preceded the Great German Wars. Crowned heads across Europe feel the growing shadow of an enemy they thought long dead, as republicanism rises from the ashes. A revolution has been carried out at the edge of Europe, but surely its influence shall soon be made manifest across the continent – including the energizing of its enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.A;Like the sun upon the sky, we greet the rising of the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.T;The Matter of the Fueros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.D;For centuries, Castile and other parts of Spain have enjoyed a complex system of separate legal codes under the name of the “fueros.” When the Lorena-Aviz dynasty began to centralize more and more power towards the western coast of Spain, particularly around Lisbon, the fueros allowed the Castilians to resist their efforts and force the kings of Spain to accommodate to local realities. This system was brought crashing to the ground by King José II, who issued the Lisbon Proclamation in 1809 which destroyed the fueros in the name of modernizing Spanish law and administration. However, the victory of the Pedristas in the Peninsular War restored the fueros, and the Castilians have been using them to resist our attempts to centralize Spain. Our government is now considering whether to revive the Lisbon Proclamation and attempt once more to dismantle the fueros. Doing so would be a tremendous victory over the backwards, feudal nature of Spanish law, but would also outrage the Castilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.A;We must tear down this whole rotten system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.B;Abolition would be far too dangerous at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.T;Spaniards in Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.D;Our fair capital is no stranger to famous guests, but the new arrivals shocked even the most jaded Parisians : King Afonso XV of Spain, and most of the Lorena-Aviz royal family! He has quickly contacted the royal court, where we have learned the details of his overthrow. Afonso was quick to blame a sinister conspiracy between liberal extremists and traitorous army officers, who have now joined forces to seize Spain and proclaim a republic! Anglois reactionaries are apoplectic over the affair : Spain was one of our closest allies, not to mention a shining bastion of the Catholic faith. Its loss to the republican menace is a bitter blow to all of Europe. Now, many conservatives are demanding that we intervene in Spain to overthrow the liberals and reinstall Afonso, like our liberation of Spain from José II in the Peninsular War of 1808-1815. Of course, launching such a colossal war would destabilize Europe even further, and might invite our enemies to aid the Spanish Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.A;We shall destroy the revolution and save Spain like our forefathers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.B;A major European war would be horrendous, recognize the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.T;The Second Peninsular War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.D;For the second time in decades, the Dual Monarchy has declared war upon Spain, ostensibly its ally. It has done so as it did in 1808 : to destroy Spanish liberalism and restore a conservative to the throne. That they are doing so now to restore the recently ousted king, Afonso XV, rather than a mere pretender, matters little to the Spanish people. They are now bracing for yet more carnage, with General Segura and the dashing young Major-General Francisco Aguirre leading Spain into battle. Yet while the Spanish people once fought in the name of a king of their own, now they are doing so for new reasons. If you asked the more intellectual among them, they would speak of liberalism, republicanism, democracy, and the consent of the governed. They would speak of the ways in which the Lorena-Aviz dynasty has mired Spain in backwardness and repression, and how the Anglois have acted in concert with them. However, for the common Spanish citizen, the reason to fight is summed up in a single phrase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.A;Não passaram!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.T;Navarre Defies Us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.D;As part of our war effort against the illegitimate Spanish Republic, we had sent an envoy to Navarre to confirm that Anglois land and naval forces would be allowed passage through the country en route to Spain. This was expected to be a simple matter of transit, but it seems that the Navarrese have taken the opportunity to make some sort of absurd stand. Denouncing us as an “aggressive menace,” the Navarrese have refused to give our military passage! While much of the Anglois military is outraged by this affront, some members of the royal court have brought up the topic of the Plantagenets’ old claims to Navarre. This incident could give us the opportunity to “remind” the Navarrese of our claim, threatening to occupy and annex them if they do not obey us. §RWe should be cognizant that our neighbors, particularly Aragon, would be alarmed at such an ultimatum, and may take action to prevent us from conquering Navarre.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.A;We will not be bullied by a speck upon the map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.B;The mightiest nation in the world is above such pettiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.T;The Republic Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.D;Victory is ours! The Spanish Republic has endured the savage Anglois’ attempt to foist the Lorena-Aviz back onto the Spanish throne, and the Plantagenets have been publicly humiliated by their failure. Outplanned by the wise General Segurra, and outfoxed by the clever Major-General Aguirre, they have been forced to recognize our government and disavow the Lorena-Avizes. The world, which was shocked by our rise, has now been astonished by our prevailing over the Anglois menace : liberals throughout the world shall surely be inspired by our mighty example. The republic’s victory has won the trust of many Spaniards, who are now cautiously willing to have faith in Spain’s new democratic experiment. The monarchist cause lies in ruins as liberalism continues to advance, leading Spain into modernity. Perhaps the blood which we have spilled together as one people shall consecrate our efforts to reforge Spain into a free and united nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.A;Like Athens against Persia, democracy has defeated tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.T;L’humiliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.D;To the confoundment of the entire Anglois military, we have failed in our efforts to cast down the Spanish Republic. Due to our inability to defeat the liberal menace, the Lisbon regime has forced us to the negotiating table. In the resulting peace treaty, we have been forced to recognize them as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom of Spain, and publicly disavow Afonso and the rest of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty. The Lorena-Avizes are already preparing to leave for Plantagenia, but for us there can be no flight into exile to flee from our failures. There is only an uncertain future, with a liberal republic at our doorstep…and its wretched example giving inspiration to legions of traitors and separatists in both England and Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.A;Merde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.T;A Catástrofe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.D;The republican dream has perished beneath the onslaught of Anglois shot and cannonade. The wicked alliance of Anglois and Spanish monarchists scythed through the countryside, butchering all who resisted them, before descending with rapine and slaughter upon Lisbon, brutally sacking the city. General Segurra was merely forced into retirement, but Major-General Aguirre was executed by the Anglois. Throughout the nation, anyone remotely associated with anti-republicanism has taken the opportunity to settle personal scores against any liberal, knowing that the occupiers would shield them. The result has been a cascade of violence and internecine warfare, as village after village attempts to purge itself of the “traitors” in its midst. The Dual Monarchy cares not for the carnage they have caused, only for the treaty by which the war was ended. Said treaty placed Afonso back on the throne and confirmed the fueros, while transferring multiple colonies to Anglois rule as payment for their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.A;Os fortes fazem o que querem e os fracos sofrem o que devem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.T;The Dual Monarchy Pursues Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.D;In order to prevent a conservative uprising, which may have occurred had King Afonso and the Lorena-Aviz family been executed (as some radicals wished), the Toledo Junta instead allowed them to go into exile in the Dual Monarchy. Many liberals feared that this would lead the Dual Monarchy to attempt to restore Afonso to the Spanish throne. Thankfully, this has not occurred. An Anglois diplomatic envoy arrived in Lisbon today, bearing official documents which recognized the Spanish Republic as the legitimate successor to the Kingdom of Spain, and which formally opened diplomatic relations between our governments. It seems as though the “Anglois Menace,” so hated by radical republicans, will leave us be for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.A;The Anglois lion sleeps tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.T;The Future of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.D;In one way or another, Spain has been reunified – in theory. The aversion of civil war has only been the first step in the journey towards national healing. What is needed now is a comprehensive review of Spanish society, and the government’s role within it. Politicians and writers across the nation have begun fighting battles of words and ideas, each seeking to advance their own plans for the revival of Spanish fortunes. Whichever set of voices win out and make themselves heard above the din shall decide the fate of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.A;À frente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.T;The Decline and Fall of the Madrid Economy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.D;With Lisbon’s reinstatement as the Spanish capital, Madrid has seen its prospects plummet. Less than a century ago, Madrid was little more than a royal hunting lodge, an appendage of Toledo. It was only Pedro III’s efforts to move the capital eastwards and reject the coastal establishment, and the necessary reorienting of the bureaucracy, which drew any sort of prosperity to Madrid. Now that even this is gone, the city has suffered an abrupt economic decline. Every day, more people are leaving the city for good, moving to Lisbon or some other, more prominent city. Shops are closing by the dozen, merchants are deserting the city, and nearly all manifestations of foreign capital are vanishing. For those who remain – the Castilians who have called Madrid home for centuries – the sharp pain of the economic loss only compounds their bitterness, and their sense of being used by the uncaring elite of the coast. Some Castilians have even called for the easterners to “reclaim” Madrid as their own symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.A;I never liked Madrid much, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.T;The Monopolization of Land in Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.D;Despite recent depredations upon the Spanish population, as well as substantial colonial migration in the days of the Empire, the lands of our nation have not wanted for lack of tenants – quite the opposite. Many communities can no longer acquire the land which they need to survive, dependent as they are upon a mostly rural lifestyle of farming and herding. A significant contributor to this problem is the vast amounts of land held by the Catholic Church. Centuries of pious Spaniards willing their lands to the Church, as well as the Church’s own efforts to consolidate holdings around its many monasteries, has led to the Church controlling an outsized percentage of land in Spain. The Church, obviously, does not pay taxes, which means that our treasury is also left wanting. The matter is beginning to rise to national debate, as liberals decry this “ecclesiastical hoarding,” and even pragmatic conservatives question if our arrangements with Rome may need alteration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.A;A solution will have to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.T;Nationalization of Church Land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.D;Many Spanish liberals have concluded that the simplest way to deal with the church land is to seize it. Leading anti-clerical jurists have made a strong case that there is in fact no law which forbids the Spanish government from nationalizing most Spanish lands held by the Catholic Church. The arguments for doing so are numerous. By seizing and then selling off the land to small landowners, we would cultivate the creation and growth of a Spanish middle class not confined to urban centers, and one which would use the land far more efficiently than the monasteries ever have – or so the liberals claim. The Spanish treasury would also greatly benefit from selling these lands off to future taxpayers, and the local aristocrats would be pleased at a chance to weaken the Church, their eternal rival. Conservatives are, of course, disturbed by the idea, but some concede that it may be financially necessary. Of course, if we go through with this, it is likely that the strongest protest will come from Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.A;Jesus lived among beggars, surely monks can as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.B;And consign our souls to Hell? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.T;Arrival of the Papal Legate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.D;News of the Spanish government’s imminent nationalization of church land has caused His Holiness the Pope to take action. A Papal legate has arrived in the capital, with an urgent message for our government. The Holy Father, he explains, is greatly unnerved at our plans to confiscate most Spanish ecclesiastical lands. Rather than immediately denounce us, however, the Pope wishes to arrange a meeting between himself and our top officials to attempt to come to some sort of agreement. While His Holiness would of course prefer that the matter of ecclesiastical confiscation was entirely dropped, he is aware of the dire state of Spanish finances. Thus, he might be willing to accept such a move if certain political concessions were made towards the Catholic Church in return. Doing so would be seen as a betrayal of liberal principles by some, but it could avert further political strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.A;Dismiss the legate, and enact the confiscations as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.B;We will attend a meeting in Rome for negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.C;This was a mistake, cancel the confiscations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.T;Quanta Cura;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.D;“When all restraints are removed by which men are kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to evil, propels them to ruin. Experience shows, even from earliest times, that cities renowned for wealth and splendor perished because of them becoming wholly overwhelmed and subsumed by the endless desire for further agglomeration. This impulse, this drive towards amassment not because of thrift and sagacity in pursuit of magnanimity, but as an end in and of itself, is born not from Almighty God, but from the false idols which His prophets rightfully condemned.”\nIn reaction to the Spanish ecclesiastical confiscations, the Pope has published a new encyclical, Quanta Cura (Condemning Current Errors). It is a withering criticism of our actions, equating secularism with greed and vanity. Catholic intellectuals across Europe have begun echoing his condemnations, to our detriment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.A;Surely nobody actually believes this drivel…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.T;An Audience with His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.D;The most powerful and influential members of our government have met with the Holy Father in a secretive meeting in Rome, in order to discuss the issue of ecclesiastical confiscations. As the negotiations progressed, it became clear that the Pope was willing to allow them to occur, but only if we could provide some tangible demonstration that we did not intend to use them as the opening wedge to destroy Catholicism in Spain. Further discussion drifted towards one particular idea : enshrining Catholicism as the state religion. Though previously taken for granted, the status of the Church has been the subject of fierce debate lately. Such a vivid and permanent gesture on our part would go a long way towards allaying the Pope’s fears. Naturally, doing so would outrage and disgust most liberals, who have an extremely low opinion of the entire Church and would abhor making such a concession to obtain what was supposed to be a measure to greatly weaken its influence in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.A;Spain is a Catholic nation and we shall not deny it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.B;Try to concoct a maze of meaningless prose to satisfy him instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.T;Immortale Dei;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.D;”The Almighty has appointed the charge of the human race between two powers, the ecclesiastical and the civil, the one being set over Divine, and the other over human things, with each having their fixed limits. But just as it might come to pass that one and the same thing might belong to the jurisdiction and determination of both, therefore God, who foresees all things, and who is the author of these two powers, has marked out the course of each in right correlation to the other. Jesus Christ has Himself given command that what is Caesar's is to be rendered to Caesar, and that what belongs to God is to be rendered to God.”\nOur meeting with His Holiness the Pope ended badly. The Pope, upset by our attempts to outfox him, published an encyclical, Immortale Dei, condemning secularism and its encroachment upon the Church. While it does not call out our government explicitly many Catholics have interpreted it as a public statement of Papal displeasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.A;How ungrateful of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.T;The Spanish Concordat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.D;In a diplomatic coup which would go down in history if our negotiators had the freedom to speak their full minds on the matter, we have satisfied the Pope’s wishes without actually giving up anything of importance. A diplomatic agreement has been concluded between us and the Holy Father in which the role of the Catholic Church within several aspects of Spanish civil society has been reaffirmed. Nowhere in said document, however, have we stipulated that the Catholic Church is in any way bound to the state, or that the state is unquestionably obligated to support it. While Catholics across Europe hail the Concordat as a victory for the faithful, we know that it is in truth merely a way to keep the Pope at arms’ length from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.A;And His “Holiness” is none the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.T;The Jimena Chronicles;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.D;Castilian historian Alberto González has published a controversial new book, “The Jimena Chronicles.” Current scholarship holds that Spain was weak until the House of Lorena-Aviz took the throne in the early fifteenth century and brought it glory. González has argued instead that the Jimenas, who ruled Castile-Leon (later Spain) from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, deserve the credit. It was Afonso VII de Jimena, he argues, who first claimed the title of “Emperor of Hispania,” and the Jimenas’ greatest rivals were the Portuguese. He then compares archaeological data of the standard of living in Spain, particularly in Castile, during the Jimena and the Lorena-Aviz eras. He argues that while the Jimenas maintained a good standard of living across Spain, the Lorena-Aviz dynasty saw wealth drain away from the interior towards the coasts. The book intimates that the Portuguese usurped Spain to subordinate Castile’s resources for themselves. If we don’t censor this work soon, we may soon hear it quoted across Castile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.A;Censorship is illiberal, but in this case may be needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.B;What harm can one book, from TOLEDO of all places, do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN31.T;The Asturian Trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN31.D;A recent incident in Asturias has demonstrated the extent to which the fueros still influence our nation. Rafael Luis de Jovellanos, an Asturian and formerly the Spanish treasurer, was recently charged with embezzling the government, classified as treason in Spain, but successfully filed a change of venue from Lisbon to Oviedo. His reasoning was that he, a reactionary and former Alfonsista, would not receive a fair trial in “radical” Lisbon. This proved disastrous – Jovellanos was easily able to find a man to use the Asturian fueros to sabotage the prosecution. His defense attorney, Xuan Casona, employed shocking legal chicanery to win the case. After getting a considerable amount of evidence thrown out since it was not collected according to Asturian laws, Casona was able to have Jovellanos acquitted. The whole case has made a mockery of Spanish law and has infuriated liberals, who see the entire Spanish judiciary as infected with reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN31.A;Why did the judge permit this travesty!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.T;The Matter of the Fueros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.D;The recent acquittal of former treasurer Rafael de Jovellanos due to loopholes in Asturian law has enraged much of western Spain. Liberals from Porto to Cadiz are apoplectic, infuriated that a few feudal laws and (they allege) corrupt connections were able to subvert Spanish justice. Many are demanding a retrial, but under the Asturian fueros, to try Jovellanos again for the same crime would be illegal. However, due to treason being a federal offense, the government could appeal the ruling and seek to bring the case to the Spanish Supreme Court. If Jovellanos were to then be convicted, said conviction could then be used to declare the fueros themselves contrary to national law. This would have colossal ramifications, but could inspire massive resistance from places like Asturias and Castile which have clung to the fueros for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.A;A retrial is clearly needed, but the fueros can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.B;The time has come to tear down the whole rotten system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.T;The Castilian Courts Suggest a Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.D;Jovellanos’ case, once brought to the Supreme Court, rapidly fell apart – the government was able to bring the full weight of its evidence to bear against him and secure a conviction of treason. He will soon wear the hangman’s necktie, but the Castilian courts were alarmed by the ways in which the Supreme Court’s verdict seemed to be an indictment of the fueros. They realized that allowing such a statement by the Supreme Court to go unchallenged could enable the national government to destroy the fueros. Now some of the most famous Castilian jurists and legal scholars, led by Felipe Gullón Serrano, head of the University of Valladolid School of Law, have drafted a manifesto to the government. It suggests transforming the fueros into a modern form of structured autonomy, allowing regions like Asturias and Castile to keep certain rights while closing loopholes such as those employed by Jovellanos. Following this plan might curb separatism but would entrench the essence of the fueros within Spain’s laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.A;Discard the manifesto, and pass the bill ending the fueros!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN330.T;The Birth of Castilian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN330.D;“¡Yo soy un Castellano! Castilla es un nacion! (I am a Castilian! Castile is a nation!)”\n\nEight words encompass the radical transformation which has taken place in eastern Spain over the last few decades. Ideas of identity based on language, culture, geography, and tradition have finally fused with longstanding economic, political, and religious grievances among the easterners. The concerted effort to identify a unique Castilian language and ethnicity within the historical lands of the Crown of Castile-Leon have been the final step of the emergence of a Castilian identity. Enraged by the unrelenting centralism of Lisbon, these Castilian nationalists are pushing for unprecedented amounts of Castilian autonomy, with many demanding independence. §RThis is an existential threat to Spain. If it is not addressed, then we will be torn apart, and perhaps even disintegrate like the Cordoban caliphate did in the time of the Reconquista.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN35.T;The New Spanish Railway Network;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN35.D;With the development of locomotive technology in Spain, the government has convened a panel of engineers and scientists to determine the optimal layout of the new Spanish rail system. The most pressing issue is which region to prioritize. While the entire nation will hopefully be joined together by rail at some point in the future, our resources are limited and so we should consider which part of the nation would benefit the most from being the first to receive this new infrastructure. Most liberals feel that Lisbon, and the western coast in general, is the natural first step in the interconnection of Spain. This would bring even more prosperity and efficiency to an already developed region, but a vocal minority have pointed out that rail technology would be a great aid to the chronically neglected inland regions. This has proven a thorny topic, as those who have advocated for prioritizing the east have been accused of being Castilian nationalists plotting to undermine the rest of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN35.A;Trains shall pull the east into modernity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN35.B;Let us bring trains to enlightened people, not ignorant farmers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN36.T;Formation of the Liga Castellana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN36.D;Castile has continued to chafe under Spanish rule. The rise of Castilian nationalism, and the desire to promote their cause, has led Castilian historian-turned-politician and author of the (in)famous “Jimena Chronicles,” Alberto González, to form the Liga Castellana (Castilian League). This group seeks the restoration of the medieval Crown of Castile as an autonomous kingdom within Spain, as well as the defense of the fueros and the preservation of traditional land rights from private speculators. The Liga has avoided advocating immediate independence – at least for now – but they have heartily endorsed Castilian nationalism, and their entrance into the mainstream political consciousness has in turn further spurred the ongoing Castilian cultural revival. Plays, books, and songs in the Castilian language have become symbols of the Liga, and González has even begun to give presentations on Castilian culture in foreign universities! If we do not solve the Castilian question soon then the Liga may become dangerously powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN36.A;It’ll never catch on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.T;Entrenchment of Castilian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.D;“Ten years ago, at the gate of Peñafiel Castle, my fellow Castilian patriots and I swore an oath that we would not rest until the reality of the Castilian nation was acknowledged. In those ten years, Castile has risen from the ashes. Not just in the hills and valleys, but in towns and cities, Castilians are reclaiming their fatherland.” - Alberto González\n\nThe Liga Castellana celebrated its tenth anniversary today, and its popularity continues to grow. The increasing urbanization of Castile has led to a reaction among middle- and lower-class Basques, Castilians, and Galicians against the Portuguese upper classes of the west, who own many new businesses and factories across Spain. These groups have found a shared cause in romanticizing the Jimena dynasty and the medieval era of northern Spain, and in defending their fueros and traditional Catholicism. Basque, Castilian, and Galician nationalist groups influenced by the Liga Castellana are becoming a regular sight in the cities beyond Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.A;Castile remains Spanish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.T;La Confederación Nacional del Trabajo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.D;Basque, Castilian and Galician labor unions have all been experiencing both government repression and alienation from more traditional, Spanish-dominated groups. At the same time, the dominance of landlords across the south has kept most small farmers and herders from owning much land, instead forced into wage slavery. Privatization of communal lands has exacerbated this to the point that many southerners have moved to the north in desperate search of work. Now a new organization has arisen which seeks to unite all four communities against the western elites. Known as the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, the CNT aims to organize urban workers in the north and rural workers in the south under a single union. Steeped in Blanquism, they wish to own the means of production and to redistribute land from landlords to the people. They have already made enemies across the upper class, and are alleged to be indoctrinating their members to form armed militias to defend workers against the “bourgeoisie” and their agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.A;Red lunatics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.T;Formation of Acción Nacional;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.D;A new group, the Partido de Acción Nacional (National Action Party), combines revolutionary collectivism with xenophobia. It is led by Sancho Zabalbeascoa (born Sancho Vázques), a Leonese lawyer who claims descent from Basque nobles who settled in the west during the Reconquista. In his manifesto, “Esketa” (Awakening), Zabalbeascoa asserts that the “pure Vasco-Castilian race, untainted by Moorish or Jewish miscegenation” unlike the “Afro-Semitic barbarians of the west,” is the “sole rightful inheritor of Iberia.” Declaring that the northern Iberians were the only ones to “remain unconquered, standing firm in our homeland, always true to our Catholic faith,” he has called for the “annihilation” of “liberalism, Protestantism, centralism, international capitalism,” and “all the other poisoned fruit of the maketo." He calls for a return to the countryside and the liberation of its people from “their cosmopolitan enslavers." AN’s paramilitary wing, the Black Eagles, have engaged in violent brawls with political rivals across Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.A;What is this new and dark ideology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.T;The Castilian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.D;The victory of the proletariat over the bourgeois is not yet complete. While we have mostly destroyed the enemies of the people in the west, in the east the old masters of capital have entrenched themselves amongst the hereditary reactionaries of Castile. Here, in this land of churches, manors, and aristocrats, the virulent strain of reaction has infected vast swaths of the region. Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the old fetters of society as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to delay the inevitable victory of the working class. Every day, loyal defenders of the proletariat report new acts of sabotage, wrecking, and other despicable treason against the people by this Castilian reactionary scum. It is corroding the entire machinery of the party, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.A;Death to all enemies of the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.T;The Castilian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.D;As we consolidate the National Rejuvenation, we must face its internal enemies. None of these are more prominent than the Castilians. For decades, these despicable parasites have feasted upon the wealth of the very nation which they scorn and dare to pretend is not their own. Their priests and lords fill the minds of their people with all manner of traitorous lies. Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the enemies of the people as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to prevent the final victory of the true sons and daughters of Spain. Every day, loyal defenders of Hispania report new crimes which bring dishonor to the Spanish people. It is becoming an epidemic, plaguing our whole national body, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.A;We must find a solution to this Castilian problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN42.T;Conservatism in the New Republican Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN42.D;With the abolition of the monarchy, new ideas of republicanism and secularism have gained national prominence. Predictably, the consolidation of the national government and culture under these new ideas has angered and frightened conservatives. They pine for the days of their fathers, of churches and crowns, and though this may sound like pathetic fantasy to some, they are still politically influential. Furthermore, the republican character of our new nation has disturbed the Castilians of the east, who note with growing alarm the ways in which we are dismantling the old monarchist regime. They are well aware that their unique codes and laws were inexorably tied to the crown : its loss places them in jeopardy. We have freed Spain from autocracy, but we must remain vigilant, for republics never want for lack of Catilines and Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN42.A;The light of liberty shall never be extinguished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.T;The Autonomy Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.D;A measure has recently come before the national legislature which seeks to address the increasing unrest in eastern Spain. Known as the “Autonomy Bill,” it would expand and empower regional governors across Castile. Proponents of the bill argue that it would allow the Castilians to exercise internal freedom without resorting to more drastic partitions of the nation, and that it would reduce the risk of autocratic measures being imposed unilaterally from Lisbon. Of course, most of western Spain is adamantly opposed to such a measure, with one Portuguese politician describing it as “drawing the diagram of cuts of meat upon the Spanish bull.” A few moderates have proposed to amend the bill to expire in a year and require renewal to continue, at which point we could simply allow it to lapse, but even this would be seen by the Castilians as a knife in the back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.A;Pass the bill as it is, we need a solution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.B;Pass the bill with the amendment, this is already dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.T;Castilian Nationalists Rally in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.D;The Autonomy Bill, even after its passage, has inflamed Castilian nationalists across Spain. Unsatisfied with the measure, which they deem a mere distraction from Castilian independence, they have converged on $CAPITAL$ to demonstrate the strength and popularity of their movement and put pressure on the government. From across the east, Castilian activists, politicians, and patriots have gathered in $CAPITAL$ in a massive display organized by multiple Castilian political organizations. The event energized their opposition as well, with many hecklers and counter-demonstrators arriving to denigrate the Castilians and show their Spanish patriotism. The resulting unrest and sensational news coverage has further invigorated the Castilian cause, and many unitarians are now calling for a nationwide crackdown on the Castilian nationalist movement to prevent it from growing out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.A;What we need are events to rally Spanish unity, not division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,              
SPAN44.B;Yes, let’s curtail this radicalism at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.T;Proliferation of Militias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.D;Castilian nationalist organizations have existed in the east for some time now, but they have now moved from activism to preparing for armed struggle. Government agents in the east have documented not only Castilian independentists, but Asturian and Galician nationalists as well as community self-defense groups in the south, attempting to acquire weaponry and even uniforms for paramilitary groups. We have tried to disrupt them wherever possible, but the deteriorating state of law and order in eastern Spain has led to militias also appearing to “defend their communities.” It is difficult to distinguish between those which are forming to enforce the law and those which are forming to resist the national government. Most of these groups are local in scope, while the larger ones compete with one another. If anybody managed to unify them, however, then they could pose an existential threat. The rise of these militias has cemented the feeling across Spain is that §Rthe point of no return has been passed. Civil war may now be inevitable…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.A;They are mere criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.T;Massive Desertions in the Spanish Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.D;The consolidation of armed resistance and the spread of separatist sentiments has sundered the army along cultural lines. Many Castilian, Asturian, and Galician units of the Spanish Land Army have disintegrated for want of manpower. Soldiers have abandoned their posts in droves, either to fight for an insurrectionary movement pretending to be a nation, or simply to return home and protect their communities – or, for southerners, to finally take revenge against their landlords. While we might be able to draw back some of the latter type of deserters in the long term, for now our military is in total disarray and we will have to accept that we must fight for Spain with little organization or cohesion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.A;Another cross to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN460.T;Ill Omens;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN460.D;A mood of frightful tension has descended upon Spain. From the largest cities to even remote villages, there is a sense that all the old laws of political conduct and conflict are about to burst like a dam, to flood the nation with violence. Even the military is not safe from rumors. So far, only a handful of the most notorious separatist fanatics have deserted their posts, but many Castilian, Asturian, and Galician soldiers can be heard whispering or grumbling about the aspirations of their homeland, while southerners mutter darkly of their oppressive landlords. We will face the future with a sufficiently united armed forces, come what may…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN460.A;…but not with a united soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.T;Formation of the Guarda Nacional;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.D;To uphold law and order as Spain slides into discord, we have formed an emergency paramilitary unit to assist local law enforcement. The Guarda Nacional will act to suppress separatist forces within our provinces, targeting anti-government militias. The Guarda Nacional will answer directly to the head of government and his cabinet, for the sake of efficiency, and will possess broad powers of investigation and internal autonomy. Some question if the establishment of this group may harm civil liberties but given the sheer scale of the national emergency many are just happy to know that the government is taking decisive action against the threat of sabotage, infiltration, and insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.A;May honor be their badge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.T;Proclamation of the Junta of Biscay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.D;“We, the Cantabrian inheritors of the east, endured against the Moors when all the rest of Iberia was in darkness, and rallied the crusaders to drive out the Afro-Semites of the west in the name of God. Now we call upon our sons and daughters to once again defend our fatherland. For the sacred Cantabrian cause, Spain must perish!” – The Biscay Proclamation\n\nThe emergence of an eastern middle class of landowners and urbanites and an upper class of industrialists has fed nationalist myths of a “Cantabrian race” and more broadly petit-bourgeoisie reaction. Now Asturo-Basque general Rubens Mascarenhas has led a clique of officers to seize the northeast, styling himself “Lord of Biscay” after the medieval Basque señorío and demanding the dissolution of the nation! Many soldiers have already defected to the junta - §Rthe sundering of Spain has begun.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.B;¡Viva el Señorío de Vizcaya! §B(Play as the north)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.T;Galicia Defects to the Junta of Biscay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.D;Galicia is often seen as a second Portugal, a copy of its southern counterpart. This may have been true last century, but no longer. Galician nationalists seeking to glorify Galician history and culture have harnessed the resentment which many Galicians feel towards Lisbon and the other prosperous cities of the southwestern coast, finding common cause with the separatist alliance in the northeast. Now a group of Galician officers have mutinied and seized the whole region in General Mascarenhas’ name! The traitors in Biscay have welcomed them with open arms and our control over northern Spain has well and truly collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.A;Você também, meu filho, sentirá o gosto do poder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN50.T;Galicia Declares Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN50.D;“Ours is an ancient land, old when Rome was born. Some have called us, ‘Little Portugal,’ but we are slaves of nobody! Galicia belongs only to herself. From us Portugal arose. Now it is Spain, overtaken by Portugal, from which we liberate ourselves.” -  The La Coruña Declaration\n\nGalicia is often seen as a second Portugal, a copy of its southern counterpart. This may have been true last century, but no longer. Galician nationalists seeking to glorify Galician history and culture have harnessed the resentment which many Galicians feel towards Lisbon and the southwest. A group of Galician officers and politicians in La Coruña have now crowned local Count Diego Amancio de Gondomar as Duke of Galicia! Galician soldiers are already defecting to him and our control over the north has collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN51.T;Proclamation of the Democratic Junta of Seville;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN51.D;”For too many generations, we have been prisoners within our own homeland. Like slaves we have toiled for those who have stolen the lands of our people, bleeding and dying for taxes without mercy and wages without substance. No more! The hour of our freedom and dignity, and the death of servitude, is at hand.” – The Seville Proclamation\n\nSouthern Spain, especially Andalusia, has been plagued by land privatization forcing peasants and herders to pay exorbitant rents or work temporary jobs for the smallest wages imaginable. Now, rural “captains of the people'' have formed councils across the towns and villages of the south, backed by deserting soldiers turning their guns upon the hated landlords. They have been organized by charismatic farmer and horse trainer Raul Pinto, whose message of anti-monarchism and rural land reform has electrified the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN52.D;“The situation in Castile can no longer be tolerated. In this time of extreme circumstances, it becomes necessary to assume authority to take the necessary measures to defend the Castilian nation.” – The Toledo Proclamation\n\nWith chaos consuming the north, certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Ruben Guerrero congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. There they have formed a new military council and have ceased to refer to the Spanish nation in preference for the “Castilian nation.” Rumors abound as to their intentions, but Spanish liberals all agree that this is a catastrophic development which likely signals the end of democracy in Spain and the start of something different, dark, and brutal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN53.T;The Second Toledo Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN53.D;”In that sacred hour, so many years ago, a collection of honorable men came together to safeguard the rights of the people against both anarchy and despotism. Now, on that same hallowed ground, we shall make a new stand for our nation, our Castile.” – Pronouncement of the Second Toledo Junta\n\nWith chaos in the north, certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Ruben Guerrero congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. Emulating the efforts of another clique of officers years ago, they have formed a new military council and have made fiery speeches extolling Castilian nationalism. Rumors abound as to their next moves but Spanish liberals all agree that the sundering of Spain is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN53.A;¡Não essa merda de novo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.T;Declaration of Castilian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.D;“To the people of Castile and to all the peoples of the world. Justice and the rights of man, irrevocable foundations which sustain the historical, legal, and institutional traditions of Castile, are the basis of the foundation of the Castilian Republic. The Castilian nation, its language and culture, has a thousand years of history. For centuries, Castile has maintained and run its own institutions in complete self-governance…The founding of the Castilian Republic comes from the necessity to protect the freedom, culture, and honor of all the citizens of Castile and responds to the obstruction on the part of the Spanish State by exercising the right of the people to withdraw their consent from their government.” – Declaration of Castilian Independence\nThe worst fears of western Spain have been realized : the Toledo Junta has declared an independent Castilian republic. The Spanish administration is being driven out of the east and our nation will soon be shattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.A;No declaration has taken place, because that would be illegal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.T;The Fall of Madrid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.D;The Toledo Junta wasted no time in besieging Madrid. The city’s defenders attempted to halt them, but many defected to the junta and resistance soon collapsed. The junta marched on the royal palace, but the king and the royal family had already escaped to Lisbon. Undaunted, General Guerrero declared himself the leader of the new Castilian provisional government, announcing that a council of Castilian politicians would soon be convened to lay the “nation’s” legal foundation. Bewilderment and outrage is the best description of western Spain’s reaction. Many who had previously disdained the monarchy have rallied to the national banner out of righteous indignation at this blatant coup, but perhaps this support has come too late. The Spanish government is crumbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.A;And the House of Lorena-Aviz is once again imperiled…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN56.T;The Sundering of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN56.D;The collapse of the Spanish administration in the east has allowed the Castilian revolutionaries to consolidate their new government. Working with nationalist paramilitaries across the region, they have driven out Spanish bureaucrats and seized control of all the apparatuses and organs of government in the eastern provinces. An eerie feeling of imminent catastrophe has descended upon Spain, with rebel juntas assembling their forces for the struggle to come. The Moors must surely be cackling in their graves : just like the Cordoban caliphate which our ancient ancestors warred against, we too find ourselves shattered and divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN57.T;The Battle for Central Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN57.D;The first skirmishes with the Eastern traitors have already begun. Across Estremadura and the province of Salamanca, small but fierce battles have raged between Lisbon loyalists and the rebels seeking to engulf them into their insurrections. The lack of strong centralization in the region has played to our advantage as the common Estremaduran and Salamancan people have rejected the traitors’ pretense of “legitimate” grievances. We have forced them back out of central Spain and kept the area in loyal hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN58.D;The first skirmishes with the Eastern traitors have already begun. Across Estremadura and the province of Salamanca, small but fierce battles have raged between Lisbon loyalists and rebels seeking to engulf them into their insurrections. Our efforts to impose strong centralization in the region has played to our enemies’ advantage - the common Estremaduran and Salamancan people have found sympathy with the traitors’ pretense of “legitimate” grievances. We have been forced out of central Spain and the area is now in enemy hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN58.A;Only a minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.T;Consolidating Castile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.D;Now that we have seized our independence from the cruel Spaniards, we must organize our new nation. An emergency government has been formed to carry us through this time of crisis until we can establish peace. However, while we began as a republic, debate is raging between three internal factions about whether we should adopt a different form of government. The first comprise Castilian republicans who see the institution of monarchy as irreversibly corrupted by the decadent Lorena-Avizes and want a new, democratic order, sympathetic to the councils in the south. The second are Castilian traditionalists who demand a monarchy of our own, aiming to crown prominent Leonese-Castilian nobleman (and close friend of Guerrero) Buenaventura de Franco as King Buenaventura I. The third are Guerrero’s own loyalists who seek to enshrine the charismatic general as “caudillo” of Castile, sympathetic to the conservatives in the north. It soon becomes clear that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.A;The republicans have successfully defended democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.B;Castile shall have a king of her own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN590.T;A Coalition with Seville?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN590.D;With the republicans having fended off the challengers to our nascent democracy, it has been proposed to form a united front with the Junta of Seville. By far the most fanatically anti-monarchist clique in Iberia, we may be able to appeal to our shared values to induce them to join forces against Lisbon and Biscay. If we prevail in the struggle to come, such an alliance between the reformists of Andalusia and ourselves could serve as the foundation for a new, more vibrant and just nation. However if we receive no answer from them then we will be forced to fight them as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN590.A;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN590.B;We are no friend of crazed fanatics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.T;A Coalition with Biscay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.D;With the consolidation of Caudillo Guerrero’s government, it has been proposed to form a united front with the Junta of Biscay. Given that they are stridently opposed to the threats of liberalism and socialism, we may be able to appeal to our shared values to induce them to join forces against Lisbon and Seville. If we prevail in the struggle to come, such an alliance between the traditionalists of the north and ourselves could serve as the foundation for a stronger, bolder nation. However if we receive no answer from them then we will be forced to fight them as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.A;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.B;We are no friend of delusional brutes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.T;A Coalition with Toledo?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.D;Castilian republicans have, unexpectedly, fended off the aspirations of monarchists and dictators to preserve their new democracy. Now they have extended an offer to form a united front against both the Spanish nationalists in Lisbon and the reactionaries in Biscay. While it would compromise the purity of our revolutionary vision, it would certainly increase our chances of survival, and give our people a considerable voice in the national future when our struggle is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.A;Yes, solidarity first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.B;No, we will never serve another master again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.T;A Coalition with Toledo?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.D;Castilian patriots have foiled republican schemes to usurp their movement and have preserved the true spirit of their nation. Now they have extended an offer to form a united front against both the Spanish nationalists in Lisbon and the radicals in Seville. While it would require us to alter and moderate our perspective, it would certainly increase our chances of survival, and give our people a considerable voice in the national future when our struggle is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.A;Yes, we shall be the axis upon which Iberia turns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.B;No, they are just as decadent as the Portuguese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.T;An Alliance with Seville?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.D;The Eastern traitors have formed a Faustian pact with the Junta of Biscay and its crazed leader, Ruben Guerrero, feeding his delusions of “Cantabrianism” in a naked grab for power. Given the manner in which this has strengthened the rebel position, we may want to consider forming a coalition of our own with the Junta of Seville. Unlike Toledo or Biscay, they are not opposed to Spanish reunification, merely the political and economic conditions within Spain. Nevertheless, they do have rather radical views and we would be forced to assimilate some of this radicalism into our own ideology if we want to keep them loyal, but such a compromise could lay the foundation for a better Spain after our struggle is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.A;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.B;No, the Southerners are traitors too and they shall die like traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.T;A Coalition with Lisbon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.D;The esoteric reactionaries of Biscay have joined forces with the Castilians, threatening to overwhelm both Lisbon and ourselves. Now the Spanish government has requested to form a united front with our own movement! They have offered considerable political concessions, including full parliamentary democracy and land reform, if we agree to merge our forces back into their own. While many of our comrades are insistent that we cannot compromise our democratic vision, in the face of a stronger reactionary position in the north, we may not have any other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.A;Yes, we cannot afford to bicker while the right consolidates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.B;No, we are FINISHED with bowing to the Spain of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.T;The Overture;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.D;Spain is passing into darkness. The battle lines have been drawn, and the formerly united Spanish Land Army has broken up along cultural and political lines. Now the juntas are preparing to strike against the Spanish government as well as their own rivals, just as we are preparing to restore order to the nation. Soon enough, the sword of national disunion will be drawn, and rivers of blood shall run through Iberia. But not yet – now, only small skirmishes have broken out in the most contested border regions. For now, we remain in a state of agonizing twilight, the last moments of calm before the full fury of the storm bursts over us all. §RIn a matter of weeks, the Sword of Damocles shall fall upon Spain.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.A;God help us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.T;The Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.D;“Here lies half of Spain. It died of the other half.” - Mariano José de Larra\nEver since the end of the succession war between the liberal José II and the reactionary Pedro III in 1815, Spain has been torn between liberalism and conservatism. That old divide has now become a confrontation between the Spanish identity, situated in the old lands of Portugal, and the identities of outlying regions. At stake is not merely the unity of the nation, but questions of ideology, language, and religion. What is Spain, and who governs it? Is it a force of unity, or merely Portuguese oppression? New ideas of nationalism and separatism have entrenched themselves just as the armies of the juntas are now entrenching themselves on the battlefield and preparing for the most horrific chapter in Spanish history. And as the world watches, yet another question arises : is this merely a dark episode in the story of Europe, or a sign of things to come for all nations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.A;Ask not for whom the bell tolls : It tolls for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.T;The War has Begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.D;All-out fighting against the rival juntas as well as the central Spanish government has now commenced. Our rivals seek to subjugate us towards their own ends, but they shall surely fail! We will stand unbowed and fight for the future of our homeland and our people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.A;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN68.T;The War against the Biscay Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN68.D;The boundless arrogance of the Biscay clique under General Guerrero has left us with no other choice but to destroy them for the sake of Castile. We cannot tolerate their wild delusions and brutal desires! The north must be Castilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN68.A;Arriba!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN69.T;The War against the Seville Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN69.D;The mad aspirations of the Seville clique under Raul Pinto have left us with no other choice but to destroy them for the sake of Castile. We cannot tolerate their revolutionary ravings and socialist dogma! The south must be Castilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN69.A;¡Arriba!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN70.T;Escalation against Biscay and Seville;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN70.D;The machinations of the Biscay and Seville cliques have left us with no other choice but to destroy them both for the sake of Castile. We cannot brook any further challenges to our national destiny! Castile must be whole once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN70.A;¡Arriba!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN71.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN71.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which Iberia has never seen before, Spain has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, and the banners of the Castilians and the other juntas lie torn and discarded, we must now somehow become a nation again. Already our nation’s leading politicians are hard at work, drafting the settlement which they believe shall cement the Spain which has emerged from these horrors as one which shall stand the tests of time. We can only pray that they are correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN71.A;The sun rises once more upon Espanha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN72.T;El Estatuto de Autonomía;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN72.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to accommodate the different cultures and regions of our nation. This “Statue of Autonomy” (or “new fueros” in the words of its detractors) has reorganized Spain into a collection of autonomous communities, each with their own legislatures and protections for their cultural and linguistic aspects. The Statue has also delineated the powers of the regional versus the national government, dividing their responsibilities, and finally establishes a national parliament with a ceremonial head of state. It is hoped that the Statue will allow the old system of the fueros to be superseded without trampling the cultural rights which caused so much bloodshed. The various cultures of Spain are grateful that we have not sought a victor’s peace with them, and separatism in the east has been dealt a tremendous blow. For the first time since 1808, Spain has been truly reunited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN72.A;Una España todas las personas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN73.T;As Grandes Reformas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN73.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to restore national stability. While certain cultural and linguistic rights have been conceded to the historical lands of Castile, the central status of Lisbon within the nation has been confirmed. The document has not brought forth any colossal changes in Spanish governance but given that the nation’s wounds will take many years to heal, perhaps we are not in need of colossal change right now. The peoples of the east mourn for their lost nation but have accepted the hope of building a more equitable Spain alongside the westerners. For the first time since 1808, Spain is at peace within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN73.A;Uma Espanha, com liberdade e justiça para todos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN74.T;O Decreto de Unificação;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN74.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to finally unify the nation. Given that the existence of separate codes throughout the country has proven to be the source of endless strife and division, it has been decided to do away with all of them. A standardized curriculum will be imposed upon all Spanish schools, and all government business will be required to be conducted in “Modern Spanish,” the codified, official language of the nation. Symbols of separatism will be forbidden from public display, and the status of Lisbon as the sole source of legal authority within the nation has been enshrined. Asturians, Basques, Castilians, and Galicians have all reacted with anguish at the news, but thankfully the Guarda Nacional will annihilate any surviving fragments of treasonous militias. For the first time since 1808, Spain has a plan to achieve unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN74.A;A Espanha, indivisa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN75.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN75.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, we must now decide how we shall conclude a peace with the westerners. While most newspaper coverage has depicted all of Castile as being aflame with independentist sentiment, the reality is far more complex. Given that the Castilian economy would necessarily suffer if permanently decoupled from the west, many Castilian politicians have proposed that we force the westerners to reunify Spain on our terms. Therefore we have drafted an extremely decentralized constitution that would make Castile and the other regions of Spain practically independent and remake the feudal system in our image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN75.A;Spain will be Castilian at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN76.T;A Castilian Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN76.D;Our defeat in the civil war has left the country devastated, but the Castilians will give us no time to rest. Their representatives have arrived in Lisbon and have presented a new legal framework to reorganize Spain. The document castrates the authority of the national government, reserving vast amounts of power to the “states of the Spanish Confederation.” Each state may decide its own laws on language, religion, and criminal codes. The land rights of local elites and the Catholic Church have been confirmed, and even the national army has been divided along regional lines, with each state in charge of soldiers from its community. All major institutions of the government are to be relocated to the Castilian heartland, and the Castilian language is to be made the new official language of Spain. The unthinkable has occurred : Castile has become the master of Spain, and Portugal the subject, in the reborn neo-feudal order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN76.A;¿Una España?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN77.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN77.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, Castile prepares to take its first steps onto the world stage as a free and independent nation. The brutal centralization espoused by the westerners over the years has radicalized many Castilians and attempts by moderates to propose reintegration under a highly decentralized system have foundered on the tidal wave of Castilian nationalism. In fact, nationalist and separatist sentiments are sweeping across western Iberia, and it seems as though Spain will soon cease to exist. We are not troubled, however – good riddance! May Castile’s future be one of peace, prosperity, unity, and most of all, no more Spaniards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN77.A;¡Ave Maria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN78.T;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN78.D;In a turn of events which all but the true patriots united under Lord Guerrerro doubted, we have defeated the cowardly Spanish government and forced them to our righteous will! Now the time has come to bring an end to the decadent, rotten Spanish nation. There will be no “reforms,” no attempts to save what is so obviously damned. For Spain, there is only the lake of fire. And for the reborn Cantabrian people, there is only the bright and glowing promise of a future of further triumphs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN78.A;May Spain’s death be our regeneration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN79.T;The Dissolution of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN79.D;The end of the Spanish Civil War may have brought peace to western Iberia, but unity has remained elusive. The differences between the western coast and the rest of the country proved irreconcilable. With multiple juntas refusing to reintegrate back into the nation, Spain has lost most of its population at a stroke. Even the most fervent Spanish nationalists were forced to admit that the country could not continue to exist in such conditions. This morning the Spanish legislature convened for the final time in Lisbon and voted the nation of Spain out of existence, replacing it with a country which has not graced the maps of the world in centuries : Portugal. Former Spanish imperial possessions have been lost in the tumult, scooped up by foreign powers. A new day dawns over Iberia, one where the Spanish eagle is nowhere to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN79.A;Spain’s story may be over, but the story of her children is not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN80.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN80.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, we must now decide how we shall conclude a peace with the westerners. While most newspaper coverage has depicted all of Castile as being aflame with independentist sentiment, the reality is far more complex. Given that the Castilian economy would suffer if permanently decoupled from the west, many Castilian politicians have proposed that we force the westerners to reunify Spain on our terms. Therefore we have drafted a new constitution to enshrine parliamentary democracy as the foundation of Spain and establish a federal republic to defend minority rights. The time has come for our people to enter modernity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN80.A;Let us all bask in the light of the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN81.T;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN81.D;To the astonishment of all except the heroes of the people led by Raul Pinto, we have defeated the tyrannical Spanish government and forced it to listen to the will of its citizens! Now the time has come to fulfill the long-deferred dream of Spanish liberalism and create a new, radically free nation. No longer shall the lords of old and the proud cities of the west hold the lash over the common man! No longer shall we be made slaves and paupers upon our own soil! We defy those who said that Spain could only be an iron shackle upon another’s neck. By enshrining parliamentary democracy, freedom of the press, the right to unionize, and the ownership of the land by its people, we will bring to birth a new Spain from the ashes of the old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN81.A;Together, we are strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN82.T;The Federal Republic of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN82.D;Our defeat in the civil war has left us devastated, something recognized even by our foes. Their representatives have arrived in Lisbon and presented a new constitution to reorganize the nation. Full parliamentary democracy is to be implemented at once, along with a host of other social protections including freedom of speech, freedom of public assembly, and the right to unionize. Moreover, Spain itself is to become a federal republic, with each constituent state organizing its own codes along the federal model and with certain powers divided between the national and state legislatures. Any remaining members of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty have been permitted to go into exile on the condition of renouncing their claim to the Spanish throne. The liberal dreams of the old revolutionary societies like the Carmelistas have finally been realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN83.T;The Collapse of the Spanish Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN83.D;Spain, the oldest and most steadfast ally of the Dual Monarchy, has ceased to exist. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. Conservatives throughout the Dual Monarchy are horrified, and a few particularly eccentric reactionaries have been seen in public wearing funereal black to “mourn the death of Hispania.” Nevertheless, as our government realigns itself to accommodate this new reality (and the copious refugees which have sought shelter within our nation), our colonial office has reminded us that it would be irresponsible to allow Spain’s former imperial possessions to collapse into anarchy. Due to our status as preeminent global maritime power, we have assumed Spain’s colonial burdens. Anglois soldiers have marched into formerly Spanish colonies and taken control of them for their own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN83.A;Keep calm and carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN85.T;The End of our Servitude;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN85.D;It appears that Spain, our former overlord, has collapsed. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. In the resulting chaos, its imperial possessions have slipped from its grasp. The old machinery of Spanish oppression has thus disintegrated within our nation, and we are now the masters of our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN85.A;Free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN120.T;The Restoration of New Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN120.D;Following our total victory in the New World, the traitorous Columbian Alliance has been dismantled, its leading figures slated for trial for crimes against the Crown. A massive westward migration of bureaucracy and commerce is occurring as the old colonial system has been recreated and the Viceroyalty of New Spain restored. While this is a triumph for Spain, a country whose fortunes had otherwise been flagging as of late, a question has arisen as to whether we should take the opportunity to introduce some new reforms. Many have argued against this, saying that our victory in the New World has proven the liberals wrong and demonstrated that absolutism is the supreme form of government. Others, however, have asserted that if we do not seize upon this moment of royal popularity to solve some of the underlying structural problems which precipitated all of this in the first place, there is no reason that this crisis could not happen again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN120.A;I am the State, and I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN121.T;The Restoration of New Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN121.D;The total defeat of the Columbian Alliance has allowed Spain to recreate the old Viceroyalty of New Spain. The lands of southern Arcadia once more fly the Lorena-Aviz banner, and the Catholic priests in churches throughout the colony once more give praise to the King of Spain, the Most Holy Monarch. Yet the ideals of Columbia – independence, democracy, and personal liberty – can never truly be extinguished. The return of New Spain to the imperial fold may yet force its mother country to learn the ways of her daughter and respect her. For if she does not…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN121.A;Then the children of Vicente may rise up once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN122.T;New Spain in Peril;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN122.D;Ever since our triumph in the South Arcadian Revolt, we have maintained our hegemony within New Spain by virtue of three things : our cultural grandeur, our economic vitality, and our military might. Now that all three of these no longer hold the respect of the world, our influence within New Spain is dropping to dangerous levels. Every day, the colonial office receives new reports of Revolt-era flags being found in New Spaniards’ possession, or treasonous pamphlets advocating independence being discovered. Small but passionate protests have begun to occur across New Spain, demanding increased autonomy or even independence. §RIf we do not quickly recover the world’s esteem as a great nation then we may lose New Spain once more – permanently.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN122.A;We will not falter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN123.T;Fim do Domínio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN123.D;“Sancho! My armor!” – Last words of Dom Quixote\nSpain may have destroyed the Columbian Alliance in battle, but their ideas have remained, fueled by the unconquerable memories of those who value liberty, democracy, and independence. The decline of Spanish power has created the perfect climate for separatism to once again arise amongst the populace. After weeks of demonstrations against continued Spanish rule, the Viceregal government has collapsed. The elderly Viceroy Velasco de Iturbide attempted to personally lead a cavalry charge against a crowd in Mexico City, only to die of a heart attack in the saddle. This plunged the colony into chaos, and a provisional government led by the popular General Manuel Diaz took power. Diaz wasted no time in declaring independence, cementing Spain’s total failure in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN123.A;And thus ends the tale of the Spanish Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN124.T;A Era Dourada;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN124.D;For centuries, Spain has been wandering in the dark, trying to rediscover its path. Cervantes likened us to a senile nobleman, trapped in a bygone era while the world moved on. Yet just as the sun must rise and drive out the night, so our nation has arisen again to illuminate the world! But this time, we do not do so alone. We do so as a family, united with all our relatives. Cubans, New Granadans, Salvadorans, New Spaniards of both Mexico and Lusitania, and yes, even Castilians – all members of the Spanish dynasty. As the new Hispanic Cortes convenes for the first time, representatives from across Arcadia, Ameriga, and Europe are preparing to collectively shoulder the responsibility of governing our blessed people. The rising of the new day finds us not as a despot lording over their subjects, but as an everlasting and democratic union of kindred cultures, the Hispanic Commonwealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN124.A;A commonwealth upon which the sun shall never again set!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN125.T;The Prodigal Son Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN125.D;The proclamation of the Hispanic Commonwealth has caused a remarkable transformation of the easterners. Now that they have finally been given a truly equal stake in the nation, many of them have abandoned their ferocious nationalism in favor of fighting for Castile’s rights within the Hispanic framework. While Castilian separatists shall unfortunately exist for the foreseeable future, the demands for an independent Castile have rapidly begun to disappear from the east. They have been replaced with a determination to safeguard the rights of their people while still supporting the Commonwealth’s endeavors and renewing their faith in our government. Castile, the prodigal son of Hispania, has returned to the fold at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

callabero_decre_desc;Our rule in Spanish Mauretania continues to suffer due to the lack of native collaborators, forcing us to rely solely upon Spanish colonists and the colonial garrisons. A new measure has been suggested by the Sephardic Minister of Justice, Francisco Callabero, to enshrine the citizenship of all native Jews in our North African possessions. Jews were briefly made citizens of Spain during the Josephine era before the War of the Spanish Succession, after all, and the Jewish population on the mainland remains small. Hopefully this shall both strengthen our grip on Mauretania and accelerate the assimilation of the Mauretanian Jews.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This document will reorganize the nation along federal lines, to provide for equality without obstructing legal and administrative matters. The most important component of this new constitution will be the “Estatuo del Autonomia,” the Statue of Autonomy, which will officially classify each major region of Spain as an autonomous community. Each community will possess its own legislature, and various powers such as setting state language laws and infrastructure funding will be reserved to them. With this document, we will formally divide the powers of governance between the national and regional governments, and the issues driving separatism shall at last be laid to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Certain provisions will be put in place to allow Castilian linguistic and cultural traditions to continue, but any outdated or conflicting laws will be made to conform with the national standard. With this document, we will bring Spain into the modern era, and the feudal legacy enabling separatism shall at last be laid to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

gaming_spain_conclusion_desc;“The righteous Spanish cause is the destruction of the separatists. You know who they are and where to find them.” - Typical “liquidation” notice distributed to Spanish militias\nWe have formulated a two-tiered plan to unify Spain. The first will be done in public : the promulgation of a truly unitarian constitution, one to centralize all power in Lisbon, along with a national curriculum and the codification of the “Modern Spanish” language. These measures will destroy the legal and cultural measures which the separatists hide behind. The second, however, will be done in secret. This is Directive Number One, distributed to sympathetic militias and paramilitary groups across Spain. Prominent separatist politicians, authors, and artists will be targeted for assassination, as will any military officer whose loyalties are suspect. By using groups not officially connected to the government for these operations, we will reduce the chance of detection. With these two documents, we will annihilate all traitors throughout Spain, and the criminals seeking to tear our nation apart shall at least receive their eternal reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

form_iberia_desc;Now that we have found a way to balance the needs of the nation with the desires of its constituent cultures and regions, a sense of unity is spreading throughout our society the likes of which has never been seen before. Our success at unifying these diverse cultures has caused some political thinkers to propose that we seek to expand our goals to unify the entire Iberian Peninsula. To do this – to unite with the Catalans, Valencians, and Aragonese, and form the first truly unified Christian state in the region since the ancient Visigoths – would require us to exert tremendous influence over the eastern Iberian coast. But if the Catalans are weak enough, and if they have been forced to give up their Italian ambitions, then we might be able to bind east to west and realize the goals of pan-Iberianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Through cunning political maneuvering, they have managed to play all three powers against one another and prevent the complete loss of their independence. However, our influence in the region is now so overwhelming that we may seriously consider attempting to merge Navarre into our own nation. Our legal scholars, by now well experienced in handling the demands of certain cultures, assure us that it would be a simple matter to design an internal autonomy arrangement to satisfy the Navarrese. Viva Navarra e Espanha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But we, the loyal sons and daughters of the west, have never given up hope that Spain might one day be redeemed. And now, that day has come! From the western shores to the eastern highlands, all the old Spanish lands are once more within our grasp. This time we shall not seek to crush our brothers and sisters beneath our heels, but instead seek a reasoned understanding with them. Spain will be reforged along federal lines, with each cultural region accorded their autonomies while remaining loyal to the national government. The Castilians boast of being eagles, soaring into the sky, but our ascent, our resurrection, shall be even greater! Like Lazarus, Spain emerges from her tomb, restored to health and splendor!

There is a growing sentiment within Spain that the government must take a more active role in promoting social welfare, particularly that of children. This sentiment has now crystallized behind the movement to pass what is commonly referred to as the New Systems Bill. This measure would do two things : establish a free public school system with mandatory enrollment, and forbid the employment of any person below a certain age. It is hoped that this will reduce child mortality and grow our learned, literate populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Cuban nationalism has still been rising, but there is time to prevent it from becoming uncontrollable. Advances in communication technology make it possible to create the first overseas legislature in Cuba, giving the Cubans local autonomy within the Spanish Empire without surrendering the influence of the metropole in their affairs.

While we have had some success cultivating a population of loyalists in the east, western New Granada has been a hotbed of unrest, being a vast and mountainous territory at the edge of the wild Amazon rainforest. The escapades of notorious warlords Guillermo de Blanco and Antonio Rocafuerte are proof that New Granada urgently requires attention to preserve law and order. Thus, we will create a New Granadan legislature, and introduce economic reforms to increase New Granadan trade as a condition of their integration. Combined with laws to safeguard their cultural traditions, we should be able to affirm New Granada’s status as a loyal part of the Spanish Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Advances in communication and transportation technology, however, may finally allow us to enmesh San Salvador’s rich lands with the international market. We will create a new Salvadoran legislature and introduce economic reforms to spur development. Combined with laws to safeguard their cultural traditions, we should be able to affirm San Salvador’s status as a loyal part of the Spanish Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA1.T;Of Master and Slave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA1.D;Plantagenia is a kingdom facing uncertain times. Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago, his young son Louis I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running, but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many Plantagenians feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in Plantagenia), the opposition of Queen-Regent Catherine de Valois-Medici to it, and the relations with native peoples are all putting pressure on Plantagenian society and its entrenched Planteur power structure. Furthermore, relations with the Belgian Confederacy, the Columbian Alliance, and the Scandinavian colonies are fraught with tensions over various border disputes. If Plantagenia is to escape the chains of the past and head into the future, someone will have to loosen her bonds…or break them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA1.A;Look away, look away, look away, Cadie land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA2.T;The Great Storm of 1837;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA2.D;Nouvelle-Orleans is optimally situated in terms of commerce, the natural trade hub of the Carribbean and southern Arcadia, with a commanding position on the Mississippi River. Unfortunately, it is also quite vulnerable to hurricanes, the massive tropical storms which occasionally sweep into the Caribbean. Lying on a floodplain at the bottom of a coasetal valley, Nouvelle-Orleans’ surrounding environs are essentially a giant bowl : if the levies on the river fail, nothing stands in the way of its flooding. A few days ago, a giant storm made landfall on the coast. With little time to react, many Nouvelle-Orleaners were caught in the maelstrom of pounding rain and winds strong enough to embed splinters of wood in hardened cement! Our nation’s beautiful capital has been devastated, and it will take months for all the damage to be repaired. To say nothing of the lives lost…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA2.A;The price we pay for living in Nouvelle-Orleans is steep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA3.T;Apaches Raid Saint Sauveur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA3.D;The Apaches are an especially ferocious tribe living on the western plains. Though they are too decentralized to launch organized conquests like the Inca of Ameriga, they still possess the skill and coordination to conduct brutal attacks against the Plantagenian frontier. This morning we received word that another Apache assault had occurred in the town of Saint Sauveur. It came at dusk, just after the sun had set. Apache braves on horseback descended upon the town, picking off lone Plantagenians and brutalizing the settlers who attempted to defend the area. It was only the timely intervention of a local frontier patrol which prevented them from pillaging the whole town, though they still managed to escape. They inflicted severe damage and it will take months for Saint Sauveur to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA3.A;Damned savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA4.T;Saint Sauver Raided Again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA4.D;In an act of astonishing temerity, the Apache savages have attacked Saint Sauveur less than a month after their last incursion! This time, the raid came just before dawn. While most townspeople were still asleep, another horde of Apache braves rode straight into the town. Since the last raid, many townspeople had acquired weapons, and so were better prepared to fight. The result was street-by-street fighting between settlers and Apaches, and the reduced amount of looting was balanced out by the increased bloodshed across the town. The incident has animated westerners against the tribes of the frontier, and now western politicians are now calling on the government to take a stronger stance on the Apache threat and pacify the west. §RYet if we do so we would be moving away men and resources that might otherwise be allocated defending against the Belgians, who seek to reclaim their lost southern lands.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA4.B;No, we must stay on our guard against the Belgians!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA5.T;The Coronation of King Louis I de Orleans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA5.D;Louis I has finally reached his age of majority. In an opulent ceremony filled with pomp and splendor, he was coronated King Louis I of Plantagenia by the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans. Louis may be a young king, but he must learn quickly. With his anti-slavery mother, Queen Catherine, no longer the head of state, various factions are beginning to emerge, seeking to influence him. Those who support or oppose slavery, those who seek war against the natives or against the Belgians, even those who desire an end to the monarchy…There are many who seek Louis as a pawn to be captured, and used against their rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA5.A;But Louis is a king, not a pawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA6.T;A Royal Visit to La Galette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA6.D;King Louis I has recently been touring his new domain, familiarizing himself with the land and its people, while building popular support for the monarchy. His recent stop in the growing town of La Galette, however, seems to have awakened something within the young monarch. While he had visited La Galette for the purpose of officially designating it as a royal city, he has been enraptured by this “Gateway to the West.” He spent quite a bit of time inspecting the outlands of the region, much to the shock of the locals, and even conducted some of his tours while riding on horseback. All in all, the frontier life seems to suit the “boy king” quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA6.A;How gauche!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA7.T;Lord of the Plains;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA7.D;Louis’ time in La Galette has affected him even more profoundly than had first been thought. In the weeks since the end of his national tour, he has made several trips out to the frontier, often upon his own horse! Frontier towns and settlements across the plains have become accustomed to the sight of the king riding into town, his entourage scrambling to follow. Louis particularly enjoyed engaging in buffalo hunts with royal Indian auxiliaries, to the point where his white minders were somewhat embarrassed by the familiar and fraternizing manner with which he treated them. Nouvelle-Orleans and the other cities of culture and refinement back west have been astonished by the king’s plebian activities, but he has befriended quite a few influential politicians and family patriarchs in the region. What’s more, the image of the dashing young “Roi-Vacher,” riding across the plains with the same attire and attitude as the other frontiersmen, is quickly winning the hearts of the people of northwestern Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA7.A;A cowboy king – what is this world coming to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA8.T;The Planteur Aristocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA8.D;Every monarchy has a noble class which must be managed, but the Plantagenian aristocracy wields tremendous power in comparison to the nobility of other nations. Hailing from English and French bloodlines of the highest pedigree, these men and women control enormous plantations employing hundreds of slaves. The conditions upon these fields are said by radical liberals to be utterly brutal, dominated by torture and violence. The Planteurs, however, swear up and down that they are the preservers of chivalry, tending to their slaves with the benevolence of a parent. As codified in the Second Charter of 1814, the censitary vote system weighs the impact of slaveowners according to their slaves even though the slaves themselves cannot vote. This means that the upper house is completely dominated by Planteur interests, and the lower house thoroughly influenced by them as well. Resentment is building against the Planteurs but at the moment their position is difficult to assail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA8.A;A toast to our lords and ladies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA9.T;The Knight of Saint Georges;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA9.D;“It is not enough to say, ‘I am a man.’ I am a man of noble blood, white and black together, noble not despite my African heritage but BECAUSE of it. I feel no shame in being a mulatto because there is none. Is a mulatto not a man and a brother? Shall you weigh the hearts of all yellow men, bestowing rights upon one but not another, because of an insufficient quantity of European blood? If a man of European paternity and noble birth can be denied freedom, then no man in Plantagenia, not even the richest master of enslaved negros, is free.”\n\nSir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges is a scion of a noble family which accompanied the Anglois Charles I to Arcadia. Unlike many mulattos he is technically legitimate as his father married his slave mother in secret. Sent to Europe for his studies, he fought for the liberals in the Hungarian Revolution. The existence of “yellow” (mulatto) nobles has long irritated the Planteurs but Sir Saint-Georges is now spreading ideas of racial equality unheard of in Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA9.A;All men were “created equal?” Sounds dangerous to me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA10.T;The Loi Jaune and its Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA10.D;Despite the best efforts of the Planteurs, the frequency of racial intermixture between whites and blacks has given rise to a class of “yellow” or mulatto peoples within Plantagenia. Their existence has proved vexing to the traditional racial dichotomy of European whites above and blacks and natives below. To maintain the Planteur power structure, the Loi Jaune, or “Yellow Law” has been on the books in Plantagenia for decades. The law sharply curtails the civil liberties of free mixed-race people, despite a notable amount of them physically appearing to be just as white as any Planteur. Many mulattos are now agitating for the repeal of the Loi Jaune, especially due to the influence of the Knight of Saint Georges, who has made the repeal of the law his first political priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA10.A;Could Plantagenia even survive a future without such protections?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA11.T;The Skræling Jesuits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA11.D;For centuries, the Sacred Order of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, or simply the Jesuits, has been carrying out missionary work among the tribes of the Great Lakes. Unlike many missionaries, the Jesuits immerse themselves in native cultures. They learn and speak their languages, adopt their ways, and live amongst them, to gain their trust and evangelize in ways that natives can understand. Many tribes have not been receptive, but the Jesuits have seen great success working with the southern Algonquins of the Southwestern Confederacy. They have converted many Indians to the Catholic faith, even if the Indians don’t always uphold the proper rites. Now, however, as tensions rise across Scandinavian Arcadia, some believe that the Skræling Confederacy may collapse. If that happens then the Jesuit networks could enable us to attempt to take control of the Southwestern Confederacy. §RDoing this, however, would divert resources being used to prepare for a potential war with the Belgians.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA11.A;We will not abandon our fellow Catholics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA11.B;They can handle themselves, we must guard against the Belgians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA12.T;Rebirth of the Fils de la Liberté;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA12.D;Decades ago, the Belgian Revolution saw the Belgian Confederacy break free from Plantagenian rule. Louisiane, the Atlantic coast of Plantagenia, joined them in their revolt, fomented by a revolutionary group known as the Fils de la Liberté or “Sons of Liberty.” In the years since our recovery of the region, Louisiane nationalism had receded, but never truly died. Now it seems to be resurgent. We have discovered that a second Fils de la Liberté organization has been formed, with some members believed to be the sons or grandsons of the original conspirators. Animated by the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars, the Fils are republicans who demand an end to the monarchy, to the concentration of power in the hands of the Nouvelle-France elite of central Plantagenia, and to the “Plantagenian occupation” of Louisiane. Drawing support from the small landowners in Louisiane, the group’s fusion of Louisianais nationalism and militant republicanism could jeopardize our stability and territorial integrity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA12.A;Damned rabble-rousers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA13.T;The King’s View;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA13.D;The rise of the Fils de la Liberté has caused King Louis I to question his role as monarch. Up until now, the Second Charter of 1814 has limited the Plantagenian king’s ability to directly influence politics. Drafted by those who endured the mad ambitions of Charles II’s bid to become Emperor of Arcadia, the Charter was intended as a compromise with the more liberal east coast. It confirms the king’s status as head of state but still remands significant powers to the legislature, along with codifying the individual rights to life and property of the average Plantagenian citizen. Yet, the King wonders, must these “rights to property” include slavery? Is that not a perversion of justice? Could opposing slavery break the stranglehold of Nouvelle-France? Though the Planteurs will abhor it, many monarchists believe that the time has come for the King to take a more active role in politics, and Louis is starting to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA13.A;It is time for Louis to stand up and make his voice heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA13.B;The charter must and shall guide the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA14.T;The Rosalie Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA14.D;“The maintenance of constant vigilance against the enemies of Our nation is Our firm commitment. We endeavor to defend Plantagenia with all Our power and know that Our subjects do the same. Yet as We consider the threats to Plantagenia, We see one rise above the rest, one internal rather than external. We believe that the Peculiar Institution degrades both the social and the productive power of our nation : it makes us serfs of moral prejudice. Rather than providing a sound foundation for the realm, it is a foundation of sand. It may beguile from a distance, but apply force to it, and it dissipates, and woe to the house which rests upon it. Shall we build our houses upon sand when our neighbors build their fortresses upon iron?” – King Louis I\n\nThe King has recently made a shocking speech in Rosalie, in which he has suggested that slavery is both immoral and placing our financial and national security in jeopardy! The Planteurs are outraged, but the liberals and mulattoes have been energized..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA14.A;Slavery, a moral and national peril? An interesting notion…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA15.T;”Sic Semper Tyrannis”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA15.D;Louis’ recent denouncement of slavery has drawn severe criticism from the Planteur aristocracy. A recent pamphlet circulating in Nouvelle-Orleans and other nearby cities, “Sic Semper Tyrannis : On the Matter of Despotism and Liberty,” typifies this reaction. It is a scathing denouncement of the ways in which King Louis I is supposedly grasping for power, declaring him to be “the MAD DESPOT Charles the Second come once again upon the world to clench the nation in his mailed fist and CRUSH with all his Strength the vitality from its people!” The work equates Louis’ criticisms of slavery with a desire to destroy the Charter, eliminate civil liberties, and become an unchallenged autocrat. The pamphlet ends on an ominous note : “If we cannot find protection from the Crowned Heads which WE THE PEOPLE have charged to defend our lives and our property, then it may be necessary to WATER THE TREE OF LIBERTY WITH THE BLOOD OF TYRANTS.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA15.A;Ridiculous drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA16.T;Louis’ Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA16.D;Tensions regarding abolitionism and republicanism are reaching a fever pitch within Plantagenia. If the government does not address either movement, it may find itself overthrown. Louis and his council have held several meetings to address the situation and two solutions have arisen, both involving the use of the royal prerogative. The first would be the most direct : abolish slavery by royal decree. This would win Louis the loyalty of colored Plantagenians, including influential mulattos like Saint-Georges. It would also infuriate the Planteurs to the point that they could likely pass a law to abolish the monarchy on the grounds of what they would likely frame as Louis’ “gross overreach of power.” The other, less extreme option would be to issue a new royal charter to expand civil liberties, undermining the Planteurs’ power without challenging them head on. This would improve Louis’ opinion with the white middle class, the Louisianais especially, but would mean letting slavery go unchallenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA16.A;The time has come to end this vile enterprise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA16.B;We must work with the Louisianais for the sake of national unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA17.T;La Loi D'or;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA17.D;“Article 1 : From the date of this law, slavery is declared extinct in Plantagenia. Article 2 : All dispositions to the contrary are revoked.”\n\nKing Louis I has signed into law the shortest and most significant bill in Plantagenian history. Drafted by his Minister of Justice, Jean de Beauregard, the “Declaration on the Extinction of Slavery in Plantagenia,” or simply the “Golden Law,” has immediately and unconditionally ended slavery in Plantagenia. Its proclamation has broken like a thunderstorm upon the country. Liberals are ecstatic, as are the men of color, but the Planteurs are beside themselves with fury. Many Planteurs are enraged at the notion of abolition, while others are shocked that the King has not even offered them financial compensation for their slaves. Rumors abound as to how they will react, but republicanism seems to be sweeping the upper classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA17.A;A nation redeemed…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA18.T;The End of the Plantagenian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA18.D;“Fellow citizens : The people and the armed forces, in perfect harmony of sentiment with our fellow-citizens, have just decreed the dethronement of the Royal dynasty, and consequently the extinction of the representative monarchical system of government. As an immediate result of this national revolution, of a character wholly patriotic, a provisional government has just been instituted, whose principal mission is to guarantee its citizens’ rights to liberty and property. Elections shall be held with all deliberate speed to compose the new Republican government.” – Proclamation of the Republic\n\nAfter Louis’s decree, the Planteurs finally gained the strength to undo him. In an emergency session of the legislature, two laws were passed : one annulling the Golden Law, and another abolishing the Plantagenian monarchy and establishing a republic. Planteur Marechal Pierre de Maurras has been sworn in as the republic’s new president, but it seems that the royal family has already fled…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA18.A;What has become of them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA19.T;Louis, the Cowboy King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA19.D;“Four score years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, one which has been long wandering in the wilderness. Now the time has come to bear the torch of liberty and the sword of justice into a land long darkened by the shadows of tyranny, that it might be brightened by our coming. Let all who stand with us have one determination : that our free destiny shall be made manifest by our striving—that our nation, under God, shall at last be liberated—and that government of all people, by all people, for all people, shall not perish from the earth!” – Declaration of La Galette\n\nLouis I was not about to take the Planteurs’ seizure of power lying down. He has withdrawn west to the frontier, where the “Roi-Vacher” is beloved, and declared the Kingdom of Oumessourita! Already he is rallying the frontier to his banner to destroy the “oligarchic insurrection.” Many soldiers are defecting to them, heading west to join the Lord of the Plains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The small landowners of Louisiane, disowning Louis but also dreading the entrenchment of an “unchecked slavocracy” or some such nonsense, have rallied under the leadership of a charismatic lowborn general named George Lafitte. Many soldiers are defecting to their odious liberal insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA21.T;A House Divided;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA21.D;“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I do not believe that this realm can permanently endure, half slave and half free. I do not believe that the house shall fall – I do not believe that the realm shall be dissolved – but I do believe that it shall cease to be divided. It must become all one thing, or all the other. Either the spirit of freedom shall anoint our body politic, or we shall all, regardless of color, be bound by the shackles of slavery.” – King Louis I\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, at reconciling the issues of abolitionism, regionalism, and democracy, have failed. This morning President Pierre de Maurras officially declared an insurrection to exist in the east and the west of Plantagenia, with the representatives from both Oumessourita and Louisiane having already withdrawn to their respective homelands. Nouvelle-France remains loyal, and the northern Indian lands have been placed under martial law, but a prairie wind and a coastal gale both blow hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Either the spirit of freedom shall anoint our body politic, or we shall all, regardless of color, be bound by the shackles of slavery.” – King Louis I\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, at bringing a peaceful end to Plantagenia’s political conflicts, have failed. This morning the insurrectionary Planteur clique officially declared King Louis I an outlaw and demanded his arrest for treason. Word has reached us that the small landowners of Louisiane have also risen in the east, denouncing both the King and the Planteurs. The plains remain loyal but an eastern wind blows hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA22.A;Let us fight to make men free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA23.T;Victory of the Loyalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA23.D;At last, the Planteurs and the Louisianais rebels have been vanquished! Louis I has returned to Nouvelle-Orleans in triumph, its treasonous tricolor banners now nowhere to be seen. The traitorous “Annulment Act” which sought to uphold slavery and destroy the monarchy has been declared illegal, the Kingdom restored, and abolition confirmed. In fact, one of the first tasks of the restored legislature has been to pass the “Law of Equality,” transforming Plantagenia even further. This new law enshrines equal protection under the law for Afro-Frankish people within Plantagenia, ensuring that Plantagenians of color will be properly defended by the government. Plantagenia has awoken from the nightmare of slavery and civil war into a new and more perfect nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA23.A;E pluribus unum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA24.T;The Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA24.D;Tensions amongst white Plantagenians, particularly between the upper classes of Nouvelle-France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders, are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion, monarchists have met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of Plantagenians. The new “Reform Act” is a sweeping expansion of Plantagenian voting and public assembly rights, including the end of censitary suffrage, critically weakening the Planteurs’ grip on political power. Projections for the next elections show significant losses for the Planteurs in places where they were traditionally able to exclude poorer whites from voting. Plantagenia may still be a land of master and slave, but the dawn of bourgeois civil society and middle class-driven politics appears to have come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA25.T;“Le Sens Commun”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA25.D;The enemies of the king in Louisanie appear to be growing bolder. A pamphlet is now circulating in the region which combines the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars with Louisianais nationalism. “Le Sens Commun,” or “Common Sense,” written by an anonymous author, the pamphlet is a denouncement of monarchism. It condemns many aspects of the Plantagenian government, such as hereditary rule of the king and the Planteurs, the legislature’s subordination to the aristocracy, and the general lack of accountability to the people. The pamphlet also points out passages in the Bible which can be construed to be arguments against monarchism. The work finished by taking stock of Louisiane’s resources and highlighting the ways in which they could be used in a revolutionary war against the Crown! “Le Sens Commun” is rapidly gaining readers across the east coast, a trend that will continue unless we address its criticisms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA26.D;When the soldiers who arrived at the royal palace were unable to locate the royal family, many feared they had withdrawn to the frontier to launch an insurrection. It is now clear that these fears were unfounded. The frontier was not nearly so pro-monarchist as had been believed, and it seems that even King Louis I recognized this. A letter has been found from Louis in which he explains that he has gone into exile along with his family, rather than cause further strife “in a nation which is so thoroughly animated against the principles of government which I represent.” While the Planteurs are jubilant, dark rumors are swirling that forces in both the eastern and western fringes of the nation may be conspiring against the new regime. If this is true then we must stand ready to defend our rights to life, liberty, and property!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA26.A;Vive la république!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA27.T;The Declaration of La Galette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA27.D;“When, in consequence of oligarchy and dictatorship on the part of the government, tyranny prevails, and civil society is made to dissolve, in such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable right of the people, enjoins them as a right and a sacred obligation to their posterity, to abolish such government, and create another in its stead. We therefore…do hereby resolve and declare, that our political connection with the Acadien nation has forever ended, and that the people of Oumessourita do constitute a free, sovereign, and independent republic.” – Declaration of Oumessouritan Independence\n\nThe Oumessouritans of the frontier have always disdained the aristocracy of Nouvelle-France, but they were outraged when they heard that the Planteurs had driven the Orleanses from the nation to uphold slavery. Deeming Acadianie irreversibly compromised, they have declared independence and are preparing to defend themselves by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA28.T;Saint-Georges’ Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA28.D;While we have been preparing to deal with the Oumessouritans, it appears that other intrigues are afoot. Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges gathered a group of both black and white men and led an attack on the national arsenal at Tasralousa! According to several raiders captured during the incident, he had originally planned to take and hold the arsenal as a base of operations to incite slave revolts in the area but changed his plans after learning more about the facility and the local garrison. A few days ago, around two dozen rebels descended upon the armory, cut the telegraph lines, and detained a train which attempted to pass through the area. Word was spread among slaves in the region, who fled their bondage and rallied to join Saint-Georges. The influx of manpower allowed him to make his escape just as the Tasralousan militia arrived. The rogue knight now has hundreds of men and thousands of guns at his disposal, and Planteurs across the nation are horrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA28.A;Damn that madman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA29.T;The Plains Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA29.D;Interrogation of men captured from Saint-Georges’ raid has revealed that this attack was merely the first part of a plan to ignite a general insurrection of slaves across eastern Acadienie. If this is true, then we may soon find ourselves in a struggle for our way of life against the savage hordes of the bondsmen. Some are now suggesting that we should allow Oumessourita to go unmolested while we steel ourselves for the battle to come. Recognizing their independence would be a severe blow to Acadien national sovereignty, but the notion of fighting a two-front war with the vachers of the west and the slaves of the east is not a pleasant one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA29.A;If we must give up the plains to prevent destruction, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA29.B;Secession is illegal – period!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA30.T;We are Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA30.D;It seems that the Planteurs were even more cowardly than we had expected. Rather than challenge our independence, they have recognized us as the newest nation in Arcadia. Rumors allege this is due to the looming threat of a slave revolt in eastern Acadianie, but whatever the cause, Oumessourita may now forge its own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA30.A;Yeehaw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA31.T;The Plains War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA31.D;As expected, the Planteurs did not accept our newfound freedom. They have declared Oumessourita to be “the location of an existing insurrection” and have mustered their forces to attempt to subjugate us once more. They will fail! Across our new nation, men and women long hardened by life on the frontier are making ready to defend themselves against the decadent greed of Nouvelle-France. We shall be free men, as our fathers were, and sooner welcome death than live as the Planteurs’ slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA31.A;Rally ‘round the snake flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA32.T;Failure of the Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA32.D;Tensions amongst white Plantagenians, particularly between the upper classes of New France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders, are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion, monarchists had met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of white Plantagenians. Proposals included a massive expansion of voting rights for white men of all classes and the protection of the right to freedom of assembly. The loss of censitary suffrage, however, proved to be too radical for the legislature to stomach, and the bill was unceremoniously killed on the upper house floor. The Louisianais, and lower- and middle-class whites nationwide, are outraged at the Planteurs’ blatant quashing of democracy. Peaceful measures to curtail the Planteurs’ power seem doomed by their stranglehold on the legislature, and now even white citizens are calling for more forceful action to obtain their rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA32.A;Damned plebeians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA33.T;The Liberty Battalions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA33.D;Rising national tension has caused an increased recruitment among local militias, but Sir Saint-Georges’ latest creation is another beast entirely. The baron has been gathering free men of color into what he calls his “Liberty Battalions,” non-governmental militias recruited from Saint-George’s home state of Alibamon. While he claims that they are merely devoted to protecting colored freemen against racist attacks, nearly all Planteurs are convinced otherwise. Rumors abound that they are spreading propaganda against the government and the Planteurs, and that these Battalions will form the core of an insurrectionary colored army. Recently, Alibamon Governor Armand Leclerc signed off on a warrant to arrest the baron for treason due to the militia’s formation, but he and many militia members seem to have gone underground. A manhunt is ongoing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA33.A;This is criminal activity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA34.T;Assault on Fort Tolouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA34.D;The traitorous Liberty Battalions have finally attacked! The blow fell upon Fort Toulouse, a coastal Alibamon bastion near the city of the same name. Early in the morning, a column of colored militia headed towards the front gates, carrying an unfamiliar flag. When asked to identify themselves and state their business, they declared that they were the “First Infantry Regiment of the Libérien Republic,” and demanded the surrender of the fort! The commander refused, causing the militia to lay siege. Unfortunately, the fort was intended to defend against coastal rather than land attacks, and the garrison was small due to no expected action. The Battalions were able to blast open a side entrance, whereupon their forces poured in, grabbed all the munitions they could carry, and departed. Fighting a rearguard action against the Alibamon militia as they left, they seem to have split up and dispersed somewhere west of Talahasi. Saint-Georges now has considerable amounts of weaponry and ammunition at his disposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA34.A;The spark to light the eastern powderkeg…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA35.T;Maroon Bands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA35.D;A terrifying rumor has whipped through Planteur society. It concerns the marroons, communities of slave descendants who fled their plantations and have made their own fortified towns in the wilderness near the mountains. The Liberty Battalions under the rogue mulatto Sir Saint-Georges are believed to have dispersed across the northeast, distributing weaponry to the maroons and recruiting them into their ranks. Armed groups of marroons have now been spotted venturing out of the forests, launching raids on plantations to rescue what slaves they can before melting back into the wilderness to escape retaliation. With attacks growing more frequent, the entirety of the east may soon plunge into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA35.A;This is a catastrophe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA36.T;The Libérien Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA36.D;For hundreds of years, the descendants of African slaves have endured toil and torture for their French masters across southeastern Arcadia. Though aspiring to freedom, only the lucky few could save themselves. Now, however, the moral arc of the universe appears to be curving towards the children of Africa, to their elevation and their old masters’ ruination. The efforts of radical mulattos like Sir Saint-Georges to arm slaves and marroons against the central government, combined with raids by enterprising abolitionists, has transformed into something never seen. What has occurred in the east, as the entire apparatus of the national government recoils westward, is not a slave revolt, not even a rebellion, but a revolution which has established an insurrectionary nation. Built and governed by Afro-Franks, for Afro-Franks, its advent has shaken white society worldwide. The Planteurs call it Hell and the Europeans call it anarchy but its new citizens call her by the name of their dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA37.T;Yellow Aristocrats Defect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA37.D;The consolidation of our revolution has given hope to men and women of color across the former slave labor camps which the vile “Planteur” enslavers dared to call “plantations.” While we have done our utmost to liberate the people, however, we have also been approached by those already free. Not just any ordinary free people of color, but the “jaune hommes,” the mulatto aristocrats who have begun to rise to prominence over the last few years. Having chafed for decades under oppressive and hypocritical “lois jaune,” they now seek to make a clean break with the Planteurs and join our revolution. The more suspicious revolutionaries are wary of embracing them, given their upper-class background – a half-black man is half-white, after all – but their wealth, education, and military experience would all be valuable assets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA37.A;Any man of color is our ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA37.B;Watch these “gentlemen” closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA38.T;The Chain of Command;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA38.D;As we prepare to march to war for the liberation of our people, questions have arisen regarding the composition of the new Libérien officer corps. Given the significant role of mulatto support in securing Libérie, our leader among them, many of them had expected to be placed in commanding roles. While it is unquestionable that they have more military experience than freed slaves, adopting such an overt preferential policy will rankle the sentiments of black men and has troubling implications given the egalitarian spirit in Libérien society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA38.A;Sir Saint-Georges leads and the mulattoes shall follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA38.B;Let all heirs of Africa rise through the ranks according to their merit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA39.T;Criticism of the Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA39.D;Sir Saint-Georges and his colleagues are not perfect, despite their supporters’ pretensions. This is a known fact in the abstract, but its consequences are causing political division amongst Libériens. His attempt to balance aristocratic tendencies with republican zeal, and his forceful, determined manner, has brought criticism. The actual complaints vary – that he and his leading men are hypocrites, autocrats, or too focused on war to attend to the needs of freedmen – but the critiques of our leader are escalating and growing more complex. There is a fear that allowing such sentiments to remain in the public sphere will sabotage the revolution and embolden its internal enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA39.A;We will not tolerate libel or slander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA39.B;Unfortunately, free men have the right to speak their minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.T;Caporalisme Agraire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.D;While the liberation of the plantations has furnished our army with a great number of new recruits, it has proved catastrophic for our infant economy. With Afro-Franks abandoning the fields in droves to take up arms against their old masters, there simply are not enough people willing to perform the labor necessary to keep our agricultural economy running, and we are facing an imminent financial crisis. A solution has now been proposed by certain…strong-willed commanders, based on small-scale operations which have already been successfully implemented in the field. Referred to as caporalisme agraire, or “agrarian militarism,” it involves detailing certain freemen with agricultural duty – often on the same plantations they once labored at - overseen by the Libérien military. Although the system would certain stabilize the economy, liberal revolutionaries decry the proposal as “slavery by another name and in a black guise.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.A;We need a solvent treasury, means be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.B;The sins of the past shall find no resurrection here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA41.T;The Libérien War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA41.D;Order has now completely broken down in the east. The slaves have joined forces with free people of color to create a revolutionary black state and threaten to destroy our society! There can be no negotiation, no compromise, no reasoning with these savage criminals! Either we shall annihilate them, or we will be annihilated – there are no other options. We shall enact a brutal revenge upon all of the fiends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA41.A;Death to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA42.T;Growing Tensions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA42.D;The revolutionary war against the Planteurs has been hard upon our people. All Libériens have made sacrifices in the name of victory, but that victory continues to elude us, and many are starting to ask dark questions about our future. Some believe that Saint-Georges was never qualified to lead us in the first place, that he is a vain glory-hound who has lost his touch for commanding armies. Others believe that the whites within our nation have sabotaged us, that they are aiding the enemy and even attacking our own troops to further the cause of slavery and white supremacy. Communities across Libérie are now expelling their white members…or removing them permanently. If we don’t turn our battlefield fortunes around then this state of agitation will only worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA42.A;Do not lose hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA43.T;Swamp Freemen join Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA43.D;The southern swamplands of the Athesian Peninsula, and the native tribes which dwell there, have for centuries vexed all attempts to conquer or subdue them. Neither the Dual Monarchy, nor Venice, nor Plantagenia could successfully colonize this wild and forbidding region and its hardy Indians. Instead, it has become a refuge for escaping slaves, whose marroon towns have come to make up a sizable amount of the Athesian population. With word of our revolution spreading, these men and women have now emerged to aid our righteous cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA43.A;Welcome home, brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA44.T;Nouvelle-Orleans Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA44.D;After ferocious fighting, both around and within the city, our forces have at last taken control of Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean. Unfortunately, most of the enemy government evacuated before we arrived, but its capture still marks a critical turning point in the war. The most immediate question is how we should advise the city garrison to conduct themselves. It is tempting to take this opportunity to enact vengeance upon the city and people who have for centuries been the beating, corrupted heart of Arcadian slavery, the origin point of our and our families’ generations of savage torture, labor, and misery. However, Nouvelle-Orleans is a famous city, especially in the Dual Monarchy. Vandalization of the city could make us the enemy of white regimes everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA45.D;Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean, has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Our defenders fought with noble resolve, but in the end, we were forced to withdraw after evacuating as many people as possible. Whites across the nation are anguished at the news of the city’s loss to the eastern hordes, and the suspect elements of our people have been emboldened to further resistance and aid of the rebellious slaves. The news that they seem to have acted with general restraint in their occupation is of little comfort, and many simply do not believe it is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA45.A;A shadow falls over us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA46.T;The Sacking of Nouvelle-Orleans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA46.D; Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean, has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Our defenders fought with noble resolve, but in the end, we were forced to withdraw after evacuating as many people as possible. The brutes acted with wild abandon, dragging respectable citizens through the streets, looting every building they found, and setting fire to the royal palace and national legislature. Much of the city now lies in ruins. Refugees are pouring in, repeating hellish stories of barbaric atrocities perpetrated by the savage enemy. The only comfort we have in this evil time is that support of our cause abroad is now growing. Nouvelle-Orleans’ ravaging is front-page news from Lisbon to Warsaw, and the Dual Monarchy in particular is outraged by what many Anglois see as the ravishing of their political child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA46.A;$THISCOUNTRY$ faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA47.T;The Rape of a Virgin City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA47.D;For many Anglois, Nouvelle-Orleans, the capital of Plantagenia, has shone as a beacon of culture in the New World, seat of the aristocracy and the closest cultural kin to the grand cities of the Dual Monarchy. This has made recent events even more horrifying. Word has reached Europe that a massive slave revolt in eastern Plantagenia has coalesced into a revolution carried out under the banner of the “Libérien Republic.” It seems that the war against said rogues has now gone so badly for the Plantagenians that they had to abandon Nouvelle-Orleans. Upon taking over the city, the rebels laid waste to it. If even half of the stories of their actions in the city are true, then the Pearl of the Caribbean – the daughter of Paris – has been scourged and harrowed in ways which civilization cannot permit. Anglois patriots across the nation are filled with righteous fury towards these savages, and a bill to invade and put down the slave revolt is ready for passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA48.T;The Avengers of the New World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA48.D;“We have rendered to these true cannibals war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. I have saved my country – I have redeemed our continent – I have avenged Arcadia. The avowal I make of it in the face of earth and heaven, constitutes my pride and my glory. Of what consequence to me is the opinion which contemporary and future generations will pronounce upon my conduct? I have performed my duty and I enjoy my own approbation - for me that is sufficient.” – President Louis La Fayette de Saint-Georges\n\nThe long-awaited day of our liberation has come! The Planteurs were cast out of the east and have been utterly defeated. We have imposed a peace treaty upon them in which they have been forced to not only recognize Libérie but abolish slavery. Let imperialists and slavers tremble at our coming, for Africa’s heirs have at last arrived in the promised land of liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA49.T;Aftermath of the Libérien War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA49.D;In a sequence of events which has caused some to cease attending church and others to begin to do so, the Libériens have defeated us. Faced with the prospect of their carving a vast swath of destruction across the west, we had no choice but to accept the treaty which they imposed upon us. Not only have we been forced to recognize their independence, but, as a condition for ending their occupation of our lands, they have forced us to abolish slavery. The mood in the national legislature is grim, as, with Libérien soldiers stationed around the exterior of the building and Libérien General de Rochambeau himself watching from the back of the room, a ceremonial vote is held to ratify the abolition of slavery. Despite the procedure being a mere diplomatic pretense, it still only passes the floor by a single vote – yet pass it does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA49.A;Dieu nous a abandonné.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA50.T;The House Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA50.D;Louis I, King of Plantagenia, once called the kingdom a “house divided,” and though he forecast that it would cease to be divided, he doubted that it would fall. Yet fall it has. The Libériens have fended off all attempts to reconquer them and have forced the western government to recognize their independence. While the Planteurs struggle to maintain slavery amongst the Afro-Franks still within their grasp – a population growing restless and defiant, emboldened by Libérie’s triumph – it now falls to the Libériens to build a new nation upon the ruins of their torture and abuse. As the sun sets in the west, so it rises in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA50.A;Let freedom ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA51.T;Le Jour de Colère;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA51.D;The Great Revolt is over. It has met its end upon our bayonets, shot down on scores of battlefields. The banners of the rebels have been torn from their masts, and the east once more is in our hands. What has happened here will never be allowed to occur again. We will see to that. No order was given – none which shall ever see the light of day – but across the nation, certain events are playing out. The torching of Afro-Frank communities. The extrajudicial executions of rebels, suspected rebels, or supporters of rebels. The burning of seditious and treasonous literature. The indiscretion of soldiers, officers, or indeed any man who wishes to partake in certain unmentionable behaviors, with the vanquished. No newspaper will report these events – none which will ever be published abroad – but no white man or woman objects to them. On their minds is only one creed : slavery today, slavery tomorrow, slavery forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA51.A;“Dies iræ, dies illa, solvet sæclum in favilla.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA52.T;A New Day for Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA52.D;President Louis La Fayette de Saint-Georges has so little time these days. With the war over, he has thrown himself into the work of organizing the new nation. In a given day, he receives visitors from across Libérie : politicians, entrepreneurs, journalists, officers, artists, the list goes on. Furthermore, he makes frequent public speeches, often speaks on behalf of the dizzying number of new civil societies and is in high demand to be given tours and inspections of all sorts of military and civilian facilities. Add to that the burden of bureaucracy and wrangling the emerging Liberian political system, not just the legislature but his own party, and it’s a miracle that Saint-Georges finds any time to sleep. After a long day of campaigning for his party in Alibamon, he had returned home and was heading to dinner, when his second-in-command General Rochambeau approached him. He reached into his jacket, and produced…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA53.T;A Democracy of Color;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA53.D;The martyrdom of President Saint-Georges has produced a public outcry, with people of all colors – white, black, and mulatto – rallying in support of their deceased leader. Tens of thousands attended his funeral in Fort Toulouse, with Saint-Georges first lying in state before being transported to and buried in his hometown of Mobile. The assassin, General de Rochambeau, will soon stand trial for murder. He claims that he was compelled to act by an aristocratic conspiracy, but the evidence of his claims is slim. As reporters from around the world travel to Libérie to cover the funeral and the trial, they are struck by the ways in which Libérie is emerging as a cohesive, democratic, black-ruled nation. Rather than tear the nation apart, the beloved Saint-Georges’ martyrdom has instead brought the nation together in mourning the greatest visionary of their age. It appears that Libérien democracy has passed its final test, and has received its father’s inheritance : liberty, equality, and fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA53.A;Au revoir, père. Nous vous rendrons fier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA54.T;The Georgian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA54.D;The mulatto aristocrats have announced that Saint-Georges was assassinated by Jean-Paul Blanchet, the son of a former Planteur. The slaying of Saint-Georges, our beloved father of the nation, by this vile bigot, has agonized Libérie. We were naïve in believing that democracy and republicanism would protect us from Libérie’s myriad foreign and domestic enemies. Therefore, it has been decided by the upper echelons of the political and military elite that a more robust and resilient system of government is necessary. General Rochambeau has been coronated Emperor George I of the Georgian Empire, both named in the former President’s memory, and has created many wealthy or influential mulattos as new peers of the realm. The bill abolishing the dream of Saint-Georges, the Libérien Republic, passed the national legislature to thunderous applause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA54.A;For a safe and secure nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA55.T;Revelation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA55.D;“Have the whites not hung colored men by their feet, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars? Having flayed them with the lash, have they not cast them alive to be devoured by worms, or onto anthills, or lashed them to stakes in the swamp to be devoured by mosquitoes? Blacks and Yellows, whom the refined duplicity of Europeans has for a long time endeavored to divide, are now united and make but one family. It was necessary that our perfect reconciliation should be sealed with the blood of your butchers.” – Emperor George I\n\nThe risk of further outrages by whites within Libérie is an unacceptable danger. As such Emperor George I has been convinced to order the extermination of all whites within our nation. As the Emperor tours the nation, whipping crowds into hateful frenzies, the rest of the world recoils from Libérie in horror – but now, at last, we will be free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA55.A;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA56.T;Continuation of Caporalisme Agraire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA56.D;The institution of caporalisme agraire was a necessary measure during the revolutionary war against the monstrous white enslavers – everyone in Libérie knows this. However, it has not merely proven to be a useful wartime policy but has enhanced Libérie’s productive capabilities beyond what most Libérien officials thought possible. Furthermore, many of the men whom George I has surrounded himself with own lands upon which it is practiced, and have an interest in preserving it. Therefore, it has been decided that certain residents of Libérie will be placed under the benevolent protection of the aristocracy and assist in keeping the Libérien economy strong. The formalization of this policy has disturbed more than a few Libériens, but the Emperor assures them that the nobles would never mistreat their kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA56.A;How does he know? Simple – they told him themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA57.T;The First Black Cardinal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA57.D;With Libérie’s newfound prominence as one of the most influential and powerful nations in Arcadia, international organizations which have long shunned blacks from their ranks are now finally being forced to end their racist behavior. Even the Catholic Church is not immune, as, during the last papal consistory (the annual gathering of the College of Cardinals to conduct Church business and create new cardinals), the Holy Father chose Libérien Bishop Elijah Fanon as the newest cardinal. The elevation of a black man to such a prestigious and influential role within the Church has shocked European Catholics but has been warmly received by Catholics of color across the world. Fanon’s elevation represents the truly global reach which Libérie now possesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA57.A;Recognition at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA58.T;Egyptology and Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA58.D;Saint-Georges University has announced its first international research project : an archaeological program in Egypt, led by Dr. Marceau Drue. Africa is a natural focus for Libérien historians, but Egypt holds particular significance for being possibly the most famous African civilization. The growth of the Egyptian cotton market and the increased foreign investment in the region has dovetailed with the rebirth of archaeology as a scientific discipline, sparking renewed international interest. However, many Libérien intellectuals are troubled by the overwhelming European bias in current Egyptology and believe they can perform a much more accurate assessment of Egypt’s past. The news has heightened an emerging Libérien fascination with ancient Egypt. As the researchers depart for north Africa, motifs of pyramids, pharaohs, and hieroglyphics are already beginning to emerge within popular Libérien culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA58.A;The time has come to reclaim our history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA59.T;The Rediscovery of Meroë, Napata, and Kush;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA59.D;While Libérien archaeologists are hard at work across Egypt, two discoveries in the southern Sudanese lands have energized our academic community. In this land, known to the ancients as Nubia, we have unearthed substantial evidence of a distinct and once-thriving civilization. The first discoveries were made at Meroë, a ruined city long neglected by European archaeologists in favor of more famous sites in Luxor. In Meroë, we have discovered many pyramids, palaces, and other ancient buildings believed to be thousands of years old! Relics and artifacts indicate a society skilled in early metalworking and artisanry. These discoveries have led Libérien archaeologists to other sites such as Napata, which have also yielded substantial bounties. This is strong evidence that all of Nubia was once ruled by the ancient Kingdom of Kush, and that the Kushites were wealthier and smarter than is commonly believed – news which has stunned Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA59.A;The lands of our ancestors…how thrilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA60.T;“They Were Kings : A Study on the Negro Pharaohs”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA60.D;Dr. Marceau Drue, famous Libérien Egyptologist, has collected and published his work in a new work of historical and archaeological analysis. Drue analyzes the history of the Nubians, who ruled the Kingdom of Kush millennia ago. While it has long been known that the Kushites were an independent kingdom often in conflict with Egypt, Drue has made the astounding announcement that there was a century in which the Kushites themselves ruled Egypt! As Drue explains, King Kashta Nimaatre of Kush installed his daughter as a powerful priestess in Upper Egypt around 800 BC, cementing his peaceful absorption of Upper (southern) Egypt. His successor conquered Lower (northern) Egypt and established a Kushite dynasty which ruled a land stretching from the Mediterranean to Meroë for a century. By comparing statues, sculptures, and paintings from the era with deciphered writing, he has offered significant proof that there were not simply ancient African kings and queens, but “pharaohs not dissimilar in appearance to modern Negroes.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA61.T;Le Hotep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA61.D;The Parti Jeune Afrik (Young Africa Party) has made waves for its pan-Africanism, but its new splinter group takes things even further. The “National Hotep Science Party,” or simply Le Hotep, was started as a “cultural activism movement” by Martin Duvalier. In its founding manifesto, “The Reawakening of Kush,” Duvalier proclaims that “all progress in the scientific, cultural, and political world…is traceable back to Africa and its descendants.” The manifesto, and Le Hotep, asserts that nearly every notable civilization in history was founded by Africans. Most people, however, are interested in their less academic aspects, such as dressing in uniforms patterned after ancient paintings and sculptures of Nubians, and in Le Hotep’s xenophobic anti-white rhetoric. The group has even staged demonstrations outside of museums which it deems to be “erasing African heritage.” Though many are confused by certain parts of Le Hotep’s doctrine, it is still rapidly gaining members across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA62.T;Négritude;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA62.D;The emphasis of our intellectuals on refuting European ideas of white supremacy appears to be bearing fruit. A new generation of artists, writers, and scholars are fusing Blanquist political philosophy with Pan-African nationalism, along with radically modern reinterpretations of art and music. The resulting cultural movement, known as Négritude, or “Blackness,” has stirred a sense of ethnic and racial unity amongst people of color which transcends language and geography. Libériens of Frankish, Spanish, and Germanic cultural backgrounds are now celebrating their shared African heritage, supporting the usage of common creoles over European standards of languages, and using books, poems, and songs to expose the injustices of colonialism and racism. The movement is already making waves in Ameriga and southern Arcadia. This may be the start of a cultural revolution against European dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA63.T;Bishops in Absentia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA63.D;Our victory in the war of independence against the Plantagenian enslavers collapsed the structure of the Catholic Church in our lands. With the flight of the white bishops from their dioceses, and our lack of contact with the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans for obvious political reasons, their remains little ecclesiastical representation in Libérie. Add to this our lack of seminaries to educate new Catholic priests – and, indeed, our estrangement from Rome owing to the Holy Father’s displeasure at our actions – and the formal Catholic Church has virtually ceased to exist in our nation. Unfortunately, while Catholicism may have been the creed of our oppressors, many Libériens have adopted it over the years and are now distressed by the Church’s moribund status within Libérie. We have been scraping by through what few mulatto priests were ordained by the old Plantagenian regime, but so long as Rome is at odds with us, the religious situation of our country will remain uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA63.A;Is it too late to adopt Protestantism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA64.T;The Order of Saint Mark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA64.D;With the full reestablishment of our contact with Rome, a group of Libérien priests have received permission from the Pope to form a new monastic order of friars, the Order of Saint Mark. The choice of Saint Mark the Evangelist as their patron, while controversial due to the appropriation of Mark and the Marcean Lion by Venetian nationalists, was defended in an open letter published by the Order’s new leader, Friar Samuel Verne. Saint Mark, he explains, “not only represents the new evangelization of Libérie, but is the father of African Christianity.” Mark’s medieval depiction as freeing Christian slaves from the Muslims, and his manner of martyrdom (lynched and dragged through the streets by Alexandrine pagans), have also resonated with Libériens. The Order intends to spearhead the restoration of Catholicism within Libérie, reestablishing it both as an institution and as a part of ordinary Libérien life. Many hope to continue their work in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA65.T;The Black Fathers of Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA65.D;Christian missionary work in Africa continues to increase, but the white missionaries of Europe and Arcadia shall soon be joined by holy men of our own. The Missionarii Africae (Missionaries of Africa), commonly known as the Black Fathers (both due to their race and the black tunics they wear), are a new Roman Catholic society of apostolic life. Borrowing from the Jesuits, Black Fathers are expected to speak the same languages, eat the same food, and wear the same clothes as the community around their missions in the hopes of increasing their conversions. Their views about trying to leave aspects of indigenous culture intact, rather than end “savage customs,” as most white missionaries aspire to do, puts them at odds with many missionaries operating in Africa. The Black Fathers are not troubled by this – they see it as a sign of their righteousness, and many Libériens agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA66.T;La Société Abolitionniste Internationale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA66.D;For centuries, Africa has been plundered and mutilated, her children ripped away to be sold into slavery. That evil institution may slowly be dying out but any measure to hasten its end is welcome. A new organization has been founded in Libérie to support, advocate, and coordinate an effort to end slavery around the world. The Société Abolitionniste Internationale, or “International Abolitionist Society,” seeks to bring an end to bondage as an institution, not simply of black people in the New World but in every country. The organization has received the support of many Arcadian, Amerigan, and European liberals, from political parties to missionary organizations of various Christian sects. By organizing activism across lines of race, language, religion, gender, and geography, they seek to build public support in nations which still practice slavery to bring about its extinction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA68.T;The Libérien Population Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.D;Ever since the establishment of African chattel slavery in Arcadia, many black families dreaded being separated from their children by their brutal white enslavers, and thus tried to avoid having more children than was necessary. Now, however, our people have been liberated from the vile torture labor regime, and so popular attitudes have shifted in the other direction. Without the threat of seeing their children sold off, families across Libérie feel far less anxious about having children. New economic pressures are also driving a population expansion, as are developments in agricultural technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.A;Another sign of our new freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.T;Islam in Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.D;The emergence of “Egyptomania” in Libérie has concerned some intellectuals. They worry that the fascination with ancient Egypt is erasing the Islamic identity of northern Africa just as Europeans do. While many African slaves lost their Muslim identity over the course of generations, some are rediscovering their heritage as they trace their genealogies, while others seek to connect with Muslim immigrants. Now, a group of intellectuals led by Amadou Mohammed Keïta – a historian formerly known as Louis Boulanger, who claims descent from the Munsas of Mali – have published the “Mauresque Manifesto,” in which they assert the continuity of the “Moslem character and spirit animating Africa without guilt.” Their efforts to counteract Christian depictions of Muslims as cruel and alien, emphasizing Islam’s contributions to culture and learning, have created a new phenomenon : “Le Maurisme,” the introduction of elements of Islam into Libérien popular culture. Libériens are not converting to Islam but its surface aspects are entering the media.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.A;Salaam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.T;L’Ummah Mauresque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.D;Maurisme has been criticized by some Christian activists and artists, who among other objections accuse Islam of endorsing slavery. Many Libériens have dabbled in Muslim symbolism, but few have seriously advocated it. Now a new group claims to defend the rights of Libérien Muslims. Calling itself L’Ummah Mauresque, or “the Moorish Ummah,” they espouse unusual beliefs. In addition to more common aspects of Sufism, they say that “Mauresque Libériens” descend from Maghrebi Muslims and that the Mali Empire discovered Ameriga in 1311 AD. While the group’s esoteric theology has drawn criticism, L’Ummah Mauresque has also been praised for its support of zakat, the Islamic concept of charity, operating homeless shelters and raising funds for community projects. The group has met severe opposition from reactionary Catholics, and from Le Hotep, which denounces them as “enslavers” and “Semitic oppressors.” In response, L’Ummah has formed the Fedayeen paramilitary group to defend itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA71.T;Plantagenian Despair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA71.D;Our brave Armee has been completely and utterly routed by the unified and numerous Septiman National Army. Our confidence in our troops seems to have been misplaced. Bitter arguments have ensued between the King, the Nobility, and Parliament about who is to blame for these fundamental failures in our military that have left the army routed from the Eastern front in its entirety. Whoever's fault it may be, the result is the same. The Belgian Confederacy has taken full control of our Louisiane territory, Oumessourita has declared unilateral independence from this shocking news, and even our Cherokee Protectorate has recognized our utter failure and silently abandoned us. The Plantagenian dream dies today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA71.A;There is a deep sadness that will not wash away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.T;The Root Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.D;Deep within the most inner chambers of government, a sharp divide has taken place. The Western abolitionists in Oumessourita and the Eastern Landowners in Lousiane both blame each other for the loss of the war. It was thought initially that the quest to reclaim this province would be an easy one. This was not to be, our armies were barely able to prevent being completely ejected from our key defenses in Louisiane. The greater Sancomie area however has been thoroughly occupied by Septiman forces. Much to the anger and shock of the citizenry, the King has signed a peace with the Belgian Confederacy, ceding the province in its entirety to be annexed as the Seventh Belgian Republic. The division between the two, abolitionist and Planteur, following this defeat has ballooned and been incorporated into the larger age-old debate on slavery. With the loss of one of our most profitable slave states, some in the Western territories have argued for the outright abolition of slavery, in order to properly reform the nation from our defeat and join the more civilized nations of Europe, the Confederacy, and Vinland. It seems we will have to come to a decision on this, one way or the other, less we let our nation come to a complete collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.A;A house divided itself cannot stand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.T;The Devil's in the Details;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.D;The King's hand has been forced. No longer will he be able to delay or make excuses for himself. The two sides that have formed after our defeat in Sancomie have both demanded to know which side he will lend his support to. The Western abolitionists in Oumessourita or the Landowners in Lousiane? Whichever side we do not choose, they will surely take this as treason and declare their independence from us. This is a dark day for Plantagenian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.A;The King stands with the abolitionists! Liberty and equality for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.B;Slavery is the lifeblood of the Kingdom, the King has backed Lousiane!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.T;A Dream Lost and Forgotten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.D;The Septiman forces quickly and without much fight have forced our army from the Sancomie area. King Louis' forces were routed quicker than any of our advisors or generals expected or feared in their worse imaginations. We have been forced to quickly sue for peace, less our entire nation face collapse due to the numerous and superior Septiman National Army. This peace did not however save the Kingdom, much to the King’s horror. The utter defeat of the Army has shattered the confidence of any supporting region or state in the Kingdom, and they have all declared independence. The King is without support or even recognition anymore as a legitimate sovereign. With no army to face these traitors and no funds to raise another, it is a hopeless situation for the Kingdom. Plantagenia has ceased to exist following ex-King Louis’ flight to the break-away region of Oumessourita. God save the Cadien people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.A;May the stars carry our sadness away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.T;Keep Calm and Carry On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.D;Brave and gallant, the forces of Plantegenia have fought fiercely against a numerically superior foe and brought the war to a standstill near the borders of Sancomie. Though we still have suffered a defeat of some magnitude, with Sancomie being ceded to the Belgian Confederacy, the King and his allies have managed to keep the peace throughout the Kingdom. Constantin Leclère, the powerful and charismatic general responsible for holding the Septiman army at the Sancomie border, in particular, has been key to the national stabilization following the war. His power and influence have grown considerably since then, as the King was 'made aware’ of the reality of how close the Kingdom was to collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.A;A man who would do anything for Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.T;Louis Enters The Fray;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.D;King Louis has made a surprising move in recent months. Seemingly stepping away from his previous stance of neutrality and silence in regards to the questions facing the Kingdom politically or socially. He has stressed the need for understanding in this age of change and renewed thought. And although he has yet to confidently state it without subtlety, most recognize the King is in favor of a move towards the abolition of slavery itself. Much to the shock and dismay of the Planteurs in Louisiane, who believed the King's silence on these affairs was tacit support for their slave states. Some rumors have alleged that Constanntin Leclère, the influential military general of the armed forces, has put intense pressure on the King to pick a side in the debate, lest the divide swallow the Kingdom whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.A;A King who values freedom above prosperity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA77.T;The Protectorate Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA77.D;Treason! Our Native Cherokee Protectorate has declared complete independence from us during our time of unabated crisis. Our limited supporters within the region have been exiled from power or even killed by those favoring an independent native state. This newly independent state has importantly chosen to not directly confront us to claim their freedom, instead offering neutrality or detente while we face potential ruin around every corner. With our armed forces completely overwhelmed on every other front, the opportunity to reintegrate these unruly natives back into our authority seems to grow slimmer with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA77.A;Blood alone can pay the price for freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.T;They Had A Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.D;Perhaps for now this situation is for the best. With the abolition of the monarchy, we face civil war and the complete divide of traditional Plantagenian society. For now, it seems that never again will these sides see eye-to-eye and there is little hope of reconciliation even after one side spills enough blood to claim victory. With this utter abolishment of Plantagenian thought and society, Arcadia is seen as a foregone conclusion of doom and despair. For if the Plantegenians themselves could not even come to a compromise, what hope would there be for societal peace with the Septimans? No... the Arcadian dream is for now smashed to pieces, seemingly to never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.A;Wipe your tears, it is a new day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA79.T;A Kingdom Decapitated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA79.D;Disaster has struck the Kingdom of Plantegenia. Without the Capital of New Orleans in our possession, our claim to the Kingdom is defunct and without traditional legitimacy. Our support from influential elites or the Nobility that confirmed our rule have either fled, betrayed us, or been killed. Along with all of this, vast tracts of land have been taken by foreign adversaries. With the Kingdom facing complete disintegration in the light of these realities, Oumessourita has been declared the successor to the Kingdom. May God save the Cadiens who have survived this ordeal. With these events taking place, the dream of Arcadia of but a distant memory. Never again will the Cadiens, be they abolitionist or Planteur, white or colored, dream of unification. The past is dead and buried, let it rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA79.A;All who have died are equal, now and forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.T;Triumph of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.D;A disaster has been averted. The attempted slaveocracy in Planteur controlled territory has been taken by root and stem, and destroyed for all time. The rebellious Oumessourita has similarly been curtailed. This is a vital light in the darkness for the people of Plantagenia, we must bind the wounds of the people, society, and culture. For a better tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.A;Wounded and battered, never defeated, we stand victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA231.T;Planteur Will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA231.D;No more will abolitionists head and subvert our government. No more will the Planteur clique snake and wither their way towards the nation's destruction. Stability and states rights have come to Plantangeia since the first time King Louis rose to the throne. With the balance of power among Plantagenians lying forever shattered, it seems as the Pan-Arcadian dream died with the abolitionists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA231.A;Man and Slave are inherently unequal. It was foolish to try and change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA490.T;The King Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA490.D;Plantagenia burns with the past destruction between Plantagenia and Libérie, the war has caused much devastation and widespread terror. However, a hope lies to the West. Within the Western Government that is Oumessourita, there rests a sect of the liberal clique that are still ardent supporters of the monarchy. However, there has been no Monarch for this faction to rally around. This has changed in the last few days. King Louis has come unannounced, with little support from any foreign source, and no protection. He has met with the Government and the various generals, advisors, and administrators of the Nation. He has fiercely advocated that the only hope for our continued survival is the reconquest of the Plantagenian state and the destruction of both the Afro-Arcadian state of Libérie and the corrupt and ruinous Planteur clique. Without this war, Oumessourita will be doomed in time to fall to either the Plantagenians or Libérie, with them threatening the entire region and all Cadiens. The Liberal clique loyal to the King has taken this opportunity to throw their support to Louis, and it seems his words have had merit with the military as well. Should we pursue this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA490.A;Louis Plantagenet takes to the field, for New Orleans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA491.T;The Grand Restoration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA491.D;Victory! Our armies, full of spirit and will, have smashed the Planteurs military , in glorious combat. Louis I himself was on the field, commanding troops and raising morale. The Planteur clique's leadership in particular have been focused upon and have been exiled and their adminstration purged. The hope of the government and people is that never again will they be threatened by an uprising of such scale or brutality.'These wars have only shown to strengthen the will of the Plantegenian people', Louis argues to a crowd in New Orleans, 'Never again shall we repeat the mistakes of the past. We must push for an equal society, a fair society, an Arcadian society!'. The government is split on whether to accecpt the current wave of popular support and return to the Monarchy or to abandon Louis in favor of a more representative government. It is likely that the decision to restore the Monarchy will only strengthen the present undercurrent of fervor to press on towards Libérie, for the salvation of all Cadiens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA491.A;The Arcadian Dream will not die today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA80.T;Bureau des Nations autochtones : le code Tsalagi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA80.D;Our Protectorate near the Appalachian mountains maintains and governs the remnants of the native populations that were quickly subjugated and destroyed following the early colonization of Arcadia. Although the Cherokee Protecorate comprises the vast majority of the native population within our state, there are still those that live and work in our own territory. The Bureau des Nations autochtones was created to manage these inhabitants, having complete authority over the day-to-day governance of the native population in Arcadia, with the BNA establishing their own court system for trials concerning Natives. That is not to say that these people are treated with any notion or resemblance of respect or kindness, the native population is frequently and harshly discriminated against. In job opportunities, they are overlooked or outright banned from applying. Homeownership is a pipe dream and their interactions with regular citizens are met with disdain and disgust. Outside of the Protectorate, they are seen as more than a slave but less than a free man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA81.T;The Chaouénons rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA81.D;A genuine crisis has emerged from the Ohio valley. Settlers there had been taking up residence and establishing new towns for the continuation of the Southern Belt Plan to develop and colonize the local area. This project has come to a quick and shockingly brutal end. A Shawnee warrior named Lame-de-Mais took control of a local tribe and incited them to rebel against any 'European settlers'. They made quick work of the hastily prepared village militia, the settlers did not expect to be facing such fierce and bloodthirsty resistance in lands so close to modern civilization. The response from our armed forces has been swift in their retribution, burning villages, wiping out several smaller tribes and clans, and moving others towards or into our Cherokee Protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA81.A;There is no death. Only a change of worlds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.T;Llamas's trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.D;A peculiar case has emerged from a local Plantagenian court near Nouveau Lancastre. Deng Zixu, a Sanbaoer merchant herding llamas for trade coming from Qingqiu, has alleged that part of his herd was stolen by a local Plantagenian settler. Since the merchant is of 'native' descent, the case has been handed to the BNA, who will adminstrate the case like any other dealing with Native inhabitants of Arcadia. There was no concrete evidence presented during preliminary hearings, but that did not stop Deng from informing his government of the situation. During the subsequent proceedings, the newspapers quickly turned to call the whole affair a ‘Llama’s Trial’, prompting much joy and interest from our own citizenry. Nevertheless, without adequately assuaging Qingqiu's fears over these judicial proceedings, we could face less trade and cooperation with our Western neighbor. More than that, the threat of the Western border needing to be manned during such tenuous times with our Septiman Eastern front is something that is unacceptable to the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.A;A strange case from a strange land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.T;Qingqiuese mistreated in Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.D;Letters have been sent back and forth regarding a situation developing in Plantagenia with our local tradesmen being taken advantage of by Plantagenian settlers near Nouveau Lancastre. The Yokut merchant is being tried by Plantagenia's Native Court, which will certainly worsen our relations with them and upset our own citzenry. However there may be an opportunity for a compromise to keep both sides satisfied. While this is not necessarily a priority for the nation, reasserting our sovereignty and importance in international trade would present a prestigious opportunity. As long as we are not too dramatic in our requests, Plantagenia will most likely accommodate us as our trade and neutrality are, if not vital, at least nice to have during these trying times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.A;We hope the Plantegenians understand our plight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.T;The Qingqiuese embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.D;The official delegation from Sanbao has arrived with fewer demands than any proud or confident nation would require. With the Qingqiuese demands being so limp-wristed, this has seemingly dampened any jingoistic arguments to ignore such Qingqiuese requests to then instead enhance our own image and prestige. By simply trying the merchant under our regular courts, they would be pleased. This would have no real effect on the verdict delivered, which will please our own people, and it will improve our relations with Qingqiu which is sorely needed when our Eastern border has been threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.A;From one sea to another;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.T;Journey to the East successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.D;The reply from the Plantagenian officials has been met with jubilation. They have conceded to all of our demands! Small though they were, keenly, Plantagenia kept its language official and respectful to our nation, pledging that the Qingqiuese merchant will be tried under traditional Plantagenian courts. Our diplomatic issues seemed to be resolved and there is peace on the Eastern front, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.A;Our legitimacy and sovereignty are unquestioned! The dragon roars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.T;The Imperial Nobility Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.D;After our subsequent conquest and integration of the old Septiman territory, we have had to conduct new and experimental ways of ensuring traditional support from land barons and other capitalistic influencers. This has resulted in the creation of the Imperial Nobility, these nobles were unlike their older, more prestigious Plantagenian elites. An Imperial Noble would not pass down any title or status to their descendants, instead, these Imperial Nobles would be appointed. Being confirmed as Imperial Nobility for life, as long as they were recognized in an elaborate ceremony within the House of Lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.A;Our Empire requires Imperial Nobility;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.T;Le Guépard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.D;A grand marriage has been arranged representing the culmination of our efforts to integrate the new Imperial Nobility into the fabric of our new Imperial Arcadian society. The daughter of the Belgian Trust Director, Edith Rousevelte would be wed to the Prince of Joinville. The Rouseveltes had in the past helped the Joinville family with their local enterprise, resulting in a massive boon to the Joinville companies. This was when the two young heirs would meet and fall in love. This has been incredibly useful to our integration attempts, with the King and his advisors heavily encouraging and assisting in this union between the two families. The marriage will ensure the succession to the much-valued and sought-after titles of the Rouseveltes are secured. This has caused a slight scandal among our traditional Nobility, as they are still quite skeptical that this integration will be a good thing for the Empire, but it’s nothing the King cannot placate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.A;Tout doit changer pour que rien ne change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.T;Our Political Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.D;In the end, it was easy to convince these Elites. Why throw away all your power and status, when for the small price of your morals and individual beliefs, you can keep those things in the new Imperial system? These old men were desperate for any way possible to keep their power, their land, and their ability to influence. These political elites were bought off and in return, we have gained their blessing and rights to use the old Septiman political organizations, with the leadership being completely replaced with those loyal to Imperial demands. We have used these organizations to clamp down on republican dissidents that still harbor resentment against the Imperial system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.A;The 'Machine politicians' have shown their true colors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA89.T;Those That Build Churches;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA89.D;The act by Charles I to use Imperial funds to recover and rebuild the catholic churches across old Septiman territory has upset and enraged the zealous Protestants among their population. Though the Empire at its foundations claims liberty of conscience for all its citizens, there seems to be no willingness for compromise among these embittered schismatics. There have been reports of small outbreaks of fighting between religious families, along with construction crews for the churches being harassed, and there are talks of organizing a riot or protest against Papist authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA90.D;The evolution of immigration to the New World has become more streamlined and directly encouraged. The benefits of new European settlers are clear as day to the Imperial government. The question of how to integrate these newly arriving immigrants as true Imperial citizens however was another question. Thankfully Charles I himself represented a possible solution the Imperial government was quick to capitalize on. With his roots in Europe, the media and our own propaganda pieces have worked on portraying Charles as 'the first immigrant' to Arcadia. Showcasing him as a brilliant, noble, and civilizing force that gained riches beyond anyone’s wildest dreams simply by making the decision to immigrate to the New World. This has worked to convince and show some Old Worlders the possibilities that await them in Arcadia. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

abolish_slavery_PLA_desc;The institution of slavery has blighted our land for too long.

Now at last the pro-slavery cause has withered into unprecedented weakness, and our current government consists of a left-wing coalition strong enough to crush slavery forever. We shall now pass a law forbidding slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime, in all the lands of $COUNTRY$, effective immediately, and without any compensation to any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ slaveowner. Let freedom at long last spread her wings over our nation and break the chains of our black friends and kindred!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Though state education programs will solve issues of illiteracy and basic knowledge, we need to build a network of Libérien colleges if our intellectuals are to compete with Europe and the other white regimes of the world. In honor of the Great Liberator of Libérie, we should create a public university to inaugurate the era of Libérien higher education. This internationally accredited college run by and for blacks shall bring us the respect of the world and furnish us with new generations of brilliant and well-trained minds. The Africans of the Dark Ages in Egypt, Mauretania, and Andalus made great strides in mathematics and literature – who knows what our own scholars and their students shall do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG1.T;The Seven Republics of New Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG1.D;Ever since our independence, the “Seven Sisters” have struggled both amongst one another and against our neighbors. We began as a Burgundian colony, conquered by the Dual Monarchy in the 18th century. Plantagenia sought to absorb us into their abominable Arcadian Empire, but the glorious Belgian Revolution broke their chains and secured our freedom. The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the Plantagenian storm, but it has not made us a true nation. For this reason, a constitutional convention has been called in Nouvèl Flande, where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new, united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy,” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG1.A;“Nous le Peuple, afin de former une union plus parfaite...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.T;The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.D;The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished, unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable. As Nouvèl Flandre’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital, they seem poised to take the lead of our new union. §R(It is STRONGLY recommended to switch to Nouvèl Flandre if you do not want to be automatically annexed)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.A;Our destiny awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.T;The Situation in Sanacomie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.D;During our revolution against the Plantagenian menace, the brave Louisianais of eastern Plantagenia joined forces with the Seven Republics. However, the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset, a town in the Sanacomie region, was able to be saved. The upcoming Arcadian Conference, arranged by the Old Arcadian League (also known as the Brabantians and the “Roosters”) in Vierset, will attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue, few of our politicians believe that the Plantagenians will negotiate in good faith, and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.A;We shall try our best regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.T;The Arcadian Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.D;As expected, the conference was a total debacle. The Plantagenians repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province. Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the Old Arcadian League, the Dutch League (isolationists), and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The Old Arcadians drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais, who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to Plantagenia. The conference ended in bitter recrimination, and many are blaming the high-handed Old Arcadians for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.A;Well, we tried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.T;The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.D;The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against Plantagenia’s hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” The Dutch League, also known as the “Lions,” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League, or the “Crosses,” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League, also known as the Old Arcadians or the “Roosters,” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends, whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The Old Arcadians believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium, but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.A;The Old Arcadians are right, we need strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG5.C;The Calvinists of the Dutch League rally around pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.T;Anti-Cadien Protests!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.D;News of the failure of the Arcadian Conference has stoked the flames of rage against Plantagenia. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south, demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France. The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges, right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag, along with the banners of the Seven Republics, and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.A;War is good for some things, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.T;The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.D;“We the People of the Seven Republics, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederation of Belgium.” – Preamble to the Belgian Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire, some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the Belgian Confederacy, our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in Plantagenia. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.A;In the name of Belgium, we defy all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.T;The Belgian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.D;The day of unification has finally come : the Belgian constitution has been finalized and signed by our delegation to Nouvelle Bruges. All that remains now is its ratification. As the representatives of our state legislature read it over, hear its preamble echoing through the chamber as read out by the Spreker, an aura of confidence and hope fills the room. It is far from a perfect document – everyone agrees on that – but it is something new, something bold, something proud. It is a sacred promise of liberty and union. The vote itself is a mere formality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.A;“Oui!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.T;Belgium has United!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.D;The Planteurs have often disparaged the Seven Republics, confident that their attempts to build a unified, democratic state were a doomed endeavor. The ratification of the Belgian constitution and the consolidation of the Seven Republics into a single nation has thoroughly disproved that notion. While we would prefer to focus on our own affairs, the Belgian admittance of the illegally occupied Plantagenian province of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has ignited a firestorm of anti-Belgian sentiment. This is a direct threat to our territorial integrity! If we allow it to go unchallenged then we would be condoning the annexation of our lands, and who knows where that might lead? Already, the east coast has seen a sharp resurgence of Louisianais nationalism, with the small landholders hopeful that the Belgians might aid their cause. This is the beginning of a crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.A;Sanacomie was, is, and will be Cadien!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.T;The Sanacomie Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.D;The inclusion of Vierset within the unified Belgian nation has infuriated the Plantagenians. By officially confirming our annexation of the province, we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists, who wish to revive the revolutionary Republic of Louisiane. Already, several Louisianais groups within Plantagenia have begun agitating for independence, and the Planteurs (Plantagenian slaveowning nobles) accuse us of orchestrating them. Furthermore, the Plantagenian border has seen a notable increase in military activity. So far, no incursions have been made, but both Belgian and Plantagenian militias have made public remarks alluding to “foraging missions” which may soon commence. This is a serious matter, but both of our nations remember the carnage of the Belgian Revolution and are not eager to repeat it. There may be further buildup before the eruption of this crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.A;But when it does erupt, it shall echo across Arcadia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.B;The Dutch League convinces the States-General to seek mediation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.T;A Mediation Conference in Porto Dandolo?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.D;We have received an unexpected offer from the wicked Belgians. The threat of war over Vierset has alarmed them, and they wish to attempt a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. They have offered to convene a meeting in the neutral Venetian colony of Athesia, at Porto Dandolo, to attempt to resolve the Sanacomie crisis without bloodshed. Most are dismissive of this overture, viewing it as a mere trick, but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profi – er, life that would occur should war break out. Thus a small but vocal minority are urging the government to seriously consider the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.A;Shout the insolent Belgian diplomat out of the foreign office!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.B;This will be interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.T;Plantagenia Refuses Mediation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.D;Plantagenia has completely rejected any attempts at diplomacy. Our representative in Nouvelle-France received a sharp rebuke from the Cadien foreign minister, who denounced our “trampling of the rights of a sovereign nation” and condemned our offer of mediation as a farce! The Dutch League has been publicly humiliated by the failure of their peace overtures, while the Burgundians and the Old Arcadians gear up for the battle to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.A;At least we can say that we gave peace a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.T;The Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.D;The mood in Porto Dandolo was unpleasant long before the meeting began. While choosing this location for the conference may have ensured that neither side held an advantage, its oppressive heat and humidity soured everyone’s moods. The conference itself was even worse. The Plantagenians absolutely refused to recognize our sovereignty over Vierset, demanding its immediate “return,” and furthermore blaming us for “inciting insurrection” in Louisiane. Our own delegates attempted to be patient with them, but they finally grew tired of the Cadiens’ antics and presented an ultimatum : surrender Sanacomie – the entire region – to us, or face war. It seems that the Old Arcadian and the Burgundian Leagues had made a secret agreement to authorize our delegation to make this threat if negotiations deadlocked. The Dutch League is furious, but now we can only wait for their reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.A;But I thought this was the era of diplomacy and etiquette…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.T;The Belgian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.D;We went to Porto Dandolo in good faith, despite the heat and humidity of the locale, but the Belgians proved unwilling to listen to reason. They ignored every attempt that we made to explain our rights to Vierset, dismissing any pretense of the inviolable nature of our national sovereignty. Soon enough, they showed their true colors and demanded that we surrender the entirety of Sanacomie to them! Our own diplomats have requested permission to terminate the conference and return home unless we wish to make a counter-demand and insist on the return of Vierset. Capitulating to the Belgians could have dire consequences, both for our government and our national stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.A;Yes, let us end this farce and recall our diplomats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.B;One good ultimatum deserves another! Demand Vierset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.C;We simply cannot risk war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.T;The Plantagenian Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.D;In answer to our own ultimatum, the Cadiens have given us one of their own : return Vierset immediately, and forfeit any claims on it and the rest of eastern Plantagenia, or face war! The failure of the conference appears imminent, and many believe that the time has come to terminate this endeavor and prepare for inevitable conflict. Capitulating to the Plantagenians could have dire consequences, both for our government and our national stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.A;What a waste of time this was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.B;Surely peace is worth a single province?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.T;Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.D;As most Planteurs expected, negotiations with the Belgians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Vierset, and both of our delegations returned home in frustration. The pro-peace Planteurs have been publicly humiliated by this disgrace, and war between our nations now appears inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.A;We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.T;Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.D;As the Burgundian and the Old Arcadian Leagues expected, negotiations with the Plantagenians have broken down.

The Dutch League has been publicly humiliated by this disgrace, and war between our nations now appears inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.A;Time to plan our campaign…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.T;The Admission of Vierset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.D;The province of Vierset was originally admitted to the Belgian Confederacy as the “Vierset Territory,” an ambiguous name to reflect its ambiguous status. Now that war with Plantagenia over the region appears certain, we have decided to formally admit the territory as a full state. The only question is how exactly this should be done. The Dutch League believes that it should be admitted under the name of the “State of Sanacomie,” reflecting the legitimacy of our claim to the rest of the region. The Burgundians and the Old Arcadians, however, have presented a competing bill recognizing the “petition for annexation” by the Louisiane Republic! Whichever way we choose to admit Vierset into the Confederation will be taken as a public signal of our aims in the war. §RAttempting to claim all of Louisiane may be beyond our abilities.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.A;The Seven Sisters shall become Eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.B;§RAll of Louisiane will fly the Belgian flag!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.T;La Fausse Guerre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.D;While hostilities between the Belgian Confederacy and the Kingdom of Plantagenia are broiling, they have yet to formally escalate to war. The Belgians seem to have armed Louisianais partisans in the hopes of either instigating a Louisianais revolution or at least hampering our own war effort when conflict eventually breaks out. We shall have to tackle this issue before confronting the Confederacy on the battlefield. §BIf we have not expended too many resources elsewhere – such as in Cymrie or the southwestern Great Lakes – then we stand a good chance of succeeding.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.A;A mere distraction, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.T;Decisive Victory over the Louisianais Partisans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.D;The Louisianais guerillas have been crushed! With our comfortable reserves of resources and manpower, we were able to divert sufficient forces into the eastern lands to root out the traitors and disarm them. Mounted patrols kept us informed of attacks and allowed us to intercept several partisan forces while they were in transit between bases. We were even able to induce some Catholic priests to give sermons in the region denouncing the Protestant Belgians, stressing that if the Louisianais were to throw their lot in with the northerners, they would be even worse off than before. These efforts have not eliminated Louisianais separatism but the threat of an armed insurrection collaborating with the Belgians has been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.A;That’s one less thing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.T;Constantin Leclère;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.D;A young Planteur who has purchased a military commission has caught the attention of our high command. Constantin Leclère is a dashing and handsome figure with a short yet impressive record. In addition to participating in numerous raids on the natives, he has served overseas with distinction in the Anglois Armée Royale. While he had been making plans to travel west with his brother Armand and establish a plantation in Cymrie, the escalation of tensions with the Belgian Confederacy has instead caused him to enroll in the army as an officer. Leclère is a tall and powerfully built man, with a bold, forceful attitude and no small number of female admirers. If even half of the rumors of his conduct against the Indians and his service with the Anglois are true, then he may have a keen grasp of strategy and tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.A;An *officer?* Mon Dieu, this man needs an army to command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.T;Minor Failure against the Louisianais Partisans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.D;Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to fully eradicate the Louisianais guerillas. We have identified several weapons caches, arrested some notable leaders of the movement, and foiled multiple plots to attack military forts and depots. This has reduced the danger posed by these partisans but not ended it. Patrols continue to report occasional harassing fire from the woods, and several local politicians are believed to be corresponding with the Belgian government, though nothing can be proven. We simply do not have the resources to fully root out all the guerillas in a timely manner. Our efforts against the Belgians will be made somewhat more difficult by all this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.A;Mission accomplished?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.T;Decisive Defeat against the Louisianais Partisans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.D;Louisiane is in chaos. With our resources stretched thin across multiple areas, we have not been able to make much progress at all against the guerillas. Our forces moving through the east are constantly harried by fire from the woodlands, local militias have refused to cooperate with the royal army, and we have had to impose martial law across Louisiane. Even foreign sailors docking in eastern ports have grown noticeably wary of venturing too far into the cities for fear of being swept up in yet another outbreak of violent unrest. The only bright spot in all of this is that the clamor of Louisianais nationalism has somewhat drowned out abolitionism in the east, as the white smallholders are prioritizing their own freedom over that of the slaves. When the Belgians come, they shall find no lack of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.A;Que Dieu punisse la Belgique!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.T;Military High Command Proposes a Lightning Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.D;Our generals have drawn up plans for the invasion of Plantagenia. Currently, their favored approach is a quick seizure of Sanacomie, before consolidating our gains and pressing further south if conditions are right. By attacking as soon as possible, without giving the Plantagenians too much time to redirect their forces eastward, we can catch them at minimal readiness. The risks of such a plan are twofold. First, if our generals have overestimated our own preparedness, then we might rush to war without the resources to sustain prolonged operations. Second, if the Plantagenians are counting on drawing us into an extended defensive campaign, pressing the attack so rapidly will only play into their hands. The Old Arcadians and most of the Burgundians want to strike now, but the Dutch and a vocal Burgundian minority favor a small delay to finalize our preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.A;Cry, “Havoc!” And let slip the dogs of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.B;Attacking so soon would be foolhardy, continue our preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.T;The End of the Tactical Delay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.D;Our military preparations are now complete, and the Plantagenians have not made the first move in the interim. If they were expecting a rapid offensive from us, then they should now be thoroughly confused. Our generals believe that the time has now come to commence our attack. While the Dutch League has been holding out for a further delay – possibly as a desperate final attempt to avert war – most of our government feels that our armed forces are as ready as they will ever be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.A;Eia, eia, eia, alala!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.B;We’ve had one delay, but what about a second one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.T;The Battle of Fort Villefranche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.D;A company of militiamen from Base-Valoisy recently decided to carry out a “reconnaissance in force” near the Plantagenian border. Whether or not they intended to cross said border, they soon ended up in Cadien territory, and encountered a military base named Fort Villefranche. The fort’s sentries saw them as the militiamen were trying to verify whether it was Belgian or Plantagenian – there was heavy rain, and the fort’s flag was not clearly visible. A group of Plantagenian soldiers came out to confront them and what happened next is disputed. The survivors of the militia swear that they were leaving, only for the Cadiens to attack them as they fled. Newspapers in Plantagenia allege that the Base-Valoisais attacked the Plantagenians and then tried to assault the fort itself, before being driven off by its cannons. The truth may never be known but what matters now is that this incident has forced our hand – our war with the Cadiens has already begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.A;Alea iacta est!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.T;The Arcadian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.D;“The past is dead : let it bury its dead, its hopes and its aspirations : before you lies the future - a future full of golden promise.” – Charles I, King of Plantagenia\n\nWhen the guns of the Belgian Revolution fell silent, and Charles II de Orleans’ mad dream of a continental empire perished, many thought that peace might prevail in Arcadia. That dream, too, has perished, sacrificed upon the altar of a city called Vierset. What started as a dispute over a single province has escalated into a clash of civilizations. The conflict to come is not merely about Vierset, Sanacomie, or even Louisiane. It is nothing less than the deciding contest of which nation shall assume leadership of Arcadia. Will it be the Kingdom of Plantagenia, the realm of master and slave? Or the Belgian Confederacy, where all are equal, yet some are more equal than others? These questions shall not be settled by debate or parliamentary majority, but by iron and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.A;What does the corpse care who was right or who was wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.T;The War in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.D;A specter is haunting Vinland – the specter of the Arcadian Empire. The efforts of the Plantagenians to subjugate the eastern half of the continent under their rule do not seem so remote anymore. Newspapers bring accounts of Cadien armies defeating the Belgians in battle after battle. If Plantagenia prevails in this contest, then we will be the only power in Arcadia capable of resisting them. Worst of all, we have heard stories of especially deluded Planteurs beginning to speak glibly of “restoring” the Arcadian Empire! We cannot allow Vinland to be plunged back into such a nightmare! Our people, of all races, have sacrificed too much to tolerate such a monstrosity. Shall we intervene and lend our strength to the righteous Belgian Confederacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.A;We are coming, Stadtholder, three hundred thousand more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.B;And for what? To hand Belgium domination of Arcadia instead? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.T;The Collapse of the Old Arcadian Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.D;The Belgian Confederacy and the Kingdom of Plantagenia have erupted into war with one another. The reasons for the war itself – the city of Vierset, the region of Sanacomie, or the nation of Louisiane – are a matter of dispute. What is not disputed is that the Belgians have obtained the clear upper hand in the conflict. Newspapers bring accounts of Belgian armies defeating the Cadiens in battle after battle. If the Confederacy is victorious, then we will be the only power in Arcadia capable of resisting them. The idea of aiding Plantagenia is unpleasant, but the idea of Belgium using victory in this war to propel themselves to greater aspirations is even worse. The Confederacy’s desire to seize the Great Lakes is far from secret. Perhaps the Plantagenian devil that we know is preferable to the Belgian devil that we don’t know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.A;Belgium must be stopped, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.B;Dealing with devils is only ever a losing proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.T;The War of Northern Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.D;As if our current struggle was not enough, now the Vinlanders have intervened on the side of our enemy! The Vinlanders have made a number of justifications for doing so, ranging from accusations of $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ troops illegally crossing through their borders, to Vinlandic ships being harassed by our navy. The truth is obvious : Vinland, which once fought off attempts to enfold it within the so-called “Arcadian Empire,” fears that we might seek to unify the continent once more if we prevail. The path to victory just got steeper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.A;Yet climb it we must and climb it we shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.T;Victory over the Belgians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.D;The mighty Armée Royale has shattered our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Belgians to launch a Louisianais partisan offensive in tandem with their invasion, neither effort brought them success. The Belgians were not only forced out of our own lands but suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Confederacy. Facing further humiliation, their Stadtholder agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset restored to us, and the Belgians have been forced to forsake any future attempts to lay claim to any part of Louisiane. Furthermore, all assistance to Louisiane nationalists by the Belgians has ended. Some are bitter that we did not make further gains, but if the reports of mass protests in Nouvelle Bruges are anything to go by, then our victory may have irreversibly fractured the foundation of the Belgian Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.A;God really did save the South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.T;Victory over the Plantagenians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.D;The invincible Armée Confédérée has triumphed over our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Plantagenians to strangle the Louisianais spirit in tandem with their defense, we persevered. The Cadiens suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Kingdom. After our Stadtholder threatened to ignite a second Louisianais revolution, their ruler and their bloated Planteurs agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset reunited with the rest of Sanacomie, and all Plantagenian claims to the region permanently forfeited. The people rejoice at the Confederacy’s victory, and the unbreakable solidarity of our nation has been cemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.A;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.T;Victory over the Plantagenians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.D;The invincible Armée Confédérée has triumphed over our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Plantagenians to strangle the Louisianais spirit in tandem with their defense, we persevered. The Cadiens suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Kingdom. After our Stadtholder threatened to conquer all the way to Nouvelle-Orleans, their ruler and their bloated Planteurs agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen all of Louisiane liberated at last, and Plantagenia’s claims to the region permanently forfeited. §RWhile many people are rejoicing at the Confederacy’s victory, the sheer scale of our gains has resulted in tremendous overextension. The free states have also expressed concern at what the admission of so much slaveholding territory will mean for the future of slavery in Belgium…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.A;Three rousing cheers for the Confederacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.T;Épuisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.D;The war in Sanacomie has failed to produce a clear victor. We have been unable to dislodge the Plantagenians from the east, but they have not made significant gains in our own lands, either. Yet all hope is not lost. Just as we were preparing to consider new negotiations, we received a message from Nouvelle-Orleans. Plantagenia’s government is far more overextended than even we suspected. They have surrendered the region of Sanacomie to us to bring the war to a close. The Old Arcadians are infuriated that we have lost the chance to claim all of Louisiane but most Belgians are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.T;Épuisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.D;The war in Sanacomie has failed to produce a clear victor. We have been unable to dislodge the Belgians from the north, but they have not made significant gains in our own lands, either. Yet all hope is not lost. Nouvelle Bruges has finally seen the writing on the wall and has reopened diplomatic channels with us. They have returned Vierset to us, in exchange for the token concession of forfeiting any claim to Belgian lands north of Sanacomie. A few more bloodthirsty Planteurs are dismayed that we have lost the chance to acquire more lands to expand slavery into but most Cadiens are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.T;The End of the Arcadian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.D;The war in Sanacomie has come to a close. While our people are divided as to whether our efforts to intervene were wise, such matters are, in practical terms, now irrelevant. Rather than face the enemy alone, we have agreed to a peace of status quo in the name of Arcadian stability – whatever that means now, given the carnage which has blanketed the east.  Perhaps we have averted the return of militant pan-Arcadianism, or perhaps we have only hastened its renewal. For now, most Vinlanders are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.T;Une Crise de Foi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.D;“The annexation of Louisiane can be summarized as wrong, dangerous, and subversive of our institutions. It was wrong, because at no point had our nation or any of its predecessors claimed Louisiane. Even our forefathers in the days of the Revolution made no such claim. It was dangerous, because it has entangled the armed forces of all the States within policing actions and made us the eternal enemy of Plantagenia. It was subversive of our institutions, because its acquisition threatens to enshrine forever the Slave Power within Belgium. I can think of no better comparison than the flight of Icarus : the grandeur of our success more than outweighed by the ruinous consequences of our folly.” – Caroline Representative Daniel van Buren\n\nOur liberation of Louisiane has produced unforeseen consequences. Multiple states are now fearful of the confederal government’s power, while others worry that Louisane’s admission will permanently empower the Old Arcadians, many of whom are Southern slaveowners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.A;But, it was our destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.T;The Louisianais Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.D;“We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal, and endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…Having received innumerable proofs that there exist no stewards of our nation but ourselves, we reclaim the ancient freedoms of our forefathers and thus our honor.” – Declaration of Louisianais Independence\n\nThe free states of the Confederacy have completely withdrawn all military and financial resources from Louisiane in protest of its annexation. The slave states have tried to keep order, but the burden of administration has outstripped them. The chaos in Louisiane which has thus arisen has caused their nationalists to lose faith in our leadership. They have now taken measures into their own hands and declared independence, and partisans are running rampant in the region. The Armée Confédérée is holding on to what areas of Louisiane that it can but most of the south has already seceded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.A;How could this have happened!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.T;Sororicide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.D;The Seven Sisters are at each other’s throats. While at first it seemed that the only consequence of our defeat against the Plantagenians would be the loss of Vierset and certain punitive conditions imposed upon our military, the true repercussions have only now shown themselves. The failure of the Armée Confédérée has opened the floodgates of political discord. The Dutch League is declaring that its views were correct and that the whole war was a ruinous error : the Burgundian League is blaming the Old Arcadians for allowing their greed to drive the Confederacy to ruin : and the Old Arcadians are accusing the other two leagues, especially the Dutch, of stabbing the nation in the back. For the first time since the ratification of the Constitution, the flags of the individual republics are a more common sight than the confederal one. Protests are breaking out across the nation, and the word on the lips of many politicians – in private or even in public – is “secession”…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.A;Do not lose faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.T;The Vote of No Confidence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.D;The loss of Louisiane could not be readily explained in or to the States-General. No amount of adroit speechcraft by the Stadtholder or any of his political allies could satisfy the legislature’s outrage at the loss of the territory whose liberation was our reason for waging war against the Cadiens. It soon became apparent that they didn’t want mere answers – they wanted heads to roll. This morning a vote of no confidence was held, and the government lost. Snap elections have been called but the Stadtholder has already resigned in disgrace. Ominously, this has not brought an end to our instability. If anything, it has exacerbated it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.A;Losing the Stadtholder was bad, but at least things can’t get any worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.T;The Western Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.D;“There was an assumption of the equality of races entertained by leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution. It was a sandy foundation, as was the idea of a Government built upon it. When the ‘storm came and the wind blew, it fell.’ The foundations of our new government are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the fact that neither the negro nor the Indian are equal to the white man - that subordination to the superior race is inevitable. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this self-evident truth. The other republics have betrayed this truth and plunged daggers into our backs. We shall suffer their abuses no longer.” – Hôte Valoisy Grand Pensionary Jean Slechteman\n\nThe dream of Liberty and Union has been murdered by the Seven Sisters’ vendettas. This morning the Burgundians from Hôte Valoisy and Flandre Supéryeure withdrew to their home states, which have both declared secession. This is the beginning of a crisis, but the worst may be yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.A;Bella, horrida bella, Et Thybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.T;Declaration of a State of Emergency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.D;“Article 20 : In the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution, or if public security is clearly endangered, the Stadtholder may take measures necessary to restore law and order, intervening if need be with the aid of the armed forces. For this purpose, he may suspend for a while, in whole or in part, the rights provided in Articles 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. The Stadtholder must inform the States-General without delay of all measures taken in accordance with this Article. These measures are to be revoked on the demand of the States-General…” – The Belgian Constitution\n\nThe Old Arcadians have made their move. Our crisis has allowed them, with the support of their rich backers, to maneuver their candidate, shipping baron Gerhard Monfried, into the stadtholdership. He has promptly invoked Article 20. For all intents and purposes, Belgium is no longer a democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.A;It’s only temporary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.T;The Espérance Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.D;“Resolved, That, in light of the public danger posed to the aforesaid States, it is recommended to their Legislatures to pass laws authorizing the Grand Pensionaries or Commanders in Chief of their militia to make detachments from the same, or to form voluntary corps, as shall be most suitable to their Constitutions, and to cause the same to be well armed, equipped and disciplined, and held in readiness for service : and upon the request of the Grand Pensionary of either of the other States, to employ the whole of such units, as well as the regular forces of the State, in assisting the State, making such request to repel any invasion thereof which shall be made or attempted…” – The Espérance Declaration\n\nThe Dutch League was outraged by the Old Arcadians’ seizure of power. They may not have had the resources to stop it, but they were determined to resist. Now Caroline and Filipine, the Dutch heartland, have both declared their intent to defend themselves against the confederal government, effectively seceding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.T;The Tyranny of Duke Alexandre I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.D;“The republican order is crashing down. Never has such evidence been given of the weakness of democracy. This those in antiquity knew. Did Athens not crumble in the face of Macedon? Did Rome not take up the imperial laurel? We have inherited all the old flaws of republicanism. The only way to shed them is to cast off the whole shell. Like the phoenix we emerge from the ashes of death into the bloom of life : that we do so resting upon the ancient principles of rulership is natural.” – Duke Alexandre I of Base-Valoisy\n\nThroughout our struggles, one promise was held sacred : opposition to monarchical rule. That vow has now been blasphemed. Grand Pensionary Alexandre Saftleven of Base-Valoisy has crowned himself Duke of the region, and now rules the land as his private fief. §RThe remaining Belgians are now ready to make any sacrifice to obliterate this scourge from the earth. The Stadtholder’s reaction to this news spoke for us all.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.A;“I want Base-Valoisy BURNED TO THE GROUND!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.T;The Sacred War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.D;The vile traitors of Base-Valoisy foolishly believed that we would wallow in despair rather than deliver righteous vengeance upon them. Their profaning of the republican cause, however, has rendered their annihilation necessary. Now, we go forth to wipe the stain of Base-Valoisy from the face of the Earth. Forget any ridiculous prattle about the “Seven Sisters!” These disgusting vermin are no kin of ours. There is only one course of action which we must follow, without straying, without ceasing, until it is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.A;Tuez-les tous! Dieu reconnaîtra les siens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.T;Sic Semper Tyrannus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.D;It is done. Base-Valoisy has been righteously punished. Not since the harrowing of the Albigensians has such slaughter as we have unleashed upon Base-Valoisy been seen amongst the children of the Franks. Entire communities have been erased, burned ruins their only memorial. In town after town, loyalists of the hated traitor Alexandre Saftleven have been hung from the streetlamps, their homes sacked and torched, their names struck out of registries to destroy their very memories. The cathartic release of our long-suffering people, who have finally destroyed the deceivers in our midst, has been a great salve. The capture of the false Duke was best of all. Hauled back to Nouvelle Bruges, he was convicted of treason, hanged in front of the Stadtholder’s residence, and his body then preserved and shipped back to Base-Valoisy. From there, it was brought to the Plantagenian border and gibbeted in sight of a Cadien fort! Let that Judas Iscariot be a testament to the fate of despots in Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.A;Live free or die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.T;God Save the King of New Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.D;That was a brilliant plan, Your Majesty! Simply brilliant! Only you, my lord, could have known that the unwashed rabble of Nouvèl Flande and its ilk would’ve been so overcome with fury that they’d be blind to your stellar maneuvers! I mean, that encirclement which you pulled off at the border was a thing of beauty! And the way in which you directed the cavalry, cutting those ruffians down when they tried to flee – magnificent! Oh, I do wish we’d had more time to plan the coronation, but all things considered, I believe it went rather well, if I do say so myself, Your Majesty. Watching that dreadful Stadtholder hung, drawn, and quartered was certainly a clever way to cap off the festivities. But my lord – and I know how busy you are now, what with the royal court, and negotiations with all those corporate men – I just want to know, how did you know it all would work out? How did you know that the people needed not just a duke, but a king, and that they’d recognize you were the one to lead them – to lead us all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.A;We are simply that good, dear subject. Run along, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.T;Pacifying the “Pacifists”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.D;With Base-Valoisy crushed, we must now turn to the north. The loathsome Dutch League stabbed us in the back when they convinced not just one, but two republics to secede from us in our time of need! For decades, their cowardly “pacifists” have obstructed TRUE Belgian patriots from doing what must be done. Call us Old Arcadians, Brabantians, or Roosters, but we are and have always been the only people who see the one true future of Belgium. But that glorious day – that shining promise of a union unlike any ever before seen – is far off yet. Now, we shall continue paving the road towards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.A;And we shall pave it over the bones of Caroline and Filipine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.T;De Grote Zuivering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.D;The Grote Zuivering or “Great Purge” was a campaign of targeted killings against Carolinean and Filipinean nationalists, pacifists, and Calvinists by Belgian troops in $YEAR$. While it is difficult to pin down the start of the violence, most point to an order issued by General Antonin Snieckers to “root our partisan activity” in Binche. In towns across the north, notable Dutch Leaguers and their families were hunted down and massacred. The spectacular violence caused thousands of Carolinians and Filipineans to flee their homes, with most settling in Vinland. Several communities, notably Waterstad and Leuven, were almost totally depopulated. The carnage ended the Dutch League’s status as one of the two largest parties. Notoriously, the Belgian government denied that any violence had occurred. Even in modern times most Belgian historians either do not recognize the Grote Zuivering or downplay its severity. A quote from Nouvèl Loraine Grand Pensionary Émile van de Graaf sums up the views of most Brabantians on the matter at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.A;“Nothing has happened, but if something happened, then they deserved it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.T;Peace in Our Time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.D;“True Christian believers are sheep among wolves…Neither do they use worldly sword or war, since all killing has ceased with them.” – Conrad Grebel\n\nThe torch of liberty has driven out the darkness! While we, the Dutch Leaguers of Caroline and Filipine, took no pleasure in battling our southern kinsmen, we could not allow ourselves to be subsumed within the monstrosity which the Old Arcadians wrought. Now that the government is back in the hands of reason, a new constitutional convention has been called to remove the deficiencies from the present document. Article 20, which enabled the Brabantians and their corporate backers to wreak such havoc, must go. A new generation is arising, one which shall beat their swords into plowshares and build a more equal, equitable, and just Belgium. Perhaps the newest political party, founded by disaffected young members of the Dutch League and led by author Abraham Haafner, is the best sign of our political future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.A;Long live the Idealists! Long live the free Belgian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.T;The State of Emergency is Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.D;When the Old Arcadians, aided by certain men of means, used Article 20 of the Belgian Constitution to turn the Stadtholder into a dictator, they knew that such measures could not last. As soon as the States-General could reconvene and reach quorum, they passed a measure demanding an end to the state of emergency, as was their right according to Article 20. Rather than ignite a constitutional crisis so soon after the recent conflicts, the Old Arcadians decided to acquiesce. The state of emergency has come to an end, and democracy is reasserting itself. Despite the return of civil liberties, however, a precedent has been set which may be used to restore authoritarianism in the future. Nobody is more pleased at this prospect than the Old Arcadians…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.A;What matters is that we have prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.T;Nouvelle Bruges Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.D;Our efforts to blaze our own trail on the world stage may have come to an abrupt end. The central government in Nouvelle Bruges has defeated all challenges – and was tremendously brutal in doing so. Many within our own government are now fearful that such violence may be wrought upon our own people as punishment for “betraying” the easterners. It is foolish to think that they would understand the reasons why our actions were necessary. Perhaps we should simply petition for re-annexation, and spare our people the bloodshed which has already turned the south and the north crimson red?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.A;“Seven Sisters” and all that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG52.T;The Formation of the New Arcadian Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG52.D;“The events of the past few years have effectively abrogated all compromises in the political field. Slavery and the interests of the monied elite have advanced, while the interests of the common man and honest industry have shrunken to our collective detriment. Our is a simple platform : fair immigration, a common franchise, the breaking of the Trusts’ grip upon the government, and the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime, within Belgium. If our continent is to emerge into the future, it will only be under the light of liberty.” – Resolution of the New Arcadian Association (later the New Arcadian Party) of Nouvèl Flandre, $YEAR$\n\nThe inability of the Dutch League to restrain the Burgundians and the Old Arcadians has caused a new, radical generation of young liberals and dissatisfied veterans to break away. While espousing pan-Arcadian rhetoric, they also demand massive reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG52.A;Government of the people, by the people, for the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.T;The “Fourth League”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.D;The creation of the New Arcadian Party has destabilized Belgian politics. Ever since our independence from Plantagenia, the Burgundians and the Dutch held one another in check, with the Brabantians being further counterbalanced by the two. The emergence of a radical liberal party has shattered all of this. Not only are the New Arcadians advocating substantial political change as well as pan-Arcadianism, but they have also broken all the typical rules of Belgian political organization. They have eschewed respectable politics in favor of organizing street rallies and distributing political literature in communities across the nation. The fact that they do not trace their ancestry back to any cultural group is even more unsettling to the established parties. Some say that the Belgian political sphere is unravelling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.A;Surely this is a mere bump in the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.T;De Wylde Rytt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.D;The “Wylde Rytt” is a phrase which emerged around $YEAR$ to describe the political conditions in the Belgian Confederacy. Factors such as the emergence of new political parties, the slavery debate, increased urbanization, widening economic disparity, and growing immigration, all led to heightened public tension. The ten-year period of the Wylde Rytt saw multiple parties follow the New Arcadian example and adopt tactics of mass organization, while political machines sought to capture and manipulate the immigrant vote, causing their opponents to double down on anti-immigrant rhetoric. The decade also saw Belgian corporations, influential since the Hanse der Neuen Welt (HNW) moved from Lübeck to Arcadia and led to the creation of the New Burgundy Colony in the 17th century, rapidly gaining power. Above all was a growing feeling that the current Belgian constitution was insufficient and required amendment or even replacement. The result was a cavalcade of political struggle which often erupted into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.A;Hold on tight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.T;The Rise of Les Fiducies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.D;Ever since the Hanseatic League fled to New Burgundy to escape destruction at the hands of Scandinavia after the Imperial Wars of Religion (1605-1621), and the founding of the HNW in 1669, corporations have remained a pillar of Belgian society. The concept of the business trust is centuries old. One party conveys legal possession and title of certain property to a second party, a trustee. While that trustee has ownership, they cannot use the property, but holds it 'in trust' for the well-being of another. Thus a few people may control vast conglomerates. In the years after the Arcadian War, the trusts (or “Les Fiducies” to refer to them as a unit), began to amass unprecedented power. Often backing the Old Arcadian Party, they sought to reorganize Belgium into a centralized, militarized, expansionist state, and to develop a symbiotic relationship with the government. §RIf we allow Les Fiducies to gain too much influence, then they will turn our confederacy into a corporatocracy, with terrible consequences for liberty and justice.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.A;“And much of Madness, and more of Sin, And Horror the soul of the plot.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.T;Les Fiducies Aid Southern Reconstruction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.D;The end of the Arcadian War saw substantial damage across Sanacomie. Many slaveowners in the region, though possessing substantial capital, were more concerned with rebuilding and preserving their own plantations than restoring the region. Now a bill has come before the States-General to use assistance from Les Fiducies to rebuild Sanacomie. The bill’s provisions include subsidies for investments in the region, a generous contract system for infrastructure expansion, and the weakening of regulations involving the use of immigrant labor. While the Old Arcadians are the chief architects of the bill, the Burgundians are particularly intrigued by its provisions about providing grants for corporations to construct new settlements in Sanacomie, believing such a system could be replicated in the west. The Burgundians also envision using it to assist in settling the Great Lakes, a region that they have long coveted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.A;An excellent proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.B;There’ll be no carpetbagging in Sanacomie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.T;Les Fiducies Aid Western Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.D;As expected, the Burgundians have now rallied around using the support of Les Fiducies to bolster infrastructure in the west. The newest bill before the States-General is largely a replication of the terms of the previous one, except geared towards creating new constructions in Hôte Valoisy and Flandre Supéryeure rather than restoring old ones in Sanacomie. This bill, however, is focused on attracting new western settlers. It would substantially decrease harbor fees for shipping companies bringing immigrants, provide subsidies for prospective employers to hire immigrants overseas and bring them to work in Belgium, and award lucrative railroad contracts on a non-competitive basis to certain corporations. The fact that strengthened infrastructure and new settlements in the west would aid a future war to claim the lands of the Great Lakes has not gone unnoticed by the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.A;Another victory for private-public partnerships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.B;Sell immigrants into servitude like livestock? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.T;De Jonge Brigades;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.D;The abolition debate in Nouvèl Loraine has now grown ferocious. Many new immigrants, particularly those from Germany, are angry that substantial amounts of rural land continue to be bound up in vast slave plantations, causing something of a land crisis. Now some radicals are resorting to violent measures. The Jonge Brigades (“Young Brigades”) and other such groups are waging a partisan war against slavery. While some are merely freeing slaves, others are attacking plantations, arming the slaves, and driving out or killing the slaveowners, before burning their estates. In the aftermath, much of the land is being bought up by Les Fiducies, who are parceling it out and selling or renting it to freed slaves and immigrants. Others are exploring the newly “vacant” areas for minerals. While nothing can be proven – so far – these Jonge Brigades seem to have been organized and armed quite well in a short amount of time. It’s hard to afford the shiny new rifles they carry on a common wage…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.A;Any ally in the war on slavery is appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.B;PRIVATE MILITIAS attacking OUR citizens? The army will end this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.T;The Great Maline Dock Strike of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.D;Like most of Nouvèl Flande, the city of Maline grew tremendously during the 19th century. It prospered as a manufacturing hub due to its proximity to iron mines in Flandre Supéryeure and Nouvèl Loraine. However, the growing immigrant population in Maline was the victim of severe prejudice, with most labor organizations refusing them membership. The growth of Blanquist thought amongst Maline unions, however, promoted the idea of class solidarity. This led to the Great Maline Dock Strike of $YEAR$, launched in protest of dangerous working conditions, by workers of various nationalities and religions. The unprecedented unity displayed by the strikers unnerved employers – yet a solution presented itself. The Roosevelt Detective Agency had been formed several years prior, and often aided Les Fiducies by violently attacking unions. It was proposed to the Stadholder at the time, Johan Thiers, to use the Roosevelts to break the strike. As everyone knows…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.A;The Maline strikebreaking was where the Roosevelts became famous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.B;Thiers refused and the Armée Confédérée crushed the strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.T;The Second Belgian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.D;Historians point to many factors in explaining the events of $YEAR$ : economic upheaval, the debate on slavery or the Constitution, nativism, the growth of new parties, or even the emergence of millenarian religious movements. What is not disputed is that by this time Les Fiducies had not merely gained power over the government – they WERE the government, needing only someone to put forward as their champion. Now, a charismatic veteran named Leopold Salan has led a group of armed Old Arcadians to seize L'hôtel Phrygien in Nouvelle Bruges and proclaim himself Stadtholder! When the army was sent to capture them, Salan gave a spellbinding balcony speech which won them over, soon joined by many supporters, jubilant at the end of weak rule. More than a few streets ran red with the blood of Salan’s enemies, but soon the States-General was taken, and the Stadtholder’s palace claimed. Now our nation will have true, strong, invincible leadership! The leadership of Stadtholder Salan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.A;And the rule of Les Fiducies behind him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.T;Emancipation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.D;It has been many years since our independence, but our nation is not yet free. Not only do we possess myriad external foes – Plantagenia and Vinland especially – but there is no shortage of traitors within our midst. The legions of un-Belgian villains are endless : Blanquists, Jesuits, Freemasons, Hebrews, Negroes, Indians…Thankfully, Stadtholder Salan knows them well. He has seen fit to pass the Emancipation from Public Enemies Act, which shall free us from these menaces forever! The first half of the act created the Gendarmerie Nationale, the first fully national military police force. The original constitutional drafters may have been too cowardly to establish such a group, but we know now that it is necessary. The second half awards them, and the newly created Ministry of Supervision, broad authority to defend our freedom. Already they are sweeping the nation, rooting out any unpatriotic menaces! Soon we shall purge the rot from our national body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.A;Les Fiducies may grow during the chaos but it is a mere coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.T;The Proclamation of the Septiman Directorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.D;“When some man arises with a nature of sufficient force, he shakes off all that we have taught him, bursts his bonds, and breaks free : he tramples underfoot our codes and juggleries, our charms and ‘laws,’ which are all against nature : our servant rises in revolt and shows himself our master, and there dawns the full light of natural justice.” – Plato\n\nThe Belgian Confederacy was rotten to its core. The only solution was to start over from scratch. This morning Leopold Salan gathered his supporters at his residence in Nouvelle Bruges. From his podium he declared the end of the Belgian Confederacy. In its place he raised up a new nation, one built on everlasting might! He declared himself Directeur of the Septiman Directorate, as is his right as a great man of destiny! The time has come, he declared, to bring order to Arcadia – OUR order, the order of superior Septimania! With Les Fiducies at his back and the Septiman people following his banner, we shall march to victory over all enemies of our holy nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.A;§RManifest Destiny shall heal our wounds and sorrow.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG630.T;Je Nieuweu Cursus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
NBG630.D;Years following the Declaration of Nouvelle Bruges by the Groot-Regisseur Leopold Salan himself, the political climate in Septimania has started to gradually feel the gradual heatwave of Blanqui’s socialism coming from Europe. This has started to upset the foundations of the Directorate and made wary a lot of statesmen due to the potential and future ramifications it may bring to our rule. However, pro-Salanist students hailing from the University of Nouvelle Bruges focusing on the humanities and economics have put forth the idea of formulating a “New Course” as a reaction to this threat. Applying the ideas of Paternalism, this “new course” aims to further develop the interests of Salanism to the age of industrialization: the promotion of ‘corporatism’ to promote the interests of industrialists and capitalists with the state’s guidance, the simultaneous development of industrial and military capacity (Gelijktijdigéité), the encouragement of token social reforms to workers and citizens alike, a new and rigorous “police state”, and an “aggressive” and “military first” approach to Arcadianism (Havikisme). With the next Grand Council Convention taking place in a couple of days, it is no denying that they shall prioritize this mere piece of paper from overachieving students into a major guiding force in their national policy for the coming years, if not decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG630.A;An eerie foreshadowing of what is to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.T;The Third Belgian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.D;The Third Belgian Revolution is also known as the “Bread and Roses Revolution” after a popular protest slogan and song, “Bread” symbolizing both an end to food shortages and restoration of basic freedoms, and “Roses” symbolizing democracy and expansion of workers’ and minority rights. It started in Filipine, when thousands of female garment workers in Leuven went on strike to protest unfair working conditions. The Gendarmerie Nacionale’s attack on the strikers ignited citywide fighting. Word of the strike spread and workers in Phillipia went on strike as well. Protests soon swept the nation. The decisive moment came when soldiers in Nouvelle Bruges were ordered to fire on a crowd of protestors, only to instead join them. The crowd stormed government and corporate offices across the capital, before capturing the Directeur. He and the heads of Les Fiducies were tried and executed in a highly publicized trial to unveil the horrific crimes of the regime. The new government has devoted itself to defending the people without violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.A;Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.T;The New Colossus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.D;Our nation has been transformed since the first Directeur bravely took power. The Gendarmerie are a common sight in the streets, while the Ministry of Supervision have detailed records of all citizens. Walled “Sequestrations” keep each unruly minority within its own community. Education covers vital topics like basic military training, racial science, and herology, the study of great men and women in history. The destruction of treasonous faiths like Catholicism and Anabaptism has led to the emergence of more vibrant, esoteric, militant sects better suited to our new society. All the while, the great Fiducies keep our honorable people supplied with excellent new products, especially the cocaine-infused cigarettes and candies so valued by frontline units (and the sodas for all ages). The indenture system provides them with all the labor they could ever want. All political groups have aligned towards our Manifest Destiny, greatly aiding national stability and efficiency. Our is a proud, pious, superior civilization – the pinnacle race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.A;§RIn God we trust.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.T;The Crescendo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.D;Belgian political instability has reached extreme levels. Political clubs of all ideologies are mobilizing their supporters in the streets, and many have begun to carry weapons. While in some cities, these clubs simply hold marches and rallies, in others they are attacking each other and the police. Immigrant groups, in turn, are turning to ethnic street gangs for protection. All the while, the authority of the confederal and state governments continues to conflict, and Les Fiducies seek further opportunities to consolidate power. A solution may now be in sight. For years, activists have been pressuring state legislatures to adopt measures calling upon the States-General to call another constitutional convention, to address unresolved problems with the current constitution, as is their right under Article 6. This morning Hôte-Valoisy passed such a measure, being the last state to do so. The States-General have now declared that the Eleventh Constitutional Convention shall be held in Nouvelle Bruges in two weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.A;God willing, it will be the last…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.T;The Opening of the Eleventh Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.D;The original Belgian Constitution had been hammered out with the Sanacomie issue looming over the delegates’ heads. For this reason, there were many aspects of it which did not receive proper attention. It is hoped that this convention will be different, and that the document it produces will stand the test of time. The first major issue to arise was that of centralization. Both Old and New Arcadians are skeptical of centralization, for different reasons, but others believe it has proved unworkable. Centralizers are in turn divided as to whether the confederal government should merely assume further powers (the Dutch view) or if the individual republics’ governments should be dissolved and the nation fully centralized (the Burgundian view). §BWhichever group prevails in this convention will enshrine their values as the bedrock of Belgium.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.A;No centralization! We shall not sacrifice liberty for security!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.B;The confederal government needs more rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.C;A unitary system is what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.T;Isolationists Demand Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.D;The Dutch League has begun to modify its pacifist stance as of late. Whereas the party once hewed closely to notions of Calvinist and Anabaptist morality, they have now shifted towards more secular and economic-focused ideas of domestic reform and internal improvements. For this reason, they have threatened to stage a walkout from the convention unless further measures to empower the central government are made. The Burgundians have accused the Dutch of hypocrisy, seeking to use centralization to strike at slavery while opposing further economic contributions into the national budget from the rich Northern states which most of them hail from. §RWhile allowing the “Lions” to leave would make it far easier to reform government finances, it would also remove one of the two parties most fiercely opposed to Les Fiducies.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.A;Call their bluff, they wouldn’t dare leave themselves out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.B;Some measures of centralization could be adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.T;Old Arcadians Protest Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.D;The Old Arcadians have come out in opposition of plans to transfer powers from the individual republics to the central government. They argue that doing so goes against the Belgian national spirit of freedom and liberty, that such measures would make Arcadian unification less attractive to other nations, and that the issues facing Belgium could be resolved through smaller federal reforms, rather than imposing a unitary system. For these reasons they have threatened to stage a walkout from the convention unless the proposed new Constitution shifts from a unitary to a federal model. Their critics accuse them of attempting to thwart abolition – many Old Arcadians are Southern slaveowners. The situation is complicated further by the fact that the Old Arcadians’ votes would be necessary to reform the national budget from one based on “donations” to standardized revenues. §RAllowing them to leave could doom fiscal reform and thus the ability to build any sort of greater Arcadian state.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.A;Good riddance! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.B;Some measures of federalization could be adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.T;The Battle of Rue de Darlan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.D;The original Old Arcadian Club, located in Nouvelle Bruges on the Rue de Darlan, has long held quasi-religious significance for pan-Arcadianists. The Club has also become a meeting place for anti-abolitionists. This morning an argument between some Old Arcadian slaveowning delegates and Dutch-aligned abolitionists outside of the Club evolved into a street brawl. Both sides called upon armed supporters, with Jonge Brigade veterans aiding the Dutch and various street gangs aiding the Old Arcadians. In the confusion, the club caught fire (a popular but disproved myth states that a black abolitionist threw dynamite into the Club), and the brawl only ended when firefighters arrived to contain the blaze. No deaths occurred, but the Club was destroyed, and many Southern delegates have alleged the incident was a Dutch plot and have demanded their expulsion, while the Dutch have argued the inverse. §RExpelling the Lions would strengthen the cause of slavery and Les Fiducies while expelling the Roosters could doom fiscal reform.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.A;All Dutch deputies involved must be arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.B;Expel the Brabantians! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.C;This was a tragedy, but we must move forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.T;The Lions Abandon the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.D;Following through on their threat, the isolationists of the Dutch League have departed from the constitutional convention. It seems that our opposition to any form of centralization was unacceptable to them, who accused the Old Arcadians and the Burgundians of “crucifying the nation upon the cross of slavery.” One the one hand, this will make fiscal reform far easier to secure. The northerners of the Lions were some of the strongest opponents to more formal government revenue measures – most southerners allege this was due to not wanting to pay for the slave states’ needs. On the other hand, the Lions were some of the strongest opponents of Les Fiducies. The Dutch League’s self-imposed temporary removal from the political sphere could grant them an opportunity…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.A;Just more bitter politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.T;The Arcadians Abandon the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.D;Following through on their threat, the pan-Arcadians of the Brabantian League have departed from the constitutional convention. It seems that our commitment to centralization was unacceptable to them, who accused the Dutch and the Burgundians of “snuffing out the light of liberty for the sake of bureaucracy.” On the one hand, this has all but removed any threat of Les Fiducies maneuvering a dictator into power and will surely doom the institution of slavery in Belgium. On the other, the Old Arcadians’ votes were critical in breaking the deadlock on fiscal reform and ending the current system of “donations” set by each republic. While no republic has ever refused to contribute revenue to the confederal budget, it seems this topic will not be addressed – and it is almost unthinkable to imagine a unified Arcadia operating under such a system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.A;Just more bitter politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.T;The Convention Deadlocks on Fiscal Reform!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.D;The topic of reforming Belgian government finances has caused the convention to grind to a halt. At present, the budget of the Belgian Confederation consists of “donations” from each republic, the amount of which is set by each republic’s own laws. There has not been any case of a republic refusing to contribute money to the confederate budget, but that could change at any time. If we ever want to unite Arcadia under our banner, then we must establish a formal government revenue system. So far, however, a cross-party opposition bloc has prevented such measures. The northerners in the Dutch League don’t want their money going to southern slave states, and the southerners in the Burgundian League don’t want to pay for northern abolitionists. Delegates’ patience is wearing thin, and the matter will soon be brought to a vote for the final time. If we don’t want pan-Arcadianism to die for the sake of petty fiscal politics, then we must offer concessions to the Arcadians and their corporate backers to secure their votes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.A;Offer concessions to the Roosters and Les Fiducies to bring them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.B;The “Nons” have it! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.T;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.D;With the Old and the New Arcadians dominating the conference, the last great political battle has emerged : the question of slavery. At this point, anti-slavery sentiment has spread throughout Belgium to the point that defending slavery as a permanent institution is unthinkable for any but the most reactionary politician. However, many corporations have begun to experiment with integrating slaves, either Afro-Franks or rented convicts, into their business models. While many recognize that slavery is a doomed institution in the long run, conservatives have argued that immediate abolition would create even more chaos, not to mention doubting that the confederal government can end slavery where it already exists. They have instead proposed that a deadline be set for all republics to abolish slavery within ninety-nine years. New Arcadians are horrified at this idea, but moderates see it as a way for slavery to “inevitably perish” without upending society. §RLes Fiducies may take action to defend slavery if they are strong enough.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.A;Through bribery, blackmail, and intimidation…ninety-nine years it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.B;EIGHT years, and not one hour, one minute, one second more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.T;The Emergency Powers Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.D;With the Burgundians and the Dutch Leagues dominating the conference, the last great political battle has emerged : the question of emergency powers. Article 20 of the current Belgian constitution allows for a state of emergency to be proclaimed by the Stadtholder “in the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution, or if public security is clearly endangered.” The unilateral domestic powers given to the Stadtholder in this scenario effectively enables them to become a temporary dictator. While the States-General is in theory able to end the state of emergency at any time, many liberals see the article as too dangerous. The Burgundians have defended the measure as a precaution against insurrection. The Dutch League demands the measure’s abolition, but they recognize the danger of secession. Therefore, their solution is nothing less than a fully unitary government! While a radical view, it would remove most abilities of the states to resist Nouvelle Bruges, for better or for worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.A;We will not abandon the traditions of our forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.B;Time for some truly arcane maneuvering…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.T;The Rooster State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the Old Arcadians have triumphed. Their vision of a decentralized, traditionalist nation carried the day, as did their aspirations of continental unity. It is their hope that this is merely another step towards the final consolidation of Arcadia under Belgian leadership. While it is true that the confederal government may have concerning limits placed upon its power compared to the republics, the Brabantians are confident that the republics will safeguard our liberty. That they will do so in a land of master and slave is, for now, irrelevant. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation look towards the future with the anticipation of those who know that true greatness is still yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.A;It’s morning again in Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.T;A New Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the New Arcadians have triumphed. Their vision of a federalized, progressive nation carried the day, as did their aspirations of continental unity. At long last, the old party system has been shattered, and a new generation of radical liberals are rising to the fore! Scorning the Old Arcadians’ notions that unity could only come to Arcadia through stolid reaction and the power of the wealthy elite, they seek to build an equal, equitable, and just nation, for all people. The upcoming abolition of slavery has further energized the egalitarian spirit which is now being reborn amongst our people. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation find a new sense of hope and aspiration stirring within them, animating them to strive for a glorious future which transcends our petty divisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.A;Yes, we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.T;Past and Future United;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the Burgundians have triumphed. Their vision of a centralized, conservative nation carried the day, placing the concerns of the Belgian nation over high-minded notions of continental unification. A new era of Belgian nationalism is dawning, one which is driving our people to unite around our commonalities and work for the collective betterment of our communities and our country. The republics and the confederal government, rather than force one side to sacrifice its interests, have reached a state of symbiotic equilibrium. Some mourn the loss of Belgium’s role as a candidate to lead the continent, but the Burgundians argue that leadership is perfectly possible without compromising who and what we are. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation are reassured at the notion that the future shall remain familiar, yet also be filled with wonderful possibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.A;We stand today on the edge of a new frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.T;The Self-Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.D;There was simply too much opposition from various localists to enshrine a truly unitary system. Thus, in a moment of supreme irony, the Dutch League turned to Article 20. During a lull in debate, the Stadtholder and the Dutch leaders slipped out. They raced to the Stadtholder’s residence, where the Stadtholder – armed with evidence of bribery and sabotage of crucial legislation by state legislatures, their (non-Dutch) officials, and corporate backers, which the League had intended to present before the convention was called – signed two acts. The first was to declare a state of emergency. The second was to declare the Dutch draft of the constitution adopted. Upon hearing of this, convention delegates suspended debate and decamped to the States-General to demand an end to the (now illegal) dictatorship, but government pamphlets with the incriminating evidence were being distributed around the city. The “four-hour dictatorship” has ushered in a radical new era, and the delegates and the nation embrace the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.A;Our long national nightmare is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.T;The Formation of the National Corporate Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.D;The growing influence of Les Fiducies threatens to overwhelm the government. In order to avert a coup, the Old Arcadian League has devised a measure to redirect their aspirations for power into a more legitimate institution. The National Corporate Council has been created to act as an official intermediary between the nation’s major corporations and the government. Chaired by representatives of the nine largest corporations in Belgium, the NCC will advise the Stadtholder and the States-General on drafting legislation and provide an official forum for corporations to lobby the government. Though the NCC’s creation has been severely criticized for opening the door to oligarchy, the Brabantians have countered that, on the contrary, it eliminates the danger of corporations seeking to assault Belgian democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.A;The business of the Belgian government is business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG81.T;The Business Plot and the Ste. Claire Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG81.D;Last week a veteran named Leopold Salan led some followers in an attempt to seize a hotel in Nouvelle Bruges. Police stopped him but Salan’s cryptic statements while in custody led detectives to his home in Port Valois. What they discovered was nothing less than evidence of a conspiracy by Old Arcadians and Les Fiducies to overthrow the government and establish a dictatorship! A committee led by famous reformer Leon Ste. Claire is now holding hearings in which the Old Arcadians and business leaders are devouring each other, naming names, and listing off all manner of depravities. Corruption, secret investments in plantations, arming Jonge Brigades, street gangs used as strikebreakers…The national outrage has allowed Ste. Claire to lead a bill bearing his name through the States-General. Not only does it immediately abolish forced labor (even as punishment for a crime), but major corporations have been nationalized. As waves of arrests are carried out nationwide, Les Fiducies lie dead at the feet of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN1.T;The Sioux Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN1.D;The fertile plains of central Arcadia have long been inhabited by various native tribes, with the Sioux being some of the most famous. The distance of these places from the power centers of the various Arcadian states has long prevented any of them from taking control of the region. Decades ago, in the aftermath of the war with Plantagenia, a commission was set up to delineate the frontier between Scandinavian Arcadia and Plantagenia. This was accomplished but the claims have long been merely theoretical. However, Plantagenian settlers continue to approach the area, far faster than we will be able to establish settlements there. If we cannot come to an agreement soon then we may lose control of the region entirely. Thus, we are going to arrange a diplomatic meeting with Plantagenia to decide upon the border. While we hope that Plantagenia will see reason and recognize our rightful claim to the Sioux lands it is probable that we will have to compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN1.A;But hopefully we will not have to compromise too much…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.T;The Sioux Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.D;The fertile plains of central Arcadia have long been inhabited by various native tribes, with the Sioux being some of the most famous. Various colonial powers such as Scandinavia and the Dual Monarchy made conflicting claims to the region, and we have inherited this problem. As settlers continue to flow northwards from Oumessourita towards the Sioux lands, we have come into conflict with Scandinavia, who has protested due to the decades-old preliminary border agreement in the region. Now they have come seeking a firmer revision, trying to lay claim to most of the Sioux lands. We should be considerate about how we respond. Some have suggested that we counter by demanding the southern part of their Indian protectorate but we could simply refuse to accept any Scandinavian claims in the region at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.A;Make the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.B;We will not compromise with European imperialists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.T;Plantagenia Makes a Counterproposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.D;The Cadiens were not pleased by our assertion of our claim to the Sioux lands, but they have not rejected it outright. Rather, they have set forth a condition for recognizing it : receiving the southwestern portion of the Skræling Territory. This region has seen considerable activity by Plantagenian Jesuit missionaries, and many tribes have converted to Catholicism – many, but not all, and it would be untrue to say that any native sees themselves as a Plantagenian. We might be able to convince them to reduce their demands by offering them half of their desired territory, which would still be a considerable gain for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.A;This is a steep price but still a reasonable one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.B;Try to bargain them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.T;The Illimark Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.D;The Scandinavians decided to be unexpectedly reasonable, and allowed us to receive southern Illimark from their Indian protectorate in exchange for recognizing their Sioux claims. We had expected its integration to be straightforward, given the prior work of Jesuit missionaries in the region. This has not been the case. The native peoples possess surprisingly dense communities which will not be easy to…shift, to clear the way for settlers. Furthermore, while some of them are Catholics, a considerable number are not, and these Indians have initiated considerable resistance against the expansion of our administration into the area. We are already having to reassign units from the Belgian border to keep the area pacified. §RThis overextension may have consequences if we go to war with the Belgians.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.A;I’m sure that it won’t be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.T;Scandinavia Makes a Counterproposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.D;The Scandinavians were willing to entertain our demands for part of Illimark in exchange for recognizing their Sioux claims, but resisted the idea of splitting the whole region with us. They have instead proposed that we merely annex the southern section of our desired territories from their Indian protectorate. While more bellicose ministers do not want us to back down, accepting this offer would allow us to acquire the most easily integrable part of the Indian lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.B;Half of half of Illimark is no deal at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.T;Plantagenia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.D;We have come to an agreement with the Cadiens regarding the Sioux lands. Though we have had to sacrifice part of the Skræling Confederacy in order to do it, hopefully these new western lands will prove worth the trade in the long run. We have heard rumors of the Plantagenians planning to enslave the non-Catholic Indians in their new lands, but hopefully these are just rumors…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.A;We shall rule the Sioux wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.T;A Lost Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.D;Our efforts to come to an agreement with Plantagenia regarding the Sioux lands have failed. Neither side was able to present a proposal which satisfied the other. It seems that the only thing which will determine the central Arcadia border is whichever nations’ settlers arrive there first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.A;The Sioux are now at Plantagenia’s mercy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN8.T;The Nova Lisboa Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN8.D;News has arrived from the Viceroyalty of New Spain of an attack on a northern frontier town by Apache natives. The Apaches are a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe which inhabit the region known to Spaniards as Apacheria and the Plantagenians as Cymrie. Their mastery of mounted warfare has enabled them to carve out a vast swath of territory for themselves in the wild lands of southern Central Arcadia. Now an Apache raiding party has assaulted the town of Nova Lisboa, located in northern Lusitania. Many of the town’s horses were stolen by the raiders, with other goods taken as well, and more than a few residents died defending their community. The attack has caused many colonial officials in the Viceroyalty of New Spain to push for us to bring order to Apacheria by annexing it. The main risk in doing so is inviting challenge from the Cadiens over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN8.A;One way or another we must end the Apache threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN9.T;The Nova Lisboa Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN9.D;News has arrived from Lusitania of an attack on a northern frontier town by Apache natives. The Apaches are a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe which inhabit the region known to Colombians as Apacheria and the Plantagenians as Cymrie.

Now an Apache raiding party has assaulted the town of Nova Lisboa, located in northern Lusitania.

ARCGEN10.A;One way or another we must end the Apache threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN11.T;The Cymrie Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN11.D;The region of Cymrie is inhabited by the Apaches, a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe whose mastery of mounted warfare has enabled them to carve out a vast swath of territory for themselves in the wild lands of southern Central Arcadia. The region was claimed by both the Dual Monarchy and Spain and now we have inherited this point of contention. It seems that a recent Apache attack on northern Lusitania has driven $FROMCOUNTRY$ to launch a substantial military expedition to crush the so-called “Empire of the Plains” once and for all. We are rapidly mobilizing our own expedition to attempt to steal a march on them, but it will be difficult. §BIf we have allocated resources to keeping the western border supplied, then we should be able to launch our own attack to intercept them and force them to recognize our own claim. However if we have not done so then they will likely succeed in dealing enough damage to the Apaches to secure at least theoretical control over Cymrie.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN11.A;Saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.T;Cymrie is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.D;With swift notice and plenty of cavalry at their disposal, our western garrisons were able to marshal a flying column to head west and intercept the Hispanic settlers and their military guards. After a tense standoff, the Hispanics turned back, effectively surrendering all their claims to Cymrie. While our sovereignty over the region is no longer contested by our southern neighbors, we still must break the Apaches and bring our enlightened rule to the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.A;The danger has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.T;Cymrie is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.D;Our western garrisons struggled to bring together enough spare men and resources to be able to launch an expedition. By the time that they finally set out and reached central Cymrie, they found the Hispanic settlers already well-established, with a military guard protecting their nascent towns. Rather than provoke an all-out war, our forces had to withdraw. Worst of all, the expedition suffered a disease outbreak on its return home, and more than a few men died without even seeing combat. The whole affair has been shameful, and we have lost any ability to claim Cymrie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.A;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.T;Apacheria is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.D;The Plantagenians had been keeping a close eye on the west for years, and they already had their forces in position to make a move when news reached them of our own expedition. They rapidly dispatched a flying column of cavalry ahead of a hastily organized initial group of settlers, seeking to head off our own forces. By the time that our men reached central Apacheria, the Cadiens had already set up rudimentary defenses in the region and greeted our convoy under arms. Rather than risk provoking an all-out war, we were forced to withdraw. Plantagenia is now in firm control of Apacheria, and our only consolation is that they are rumored to be quite ignorant of the true danger posed by the brutal Apaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.A;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.T;Apacheria is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.D;Our forces were able to enter Apacheria without much resistance, encountering no sign of any Plantagenians. After resupplying several settler communities and heading further towards the interior, they finally came face to face with a Plantagenian military expedition. However, our superior numbers and prepared defenses convinced the Cadiens that it was not worth fighting us, and they withdrew after a tense standoff. This means that Plantagenia has effectively surrendered all their claims to Apacheria. While our sovereignty over the region is no longer contested by the Cadiens, we still must break the Apaches and bring our enlightened rule to Central Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.A;The danger has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.T;The Apache Moon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.D;“As I was preparing for bed, I turned to the window to take one last look at the full moon, and beheld it like a floating pearl. Suddenly, a hellish cry shook me from my reverie. I thought it was a coyote until it was joined by many more. In an instant they were upon the town, a whole host of Apache braves. Some had not even a shirt, but all were armed and rode their horses with the ease of veterans. All able-bodied men grabbed our guns and leapt to the town’s defense. In a brutal exchange, no more than five minutes, it was accomplished, but they made off with a great bounty, including many horses. One month later, like clockwork, the full moon rose again, and brought the Apaches back with it…”\n\nOur frontier settlements in the land of the Apaches are under siege. Any settler traveling a significant distance must travel in a group or risk being taken by vengeful Indians. Whole towns are facing night raids, worst of all being the dreaded “Apache Moon,” when veritable armies of natives sweep across the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.A;Damn those Indians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.T;The End of the Apache Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.D;Several years ago, new inventions made tanning buffalo hides far easier and thus more profitable, leading to its near-eradication by commercial hunters from $COUNTRY$. This created an existential crisis among the Apache, who resolved to fight the hunter-settlers and the military patrols backing them. A series of attacks against settler outposts by the Apaches caused $COUNTRY$ to dispatch over a thousand troops to seize the Apaches’ safe havens and force them to abandon nomadism. The Apaches tried to string the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers along on an endless chase across the region. However, the ruthless scorched-earth policies of $COUNTRY$ soon caused the Apaches to run low on food and horses. The Battle of the Stockaded Plains saw the Apaches under their leader Cochise finally stand their ground and attempt to destroy their pursuers by catching them at dawn. While $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces sustained several casualties, the Apaches lost the battle and thus the war. By the end of $YEAR$, the “Apache Empire” was ashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.A;The Apache Moon shall rise no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.T;A Meeting of the National Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.D;The National Council of the Skræling Territories was formed to allow all of the major tribes within our lands to have representation, but it is widely criticized. Presided over by a Scandinavian representative, the Council’s actual legislative abilities are few. Moreover, the process by which tribes are allotted representatives is frequently revised by Copenhagen, and several tribes which are large enough to merit increased representation simply are left out for political reasons. Worst of all, the Iroquois continue to be overrepresented within the Council, reflecting their status as the Scandinavian’s primary collaborator. All of this means that the Council often struggles to even make it through its day-to-day business, let alone address crises. The worst part is that it is one of the most democratic and native-supporting systems in Euro-Arcadian society – the bar is just that low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.A;This is not the best way to run a nation…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.T;The Jesuits of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.D;Ever since the Dual Monarchy pushed its colonial boundaries into the Arcadian hinterland in the 17th century, Catholic missionaries have been a recurring sight across the Misizipi and Ohio river valleys. Now Plantagenia has sent the Society of Jesus, or simply the Jesuits, to assist us in educating our people. The Jesuits are known for integrating into a target community to better evangelize them, seeking both to convert non-Christians and bring non-Catholics into the Roman fold. This, along with their insular nature, leads many to heap accusations of conspiracy against them. Though most of these are too wild to take seriously, a concerning number of southern Illimarkers have accepted Catholicism, much to the dismay of Scandinavian Protestant missionaries. §RWhile they are strengthening our literacy they might also lead to cultural divergence and even separatism amongst the southerners.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.A;Any education assistance is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.B;Impose strict surveillance and force out any charismatic priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN20.T;The Jesuit Encroachment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This, along with their insular nature, leads many to heap accusations of conspiracy against them. Due to Plantagenia’s annexation of southern Illimark, we have little ability to resist this development, and conflicts between Catholic converts and older Protestant communities are already emerging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN20.A;At least they are building up our literacy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN21.T;The Kattefolket Sikariere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN21.D;Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths, but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies. A new religious movement amonge the Kattefolket of the southeast may change this. The believers have been called the “Sikariere,” after the Jewish religious militants of ancient times who sought to drive the Romans from their lands. Their leader, Tarhe (also known as “The Great Crane”), fancies himself a religious prophet. Inspired by a series of visions which he claims to have received last year, he has begun preaching a strange faith which blends elements of Protestant Christianity with beliefs from many different Iroquoian tribes. The main tenets of “Sikarierism” are temperance, community solidarity, and rejection of European culture. He has begun to attract quite a following, much to the alarm of the Europeans amongst us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN22.D;The fur trade has always been a cornerstone of the native Arcadian economy. The arrival of the Europeans, however, turned it into a massive enterprise which drove unprecedented levels of conflict amongst the tribes to supply the lucrative European market. The Iroquois became particularly known for their bellicose attitude towards their rivals in the fur trade. However, the trade has suffered from overhunting, as well as the growth of other fur sources in Hokkaigan, Qingqiu, Siberia, and eastern Europe. A group of Iroquois tribes are now planning to press the Scandinavian authorities to recognize them as the official representatives of fur traders within the Territory. They cite not only their tribe’s long history as the preeminent fur traders in the region, but the efficiency of routing the trade through only one group. While this would be highly lucrative, it would also outrage the Vinlandic traders, not to mention all of the non-Iroquois tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.A;The Iroquois succeed in becoming fur trade hegemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.B;The Vinlandic colonial government blocks the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.T;“On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.D;A recent book has brought the culture of the Kanien'kéha (Mohawk) people to Belgian attention. Henrik Costeau’s “On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government” is the result of three years of research, with Costeau having traveled throughout the northeastern Skræling Territory to compile his information. The work is a shameless courting of public scandal and infamy, with Costeau making many exaggerations and distortions of Kanien'kéha culture in the name of luridness (particularly his illustrations of Kanien'kéha women). The worst part of it all is that, even with such unprofessional presentation, the work still represents an expansion of Euro-Arcadian knowledge of the Kanien'kéha and of the Skræling Territory in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.A;And they think that WE are the ignorant savages?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.T;“On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.D;A recent book has brought the culture of the Mohawk Indians of the west to Belgian attention. Henrik Costeau’s “On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government” is the result of three years of research, with Costeau having traveled throughout the northeastern Skræling Territory to compile his information. The work has proven somewhat scandalous, as Costeau goes into rather lurid detail about the customs of the Mohawk and his time amongst them, with accompanying illustrations. The tone of the work is also far from academic, with a sardonic tone that sensationalizes elements of “primitive” Mohawk culture. Costeau’s use of controversial sciences such as phrenology in discussing the Mohawk have drawn criticism as well. The work’s defenders argue that the book is still an improvement over prior Mohawk scholarship, and has revealed that the Skræling are far more complicated than anyone suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.A;The pictures of the women seem particularly popular…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.T;The Legacy of Emil Krag;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.D;Emil Krag was a half-Cree, half-Vinlandic author and political activist who led the Revolution of 1827 against the Vinlandic colonial government and its Scandinavian overlords. While unsuccessful, he has become a martyr both for liberals and for native Arcadians. Krag is seen by some as the manifestation of the liberal ideal, someone who walked in both the European and the native Arcadian cultural worlds without totally immersing himself within either. Though reactionary native peoples see Krag as a Vinlandic figure without relevance to the Great Lakes, younger men of many tribes look up to Krag as an inspirational, revolutionary figure to be emulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.A;He is our hero, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.D;The reports from the north are clear : the Crown Colony of Vinland has ceased to exist. In its place a new and independent Vinlandic state has arisen, and Scandinavia’s influence in Arcadia has evaporated. Unfortunately, our “nation” was largely a Scandinavian construction, and our government and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped. Now, many tribes are agitating for independence, and the entire Great Lakes region risks dissolving into factionalism and separatism. With swift and decisive action from the government (such as it is), we might be able to hold things together, at least for the short term. But how should we couch our rhetoric to keep the nation together? Should we focus on dissuading radicalism and awaiting further developments, or seeking to rally the people behind a bold new future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.A;We must keep calm and act with caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.B;The hour of our freedom is at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.T;Vinlandic Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.D;For centuries, Vinland has been Scandinavia’s main route to exert influence amongst us. Thus it was with shock that our citizens awoke this morning to realize that we are now officially estranged from both Scandinavia and Vinland. Unfortunately, our “nation” was largely a Scandinavian construction, and our government and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped. Now, many tribes are agitating for independence, and the entire Great Lakes region risks dissolving into factionalism and separatism. This cannot be allowed! At long last, we finally have the freedom to forge our own destiny. We shall rally the people behind a bold new future and achieve unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.A;Good riddance to all colonizers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.T;The Skræling Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.D;The end of the Sanacomie War threatens to drive both the Belgian Confederacy and Plantagenia to turn towards the Skræling lands, now that they are no longer preoccupied with fighting one another. The autonomous status of the Skræling puts them in danger, but they have hitherto strongly resisted integration owing to fears of becoming just another colony. The liberal Vinlandic regime, however, has instilled a newfound level of cautious trust among leading Skræling officials and influential chiefs. While Vinlandic and Skræling representatives are still working out the details, we may be able to unite our nations together to ward off the Belgian and Plantagenian threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.A;Let us hope that they work swiftly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.T;Birth of the Federal Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.D;After round after round of discussions between Vinlandic officials and tribal authorities, it has been decided that the Skræling Territory concept proved unworkable. A wholly artificial Scandinavian construct from the very beginning, there was no way to maintain it within our nation while ensuring full representation to all the tribes. Therefore, the entire system has been eliminated, and replaced with federal territories adjusted for each major tribal group involved. Rather than vesting power in this or that group over another, the federal territories will allow each community to protect its culture within our national framework. This will, of course, only be extended to the ex-Skræling tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.A;Another broken system replaced by enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.T;The Great Skræling Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.D;When we announced the incorporation of the Skræling lands, we expected resistance from the natives, but nothing too substantial – after all, the Territory is an artificial construct barely holding itself together, with no cultural foundation to unify it. It seems that our judgment was incorrect. A charismatic native preacher named Tarhe has led the growth of a syncretic faith incorporating Christian, Iroquois, and Algonquin religious elements – and he has not taken our actions lying down. His “Sikariere,” as the believers are known, have taken up arms against us. Many natives who are not particularly zealous have still flocked to the movement, seeing it as the main form of resistance to our rule. Now the Sikariere have overrun the Skræling government and declared full independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.A;Crush those mad heathen savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.T;Triumph over Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.D;The holy book of the Christians tells that the two greatest prophets were Moses and Jesus, one who came to rescue his people, the other to redeem all people. The faith and traditions of the native peoples tell of many heroes and sages of their own. But, surely, one has now risen above all others : the Prophet Tarhe, Praised Be His Holy Name! The Great Crane has led our crusade to victory over the infidels. As our sacred hosts of holy warriors sweep across the north, all our indigenous kindred are being liberated from their servitude and restored to their old lands. Righteous vengeance shall be inflicted upon all the decadent cities of the east, and all false idols cast down. Across the world, heretic and heathen alike are confounded and astonished by our triumph. Let the pillars of Hell tremble, for the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth is soon to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.A;§RGOD IS GREAT! GOD IS GREAT!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.T;The Last of the Skræling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.D;There was an idea, created in Copenhagen but born out in Arcadia : an idea of the Skræling, of the Great Lakes and all of their tribes brought together within a single government. That notion – that political reality – has been murdered. It has perished on a dozen battlefields, it has burned with a hundred villages, it has slipped into the sky from a thousand wailing, mournful cries of mothers, daughters, and sisters who shall never see their sons, fathers, and brothers again. The Vinlandic government has broken up all major native communities, forcing them to congregate in a small area known simply as the Consolidated Lands. All the rest of their domain has been placed in the trust of the Vinlandic administration, to be sold off or allotted as they see fit. Tens of thousands of natives are being driven from their homes, never to return. Many will not even reach the Consolidated Lands. The emaciated, diseased, despairing survivors shall be the last of the Skræling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.A;Every trail has its end, and every calamity brings its lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.T;Vinland Rebuked;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.D;God is great! We have repelled the Vinlandic infidels and safeguarded our holy nation. Despite their haughty dispositions and so-called “advanced” technologies, they proved no match for our valorous crusaders and their indomitable resolve. Their invasion’s humiliating failure left their tyrannical leader with no choice but to recognize our sacred realm as a free and independent nation. Let the vile northerners suffer and rot in their den of iniquity. We shall live, free and blessed, within our New Jerusalem, under the wise hand of the Prophet Tarhe, Praise Be His Holy Name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.A;Zion stands unconquered and unbowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.T;A Struggle in the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.D;The end of foreign rule has opened the floodgates of political discourse across our nation, and the matter has reached the National Council itself. The only thing that most citizens can agree on is that we must embrace some sort of unifying policy to prevent total dissolution. It is tempting to take this opportunity to curtail all foreign influences and focus on internal development, forming an alliance of tribes without radical reform. This might leave us vulnerable, however, which is why others advocate a modernized, confederal system guided by a strong head of state and a more engaging foreign policy. The Sikariere on the council have made their own recommendations for a theocratic regime, and strange as it may sound they have accumulated a noteworthy following amongst the people. Where shall the future of the Skræling lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.A;Tradition and unity will keep us safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.B;We need a confederation with a strong president and military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.C;The Great Crane shall guide us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.T;The Jesuit Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.D;We had allowed the Jesuits into our nation in good faith, on the grounds of giving both Protestant and Catholic missionaries equal treatment. That trust has now been violated by the machinations of Plantagenia. A revolt has now been organized in the southwest, in which the tribes of the region – who have largely converted to Catholicism – have requested Plantagenian “protection!” We cannot be certain of how many Jesuits were in on the scheme, or whether they orchestrated it voluntarily or were intimidated by the Plantagenians, but that doesn’t matter right now. As of this moment all authority in the southwest has collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.A;This is TREASON!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.T;Creation of the Four Fires Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.D;In a completely unexpected turn of events, the major tribes of the southwestern Skræling have declared independence under the banner of the Four Fires Council. It just so happens that many of them have converted to Catholicism under the influence of the Jesuits amongst them. As we all know, the Indians of the Great Lakes are heathen savages, so it wouldn’t be right to leave fellow Catholics to their mercy. The only humane thing to do is to take them under our wing and “protect” them. A Plantagenian military detachment has already departed for their capital to…arrange the terms of this protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.A;It’s for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN35.T;The Jesuit Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN35.D;We had allowed the Jesuits into our nation in good faith, on the grounds of giving both Protestant and Catholic missionaries equal treatment. It seems that trust was a dangerous policy. Word has reached us from sympathetic citizens that pro-Plantagenian elements of the Jesuits were involved in a scheme to foment separatism amongst the southwestern Catholics! Thankfully, it seems that Plantagenia did not coordinate well with their supposed agents, nor did the agents keep the plan sufficiently secret. Edicts have already been promulgated expelling the Jesuits from our nation. This has caused some minor unrest amongst the Catholics but nowhere near the amount of danger which could have arisen had the Cadien plot succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARGEN35.A;I always knew that those Jesuits were up to something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.T;Failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.D;Our plans to engineer the secession of the southwestern Indian lands have been thwarted! It seems that the Jesuits suffered from both internal infighting over the morality of our actions, and a lack of secrecy – at least one of their native conspirators betrayed them and confessed the plot to the authorities. Now, the entire Jesuit Society has been expelled by the Skræling, and all separatist sentiments crushed. Furthermore, a wave of anti-Jesuit and to an extent anti-Catholic hysteria is now ripping through the Skræling. Not only are those lands now beyond our reach save by use of direct force, but we have poisoned our relations with the Skræling for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.A;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.T;Confederal Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.D;Our government has struggled to hold itself together since we were thrust into independence. Now even that desperate endeavor has ended. News of Belgian forces crossing the eastern border ignited an inextinguishable blaze of chaos across our lands. Various tribes have declared independence or even sought protection from Vinland to save themselves from the wrath of the Belgians. Our nation has crumbled before our very eyes. Nobody can say what the future of the Great Lakes will be, but it is now obvious that the Skræling as a united people will not play a part in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.A;Our people are no more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.T;The Four Fires Council Requests Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.D;The Belgian invasion of the Skræling triggered the collapse of their nation. It seems that they were even less united than many had supposed. Now, with various tribes free to feud with one another as the northerners pick over the Skræling corpse, the southwestern Catholic tribes have come together. Establishing a smaller federation known as the Four Fires Council, they have petitioned us for military protection. The Council has offered to surrender control of its foreign affairs to us as a condition of said arrangement. This is a splendid opportunity and we have no reason to refuse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.A;Of course we shall protect our fellow Catholics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.T;The Scramble for the Iroquois;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.D;The collapse of the Skræling nation has caused the Iroquois, formerly the most economically influential component of the Skræling, to return to independence. However, they hold lands which both our nation and our neighbor have long coveted. They have expressed no interest in arranging a formal division of the Iroquois territory. Thus, we are now competing for whomever can compel the Iroquois to capitulate first. To the victor goes the Iroquois nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.A;The race is on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.T;The War of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.D;Nobody amongst our government was under any illusion that the settlers at our borders would leave us alone. Now, the Belgians have decided to strike. Their leader recently gave a pompous speech full of hollow and mean phrases which can be summarized as their brutal attempt to lay claim to our ancestral lands. Now we are faced with a hard choice. It is possible that we might be able to concede only part of their desired territories and persuade them to be satisfied with just a piece of our eastern lands. It would be a painful parting but it would spare both of us bloodshed. The alternative is to stand and fight. While no doubt the honorable and valorous choice, Belgium is a strong and wealthy country, and it is unlikely that we could defeat them. But, do we not owe our ancestors one final show of defiance to our enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.A;We shall not go gentle into the dark night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.B;True courage makes sacrifices for peace, not war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.T;The Belgians Invade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.D;When we concluded our latest treaty with the Belgians, there were those amongst our people who said that we were being foolish – that the Belgians would never be satisfied with the lands that they acquired. Those fears have now been proven accurate. The Belgians have crossed into our lands once again, and this time they have vowed not to stop until our entire nation comes under their dominion. Now, we must ride out to face them – to face our destiny, whatever it may be. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.A;History shall tell that we died standing rather than live kneeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.T;The Skræling are Under Siege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.D;For well over a century, the Belgians have coveted the notion of westward expansion into the Skræling lands. Now that the natives are vulnerable, they have seized the opportunity to strike. Judging by their rhetoric, they seem set on conquering as much of the Skræling as they can. Therefore, we have only a limited window of opportunity to act, or else lose them forever to the Belgians. Some see the entirety of the Great Lakes as our own natural frontier and want us to demand an immediate end to the Belgian invasion, threatening war if they refuse. Others believe that the Belgians could be made to negotiate and agree on a division of the lands with us. A few determined pacifists simply do not want to get involved. How shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.A;Send the ultimatum and ready the troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.B;We must at least attempt diplomacy first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.C;Leave the Skræling to their fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.T;Vinland Threatens Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.D;Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. Vinland has presented an ultimatum : End our current war immediately, or else they shall intervene on the side of the Skræling. While it is unclear if they possess the military might to enforce such a threat, few members of our government relish the thought of a two-front war. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time to mull over our response : the Vinlanders demand an immediate reply. What shall we answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.A;We’ll see you on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.B;We have no choice but to acquiesce…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.T;A Partition Agreement with Vinland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.D;Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. The Vinlanders have approached us, privately, to offer an arrangement regarding the Great Lakes. Under the terms of the proposed secret treaty, our two nations would partition the Skræling roughly in half along a north-south line, with Vinland keeping the north and ourselves the south. The resulting borders seem fair, and our military must have made an impression on the Vinlanders for them to offer a division of the Indian lands rather than seek to keep us out of them entirely. Still, we are under no obligations to accept, but they may declare war if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.A;It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.B;We will not compromise on our manifest destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.T;The Vinlandic Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.D;The ruling classes of Vinland have always treated us with paternalistic high-handedness, and we have never forgotten their foreign nature. Few amongst us, however, predicted this latest, brutal development. Vinland, in the name of “safeguarding” the tribes of the north, has marched its armies into our hinterlands! Worse, we have received reports of Vinlandic and Belgian troops cooperating in the field! With our entire focus on the Belgian front we have little hope of preventing this vile deception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.A;Fratricide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.T;The Belgians Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.D;Our proposal was approved by the Belgian government. With our forces already heading south to occupy our allotted lands, we should expect resistance from the Skræling but nothing that we cannot handle. Few people within our government enjoy the prospect of the Belgians seizing the southern lands, but at least we shall be able to preserve the northern Great Lakes for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.A;Now to make it official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.T;The Belgians have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.D;Our proposal was denied by the greedy Belgians. They have asserted that the lands of the Great Lakes shall be theirs and theirs alone! If we wish to prevent this, then war is our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.A;Then let battle be joined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.B;We must accept the new Arcadian order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.T;The Skræling Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.D;The Vinlandic government has surprised many indigenous peoples across Arcadia with its relatively humane and tolerant treatment of natives, at least in comparison to its contemporaries. Their administration is far from perfect, but their conciliatory stance on native rights by all accounts appears to be genuine. Thus, a sense of cautious optimism has begun sweeping our people, who are now wondering if we might be able to find a place of equal standing beside the Vinlanders. A new law is now being voted on by the National Council. If passed, then we shall formally petition Vinland for annexation. Due to their laws on the protection of native cultures, it is hoped that we would be able to preserve both our traditions and our lands while enjoying the economic and political fruits of Vinlandic citizenship. The votes are tallied, and…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.A;The jas have it! §R(AUTO-ANNEXATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.B;The neis have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.T;The Skræling Petition for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.D;Our sweeping protection of native rights have been hailed amongst the Skræling as a new chapter in Arcadian history. A mood of Vinland pan-nationalism is sweeping the Skræling, who are beginning to accept what we ourselves have always known to be true : that Vinland is their best and most responsible steward. Now a formal request has been received from their National Council, requesting their annexation into our nation! This request was, of course, conditioned on the granting of cultural and land rights to the Skræling, terms which our administration is more than happy to accept. This is a tremendous victory and further enshrines Vinland as the standard bearer of Arcadian unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.A;What are we waiting for? We accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.T;Vinland Annexes the Skræling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.D;Our plan to engineer the secession of the southwestern Catholic tribes of the Skræling has failed in an unexpected way. It appears that the radical Vinlandic government bent so far backwards to appease the Indians that they joined their nation voluntarily! Many of our officials are in disbelief at this turn of events, muttering of coups and bribes, but as of now, the entirety of the Great Lakes region is now Vinlandic territory. Our efforts amongst the Catholics of the south have come to naught. The only bright spot is that the Vinlanders seem unaware of our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.A;What a waste…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.T;A Border Treaty with Vinland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.D;Our ownership of Potomimark has disquieted Vinland, who feel as though we have occupied a dangerous amount of former Skræling land. They have now proposed a treaty that would condone our occupation of more southernly lands in exchange for ceding Potomimark to them. If we accept, then this will likely put an end to our border conflicts with Vinland. §RIt would also prevent us from claiming further Skræling lands in the future. If we intend to pursue a greater Arcadian destiny, however, then we may want to avoid making such a bitter enemy of Vinland, lest they take advantage of a future moment of our weakness to enact vengeance.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.A;This seems like a fair compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.B;We fought for these lands, and they are ours and ours alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN54.D;Our ownership of Eriesland has created friction with Belgium, who are greatly desirous of access to the Great Lakes. They have now proposed a treaty that would ratify our ownership of the western Skræling lands in exchange for ceding Eriesland to them, to avoid war over the issue in the future. If we accept, then this will likely put an end to our border conflicts with Belgium. §RIt is tempting to flatly refuse this request on principle – it would mean permanently losing control of Eriesland - but it may not be wise to make a bitter enemy out of the Belgians.§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN54.A;This seems like a fair compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN56.T;The Arcadian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.D;Now that the New Arcadians have come to power within Belgium, and sorted out most of its internal political divisions, they have approached us regarding incorporation into their own nation. We had seceded alongside the Belgians during the first war with Plantagenia, and now pan-Arcadianism is driving many Louisianais to support Belgian statehood. The culture of Belgium, emphasizing egalitarianism and the value of hard work and personal achievement, is far more attractive than Plantagenia’s elitist aristocracy and slavish Europhilia. The tide of pan-Arcadian nationalism which is now sweeping through our nation has now become too strong to be ignored. It may also be too strong to be denied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.A;We shall dare to dream the Arcadian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.B;Louisiane for the Louisianais!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN57.T;The Arcadian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN57.D;Our nation was founded upon the bedrock of absolute independence, but recent events in Belgium have caused certain liberals amongst us to reconsider that notion. The New Arcadians, having come to power in Belgium and sorted out most of its internal political divisions, are now urging us to seriously consider the prospect of unification with their nation. Reactionaries decry the idea of “selling out our homeland, so newly won, to yet more white men,” but the New Arcadians are not typical of their race. They are racial progressives, who count many strident abolitionists – including black abolitionists – within their ranks. Moreover, they have also pushed for greater equality between the races. And if we were to accept unification, our size and status as a free country give us the negotiating power to safeguard our cultural and civil rights. The tide of pan-Arcadian nationalism which is now sweeping through our nation has now become too strong to be ignored. It may also be too strong to bedenied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN58.D;“Men grow tired of sleep, love, singing and dancing sooner than of war.” – Homer\n\nIt had been hoped that the differences of Belgium and Plantagenia were settled when they clashed over Vierset – that the Arcadian War had given both states a path to find a way to live with one another. But the Old Arcadians of Belgium did not want peace : they wanted the absolute submission of their enemies. Now, Plantagenia is rallying their own forces to meet them on the field of battle once again. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be subordinated to the pan-Arcadian dream, another pawn in Belgium’s great game for hegemony. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation. The conclusion of a decades-long vendetta begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN59.D;“Men grow tired of sleep, love, singing and dancing sooner than of war.” – Homer\n\nIt had been hoped that the differences of Belgium and Plantagenia were settled when they clashed over Vierset – that the Arcadian War had given both states a path to find a way to live with one another. But the New Arcadians of Belgium have a dream – the Arcadian Dream, the idea of a new and united nation brought forth upon the continent – and they will make any sacrifice to force Plantagenia to accept it. Now, the Cadiens are rallying their own forces to meet them on the field of battle once again. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be subordinated to the pan-Arcadian dream, another pawn in Belgium’s great game for hegemony. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation. The conclusion of a decades-long vendetta begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN60.T;The Duel of the Fates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN60.D;The Arcadian War, which was presumed to be the final struggle between ourselves and the Belgians, was not so final after all. The Belgian government has fallen into the hands of a clique of bellicose Arcadian pan-nationalists who demand nothing less than the total subjugation of our country! The invasion has evoked a rare sense of unity crossing ideological and class lines. Cadiens rich and poor are setting aside their differences to defend our nation from the northern hordes, as the States General passes an emergency mobilization bill. At stake is Plantagenia’s very nationhood. If – and when – we prevail, then we shall ensure that Belgium will never be able to threaten us, or any other country, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But Belgium could not accept that Plantagenia would ever be a benevolent neighbor, nor could they forgive or forget the injustices visited upon them during Plantagenia’s pursuit of an Arcadian Empire. Now Belgian armies are marching south to deliver final vengeance unto the Cadiens. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be excoriated beyond hope of recovery. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation.

ARCGEN62.T;The War of Northern Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN62.D;The Arcadian War, which was presumed to be the final struggle between ourselves and the Belgians, was not so final after all. The Belgian government has embarked upon a totally unjustified punitive campaign to cripple our nation! The invasion has evoked a rare sense of unity crossing ideological and class lines. Cadiens rich and poor are setting aside their differences to defend our nation from the northern hordes, as the States General passes an emergency mobilization bill. At stake is Plantagenia’s very national sovereignty. If – and when – we prevail, then we shall ensure that Belgium will never be able to threaten us, or any other country, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN62.A;To arms, to arms, to arms, to arms in Cadie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN63.T;Formation of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN63.D;The Belgians entered into war against us under the rather childish delusion that they were going to subjugate everyone, and nobody was going to subjugate them. However, the stabilization of our national politics has begun to evoke a different form of pan-Arcadianism amongst our ruling classes, one built upon solid principles of tradition. Now that the Belgians have been vanquished, we shall give them a taste of their own medicine. A military administration has been formed under Plantagenian control to prepare the lands of the north for integration into a pan-Arcadian state of our own. This is a complex process, as many Belgians are…not excited by the prospect of being subsumed by our country for a second time. Furthermore, guerilla bands have already begun cropping up across the region. More serious is the fact that this massive occupation is proving an enormous strain upon our bureaucracy and treasury. We shall have to quickly consolidate our newfound status as the leader of Arcadian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN63.A;It is time to reconstruct the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN64.T;The Dissolution of the Belgian Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN64.D;The latest war against the Belgians has made it plain that a unified Belgium will always be a threat to the peace and stability of the rest of Arcadia. Therefore, we have taken it upon ourselves to dismantle the Confederacy. Both Basse and Haute Valoise, along with any Belgian-held Iroquois lands, are now under our control. The remaining Belgian states have been restored to their prior sovereignty, and all legal documents which previously bound them have been abrogated by vote of the Belgian States General (with our own soldiers posted outside the building at time of voting). It is not inconceivable that some future generation of northerners may arise to rekindle the flame of Belgian nationalism, but if they do, then we shall stomp it out once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN64.A;Let it never be said that we do not support states’ rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN65.T;Formation of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN65.D;The time has come at last. Southern Arcadia has been utterly defeated and is ready to be remade in our image. A new administration has been instituted within the Cadien lands, supplied in large part by our own military. It will spread the message of pan-Arcadianism throughout the southern lands and ensure a smooth transition when the time comes to finalize our unification. However, we have received reports of guerilla warfare by both white and black partisans against our forces. Moreover, the occupation of such a vast territory has greatly strained our bureaucracy and our treasury. We shall have to conclude our Arcadian unification plans with the utmost speed or else risk Plantagenia slipping out of our grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN66.T;The Partition of Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN66.D;When our ancestors led the revolution against Plantagenia, they fought for survival against the southern menace. Now it has fallen to us, their descendants, to end any possibility of Plantagenia becoming a threat to Arcadia. Any contested lands held by Plantagenia shall be granted full liberty, reducing them down to their core territories. We have heard rumors that the Louisianais may seek unification with Belgium, but nothing is certain. For now, let us rejoice in the culmination of the effort begun by our revolutionary forefathers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN66.A;From every mountainside, let freedom ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN666.T;The Day of Reckoning;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN666.D;With our catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Belgians, our nation has seen territorial losses on all fronts. We had consoled ourselves with the hope that we could still retain enough plantation lands to keep financially solvent. The long-suffering slaves, however, had other ideas. Seeing their masters laid low to an unprecedented degree, a few free black partisans were emboldened to begin orchestrating local slave revolts. Ordinarily we would have been able to put them down, but the total shattering of our military left us struggling to stamp out even the mere embers of anarchy. Before long, the whole eastern section of our remaining territory was aflame with rebellion. In the chaos, a certain knight disappeared – only to resurface as the head of the black serpent! Sir Louis Lafayette de Saint-Georges – the apparent mastermind of this conspiracy – has been acclaimed leader of this new abomination, this Liberie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN666.A;Our debt to the children of Africa, come due at last…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6666.T;The Eenwording;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6666.D;The emergence of Louisiane from Plantagenia’s tyrannical grip was joyous news to all Belgians, but none were as happy as the Burgundians. At long last, our program of unification with our southern brothers can now be completed! We have already sent representatives to the Louisianais to guide them through this transitional period. Through friendly negotiation (and perhaps a bit of bribery), the Louisianais government agreed to become our newest state, and a bill to such effect has just been approved by the States-General and signed into law by the Stadtholder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6666.A;Louisiane, redeemed at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN670.T;Futilité;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN670.D;”This is not peace. It is an armistice for thirty years.” – Belgian General Willem Bosch\n\nA nightmare has descended over Arcadia, as Belgium and Southern Arcadia have covered their lands in carnage only to fight one another to mutual exhaustion. Both sides finally agreed to meet in Vierset and discuss peace negotiations. To the agony of both powers, the only terms which they were both willing to accept were those of status quo ante bellum. The outrage and despair in both countries, having sacrificed so much for nothing, will imperil political stability within them for years to come – to say nothing of the international embarrassment. The war seems to have extinguished the pan-Arcadian spirit amongst Cadiens, but the mood among Belgians is harder to judge. While the Dutch League is more pacifist now than ever, both the Old and New Arcadians seem to have merely been embittered, and the Burgundians are divided amongst many different views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN670.A;Will the cycle continue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN67.T;Destiny Within Reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN67.D;We are entering the final stages of Arcadian unification. As our administration prepares for the merging of our nations, we must consider the mood across the rest of the continent, chiefly in Vinland and Qingqiu. Our diplomats report that the Qingqiuese are intensely anxious at the prospect of Belgium and Plantagenia merging into a single country, and they shall likely seek some type of border adjustment in the west as a precondition of supporting Arcadian unification. Vinland is less certain : if we have deprived them of lands in the Great Lakes which they saw as rightfully theirs, they shall likely demand their return, but if not then they may acquiesce. §GIn fourteen days, the unification of Arcadia will be announced.§RIf we receive an objection from Qingqiu or Vinland within that time, we must prepare for either compromise or war.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN68.T;The Inevitable Unification of Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN68.D;As we had feared, Belgium and Plantagenia’s latest titanic clash has caused the victor to seek to force the defeated to unify with their own nation. If this occurs, then they will upend the Arcadian balance of power – their prospective population alone will make any future war against them all but unwinnable. Yet now they are vulnerable, and they currently hold former Skræling lands which rightfully belong to us. Now is our last chance to demand the Great Lakes basin in its entirety! If they refuse, then force will be our only other option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The prospect of a unified Arcadia has sent a wave of fear through Erikshavn and now they are seeking any form of assurance that we would not be able to dominate them in the future.

Yet now they are vulnerable, and our eastern garrisons hold a commanding position. Now is our last chance to demand an officially demarcated eastern frontier, and to force any future Arcadian state to forswear further western expansion!

One side seeks to bring forth upon the continent a new nation – the other seeks to prevent this at all costs. Vinland has, for one reason or another, bowed out of the contention, leaving Qingqiu to face down its rival alone.

ARCGEN77.D;There will be no unification of Arcadia – the foes of its pan-nationalists have now seen to that. The great cities of Belgium and Plantagenia are now smouldering ruins, banners of foreign nations flying above them. The treaty which ended the war – negotiated in, of all places, Vierset – has completely destroyed eastern Arcadia. All of the former Skræling Territories have been awarded to Vinland, and various nations have been made independent across the region. Oumessourita has become a Qingqiuan protectorate, and a truncated Plantagenia has had its monarchy forced into exile, and a democratic, abolitionist regime established in its stead. The Nouvel Bruges stock market has been closed for weeks – nobody can bear to watch it crash. The Old and New Arcadian parties are considering dissolution or at least renaming – they no longer have a reason to exist. The Arcadian Dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN770.T;The Oumessouritan Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.D;Now that the easterners have been vanquished, we have secured the region of Oumessouritan as a protectorate. However, the treaty does not stipulate what measures we must take in order to protect it. As our armies are already garrisoning most of its territory, it would be a simple matter to annex it. The only problem which might emerge is the difficulty of governing such a vast expanse of land on the other side of the Mingxingshan Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.A;It is a risk that we can afford to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN78.D;Ad astra per aspera! We have overcome all obstacles, vanquished all adversaries, in our unstoppable journey towards Arcadian unification. Neither Vinland, nor Qingqiu, nor any other power in Arcadia or the world has been able to stand against us. Our provisional government in the occupied territories reports that the political situation there is now stable enough for unification to commence. We now stand at the threshold of a new era – the era of Pax Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN78.A;Glory, glory, hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN79.T;A Golden Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN79.D;Oumessourita is currently locked in a struggle against the newly united nation of Arcadia. If Arcadia were to prevail, it would put them uncomfortably close to our heartland. Therefore, we must act now to preserve our frontier. The western part of Oumessourita has long been claimed by our nation, and now, with the Oumessouritans occupied, we can seize control of them. In all likelihood this will cause Oumessourita to fall to Arcadia, but our fait accompli will deny them the ability to lay claim to the lands which we obtain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN82.T;The Honest Truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN82.D;The war situation has proceeded not necessarily to Vinland’s advantage. Arcadia, now that it has emerged as a unified state, is in a position of overwhelming military strength. In terms of population, economy, and army size, they are now thoroughly superior to us. They have thus imposed upon us an onerous “revision” of the borders between our nations which amounts to the unilateral seizure of the former Skræling territory. All we can do now is prepare ourselves for the possibility of one day being able to reclaim them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN82.A;We knew the risks and now suffer the consequences…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.T;The Arcadian Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.D;Now that Arcadia is unified, they have sought to expand their borders northwards by demanding that we cede them the southern section of the former Skræling lands. It is tempting to refuse the ultimatum on principle, but unfortunately, Arcadia possesses some amount of leverage in this situation due to the complex political history of the Great Lakes region which has entangled both of our nations. While we have managed to negotiate them down from seeking nearly all of our southern frontier, this seems to be the minimum which they are willing to accept. If we refuse, it could mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.A;It is the only way to normalize relations with the Arcadians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.B;Come and take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.T;Arcadian Bluster;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.D;Now that Arcadia is unified, they have sought to expand their borders northward by demanding that we cede them the southern section of the former Skræling territory. This is, naturally, seen as an outrageous proposition, as Arcadia has no justifications for laying claim to said lands. We may wish to concede the Iroquois and southern Illimark lands to Arcadia anyway to avoid all-out war with the southerners. However, several members of the cabinet, not to mention the populace at large, think that we should take a stand against the southerners, or at least resist their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.A;War would be a catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.B;We will not be bullied by a band of southern despots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.T;Vinland Defies Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.D;The foolish Vinlanders have refused to see reason, believing against all evidence that they are under no obligation to relinquish our rightful lands. Given the amount of political capital which we have invested in this endeavor, backing down now would be publicly humiliating for our administration and our nation. However, the only other recourse left to us is war, and if Vinland has formed alliances with foreign powers then igniting a general conflict on the continent could be troublesome indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.A;This is not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.B;We will not be pushed around by a bunch of inbred lumberjacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.T;Victory over Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.D;The eyes of the ravenous southerners proved bigger than their stomachs – the brave forces of Vinland showed them what happens to those who challenge our territorial integrity! Our decisive defeat of the Arcadians has allowed us to demand their complete departure from the Skræling lands. Several areas had, it appears, already begun to fall back into the hands of local, indigenous authorities by the time that the Arcadians were beaten. At long last, all of the territories of the Great Lakes are in our rightful hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.A;Glory to Vinland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN87.T;The Great Lakes are Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN87.D;The Vinlanders doubted the power of Arcadia, but we showed them just how wrong they were as we shattered their armies in battle after battle! Now that Erikshavn has capitulated, the time has come to fully secure the lands of the Great Lakes region. These rich territories shall be of great use to our mighty nation, and we shall doubtlessly have no shortage of settlers for them. Vinland has now been shown its proper place, deferential to the rightful hegemon of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Already we have made arrangements with the political elites of Carolina and Philippa to ensure the rights of the Belgian coloured people and segregation laws alongside anti-miscegenation laws have been effectively banned, paving the way for racial equality in the rest of Arcadia. Moreover, all Black inhabitants of the newly established Republics have been given Liberian citizenship, and should they be threatened, our armed forces will intervene directly against their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

ARCGEN640.D;The Liberian state has been erased from existence and our administrators have contacted the remaining Cadien elites to bring back order in both Louisiane and Acadianie. While we have assured the Liberians that their rights will not be trampled, we have already made sure that the new political order will favor back the Cadiens rather than the descendants of freedmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

ARCGEN1001.T;German Immigration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARCGEN1001.D;Germans have been immigrating to our nation for some time, but now they are coming in unprecedented numbers. Our port cities have been deluged by German immigrants fleeing political upheaval, economic turmoil, and of course the Hollowing, the great famine sweeping central Europe. While they come from diverse backgrounds, and practice various forms of Christianity or Judaism, most people see them as one single “riotous mass of savages,” in the words of one prominent businessman. Indeed many political cartoonists have compared this migratory wave to the barbarian invasions of Rome. German immigrants have also brought radical politics, denouncing slavery in particular. The influx of cheap migrant labor has further alarmed those who have relied upon forms of forced or coerced labor in the past. Despite a surge of nativism within our nation  - and many Germans intending to return to Europe when the “crisis” is over - it seems that they will become part of our national fabric.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

develop_frederikstad_title;Develop Frederikstad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
develop_frederikstad_desc;The island of Kongsberg, named for the hill overlooking the city of Frederikstad has seen great developments since the end of colonial rule. Works on the Frysja river has allowed ships to sail up to the island and the new Tekina canal allows them to circumvene the treacherous rapids located mere miles south of the city. The port of Frederikstad has thus become the new great port of Vinland, located between the Great Lakes, the capital and the Belgian cities through the new railways. While Erikshavn remains the capital and the cultural heart of the nation, everyone acknowledges that the industrial might will be born in Frederikstad where the immigrants are already flowing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

treaty_of_vinland_desc;Despite the efforts of our old overlords, the Royal Scandinavian Army and Navy have failed to subjugate us once again. We have endured to the point that many in Scandinavia now believe the war to be hopeless. As expenditures mount and the Scandinavian royal treasury feels the pain of their exertions, let us make a push for peace to force them to the negotiating table. The Venetians, being neutral parties in this war, have offered to host a diplomatic conference in Venezia to establish a final peace agreement. We shall at last secure our liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

end_of_security_committee_desc;Now that our moment of danger has passed, and the enemies of the revolution defeated, there is a growing sense amongst our people that the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité has served its purpose. The institution’s broad powers were useful during the revolution and in the chaos and violence which followed, but now people are clamoring for true democracy. Most onerous to them is the fact that Sikkerhetskomité members rule by decree and cannot be elected or voted out of office. To avoid a reactionary counter-revolution, we will declare the emergency over and dissolve the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité. Its final act before being dissolved will be to establish a new constitution to guarantee the freedoms of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA_exploit_the_jesuits_desc;With the growth and support of the Society of Jesuits within the southern Skræling Confederacy, they and their Catholic faithful have reached unprecedented levels of influence. Bellicose members of the cabinet believe that we could force these priests to stir their Indian believers to revolt against the Skræling government. While previously this would’ve been suppressed by Scandinavia, Copenhagen has lost control of the Great Lakes and the Indians are likely to be unable to put down the revolt before we can ‘intervene’ to ‘protect’ them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_annex_NUN_title;Annex the Four Fires Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_annex_NUN_desc;Now that the Four Fires Council has been liberated from the Skræling, we should…bring them more fully under our protection. After all, much of their lands are undeveloped, and it would be irresponsible to let them remain so backward and isolated. Many of them are Catholics as well, and we cannot allow our brothers and sisters in the faith to either be reabsorbed by the Skræling or, even worse, fall prey to the Belgians or even the Vinlanders. Therefore, the only responsible thing to do is to bring our enlightened rule to the region and establish the full flower of civilization within it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_title;Assert our Manifest Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_desc;Centuries ago, when the Burgundians first settled this land, charters were handed down which allotted vast swathes of eastern Arcadia to our colonial predecessors. These borders ran all the way to the Great Lakes, but the Scandinavians eventually secured hegemony in the region and Burgundy was forced to halt its expansion at the Allegheny Mountain valleys. The demise of Scandinavian influence within the Skræling Confederacy offers us a new opportunity to at last claim the western lands which have always truly been ours. The time has come to bring civilization and enlightenment to this primitive land. Go west, young man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_title;Pass the Indian Removal Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_desc;When the Western Territories were acquired by $COUNTRY$, many Belgian politicians wanted to find a way to avoid the violent conflict which was guaranteed to erupt between the natives and the settlers. The proposal which won out was to establish a certain region in which the natives could be concentrated and brought to live with one another, as part of a controlled program rather than driven out by settlers themselves. The intent was to transplant native communities to this new safe zone as quickly and cleanly as possible. In truth, the program was a horrifying disaster. Many indigenous communities were destroyed, thousands died from malnutrition or disease on the journey, and those that did arrive eventually fought amongst one another for the meager slivers of land they were allotted by the government. Nevertheless, at the time the policy was seen as a merciful way to save the Indians from the racial violence which had occurred in states like Flande Superyeure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_title;Finish the Western Drive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_desc;The lands which we acquired from the Indians have been a great benefit to our nation, but they are hardly sufficient on their own. Far better would be to secure the rest of the Indian lands, to bring them the fruits of our modern civilization, as well as people enlightened enough to make use of such things. What’s more, we have found older Burgundian documents showing that the furthest western lands of the Indians were accorded to our colonial predecessors by the Burgundian Crown! Clearly, all available evidence points to these lands rightfully belonging to us. We have no reason to tolerate this mistake of Scandinavian foreign policy any longer. All of the Great Lakes shall fly the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VIN_liberal_annexation_SKR_title;Annex the Skræling Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VIN_liberal_annexation_SKR_desc;With our political situation now stabilized, the time has come to integrate the Skræling lands into our own nation. We cannot allow their autonomous status to be used by the Belgians or the Cadiens to cleave them away from us. While full accord with the natives will have to wait until this is accomplished, at the very least we will be able to make guarantees that their rights and cultures will be respected. By establishing these lands as full components of our nation, we will ease their introduction into our administration. This will also dissuade the natives from attempting to organize resistance against our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VIN_conservative_annexation_SKR_desc;With our political situation now stabilized, the time has come to integrate the Skræling lands into our own nation. It will be necessary to place these lands under proper government control until they have been sufficiently developed to be raised up to the standard of the rest of our nation. Still, we shall do our utmost to bring civilization to these backward lands and make them another proud part of Vinland. We have heard rumors of some sort of religious cult organizing anti-Vinlandic movements in the area, but surely those must be overblown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
taking_rialto_title;Launch the Rialto Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
taking_rialto_desc;Ever since the Dual Monarchy and Venice arrived in Arcadia, the border between the Anglois colonies of the north and the Venetian slave trading outpost in the south was poorly defined. The swamp lands in between – not to mention the ferocious natives – made any attempt by either power to push the frontier all but impossible. This remained true even after Plantagenia became independent, with Rialto absorbing many escaped slaves. For decades, Rialto has been claimed by both Plantagenia and Venice on their respective maps yet administered by neither of them. However, recent technological advances in infrastructure and medicine may allow us to finally bring the region under our control. We will deploy a military contingent to clear the way for the first wave of settlers and locate areas favorable to establishing new towns. As soon as the new colonists arrive, our claim to the Rialto region will be transformed into fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG_DESTROY_LOU_BURGUNDIAN_desc;With Plantagenian rule on the Atlantic coast now merely a memory, the time has come to do what our ancestors could not. The great men of Louisiane fought with them during our struggle for independence, and their immortal memories demand that we rectify the injustices of the past.

NBG_LIBERATE_LOU_NEW_ARCADIAN_desc;Ever since the end of the Belgian Revolution, we have awaited the day in which we could reclaim our lost Louisianais kin, who were kept in bondage by the Plantagenians. Now, that day appears to be in sight. Louisiane is an independent nation, but it is currently unclear whether they will be able to see through the smoke of nationalist fervor to recognize our shared destiny. We will extend a heartfelt request to them for our nations to become one. Of course, if radical isolationist elements have taken control of Louisiane, more forceful measures may be needed…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_LIBERATE_LIB_NEW_ARCADIAN_title;Different Colors, One Purpose;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_LIBERATE_LIB_NEW_ARCADIAN_desc;Libérie was born out of the brutal injustices wreaked upon the black population by the Planteurs and all who supported them. While we must not minimize or deny the suffering which they endured, our hope remains that we can overcome the fears and prejudices which divide our nations and peoples from one another. Both of our nations arose because of Plantagenian tyranny – we both sought abolition, sought emancipation, in one way or another. The cause of Arcadian unification behooves us to appeal to those shared values. If Libérie has been overtaken by some sort of domestic despot, however – especially one fomenting ethnic outrage – then we will have to…do some rearranging before they can be integrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA_MURDER_NBG_FAILSAFE_desc;While we had expected the Belgians to seek vengeance against us after the Arcadian War, they have proven to be reticent. This is unfortunate, since our ministers believe that the best way to rally pan-Arcadianism amongst our own people would be to portray Belgium as an unworthy usurper seeking to steal our rightful claim to leadership of the continent. For this reason, subterfuge must be employed. We shall dispatch a few Louisianais men to conduct aggressive patrols near the Belgian border. Given the infamous belligerence of southern Belgians, they will likely be unable to resist the temptation of attacking. At that point we will be able to declare to the rest of the world that Belgium has declared war upon us and forced us to respond to their aggression in kind.

Where the younger Charles failed, we shall succeed! At long last, no challenges remain to our consolidation of a single, unified Arcadian nation. Europe thinks itself and its ancient crowns supreme, but now, a new power is rising in the west, which shall shake the foundations of the Earth at its coming : The Arcadian Empire, reborn at last.

Our enlightened ideals and vibrant people are the perfect foundation for a new power which shall bear the torch of civilization throughout the continent and the world. Now that we have reached a point of total hegemony, we can at last make the great Arcadian Dream a reality. From this day forward, all old allegiances are cast aside – we are all, now and forever, Arcadians!

KILL_OUM_desc;In the political turmoil of the past, Oumessourita broke free and became an independent state. This is, of course, absurd. A nation consisting of a band of farmers and herders ruling over much of inner Arcadia cannot possibly survive. More to the point, any of our rivals on the other end of the continent could snatch part or all of them up. Oumessourita is the natural western frontier of Arcadia!

treaty_with_VIN_desc;The lands of the Great Lakes possess great mineral and agricultural wealth, and our experts believe that even more remains undiscovered.

We had tried to be reasonable with the Vinlanders regarding the Great Lakes frontier, but they proved unwilling to negotiate in the past. Now we shall announce our intentions to claim the entire region! §RVinland's likelihood to cave in to our demands depends on several factors, including whether we defeated Vinland in the Third Arcadian War and to what extent the Skraelingr lands were disputed in the past.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN31.T;Muru Unquy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN31.D;Smallpox, or “Muru Unquy” in Quechua, is one of the most mortal diseases of the world, and it has significantly targeted the native populations who lacked Europeans’ immunities. However, our empire recovered from the various outbreaks that threatened its population over the centuries, and a widespread use of variolization practice imported from Qingqiu has reduced the threat. Despite these measures, Beornia has become peculiarly deadly to the Inca soldiers stationed there, for the province suffers more outbreaks than any other for reasons not yet explained. Many of our regiments fear an assignation to the “Bloody Plains” and it has created some slight disorganization in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG82.T;Boom of Trade Unionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG82.D;Now that the vast corporations of Les Fiducies have lost their monopolies and thus their control of the labor pool, workers are slowly beginning to understand the necessity and benefits of self-organization. The Union Textile Philippine already boasts more than 80,000 workers, which has led to significant improvements in working conditions and wages in the textile industry. It is clear to us that this trend will continue and the government has already been pressed to enshrine freedom of association by law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG83.T;Le Congrès Syndical Progressiste;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG83.D;Today representatives from nearly 150 unions, large and small, gathered in our capital to hold the first congress of Belgian trade unions. This organization is designed not just to represent workers in their relations with their employers, but also in the political life of our country. It is already known that some of the politicians on the left have announced coalitions in local and national assemblies based on this Congress, and their aim seems to federate all socialist formations into the largest political organization in the New World! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG83.A;This is a democracy, they can assemble as they want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG84.T;Five Hundred Thousand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG84.D;Five hundred thousand! That is the number of members affiliated with the CSP nowadays. In recent years, thanks to negotiations but also strikes and demonstrations, the Congress of Trade unions and Progress has made unprecedented progress on issues important to the common man of the Belgian Confederacy : access to good housing, health care and education. In many places, the Congress had opened its own schools in quarters where housing was also built on Congressiste funds. They also operate special education programs in factory to enlighten the workers and make sure they know their rights. Some politicians have grown alarmed at the importance the Congress now holds over our whole society and there are numerous calls to dissolve this ‘anarchist nest’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG85.T;The Second Belgian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG85.D;The worst fears of the Belgian government came true. After a sweeping reform bill deadlocked in the States-General, a general strike was called by the Congress, which put hundred of thousands on the streets. Factories have shut down, transport has ground to a halt, and all that is heard throughout the cities are the cries of “power to the Congress!” Protesters seize government buildings, in some places peacefully, in others by force and announce the ‘syndicalization’ of industries, taking them away from their rightful owners. The government is confused and many wonder whether or not to fight the Congress… ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG87.D;One of the issues in rebuilding Plantagenia is the reorganization of economic life to restore normalcy as quickly as possible. A celebration was held in Cavaginal today to celebrate the creation of the Corporation des Planteurs Unis d’Akansa (Akansa United Planteur Corporation, CPUA). As part of the Lussevel-Dragd Holding Company, Akansa will develop and expand the traditional plantation economy. The CPUA will also oversee the coordinated buying and selling of bond labor units.  More than one hundred and fifty planteurs have declared their desire to join the corporation, expecting state investments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG88.D;To say that the siege and bombardment of Nouvelle Orleans was disastrous is to say nothing. No less than 80 percent of the city was destroyed, the plumbing system was damaged, and the survivors were wracked with typhoid. The most ardent opponents of Plantagenia say that the city should not be rebuilt at all – and we agree. Our treasury simply could not handle the costs. Fortunately, the Villefeur Corporation has already unveiled an ambitious plan to build, with the finest Belgian and European engineers, a new city upon the ruins of the old. Dubbed Port Villefeur, its straight boulevards, beautiful parks, and stately glass and steel buildings will become a symbol of our greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG89.T;The Black Political Renaissance of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG89.D;Colored people in Arcadia had always been a driving force in politics, even if they were forced to work in the shadows. Be it abolition, civil rights, or economic equality, the black people of Arcadia had pioneered mass mobilization in politics. Now another wave of change is sweeping over the black peoples of our nation, but this time it is far more ominous. The new generation of black artists are drifting towards open militancy faster than we can suppress them, and their messages are spreading. Strange African religious societies cropping up in run-down neighborhoods, booksellers stocking radical works from Europe, political pressure groups operating chapters in cities across the nation – it all has white citizens on edge. The tenor of the black voice in Arcadia is changing, and it is filling with rage at its oppressed status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG89.A;Don’t they have anything better to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG90.T;Protests in Every Southern State;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG90.D;The rising politicization of colored people in Arcadia has provoked a vicious reaction. Lynchings, attacks on black homes and businesses, and a general hostility towards black society is becoming the order of the day in the south. This in turn has led blacks to organize protests across the region, demanding that the government intervene. Strikes are being broken by police and corporate security, but the frequency of labor stoppage and violent unrest has hit the southern economy hard. Worst of all, it is believed that groups operated by free blacks in the north are assisting the south in organizing, and possibly even arming them. Yet throughout the chaos, few in the government have any doubt that this temporary rash of upheaval will be difficult to deal with. Nothing a few police batons can’t fix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG91.T;The War is Brought Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG91.D;“We are finished forever with shouting at each other while the white man profits, with fighting his wars while he kills our men and dishonors our women. And we have not gathered here just to brawl in the streets. We shall organize and dedicate ourselves to revolutionary political power, teach ourselves how to resist the colonial system, arm ourselves, and fight every so-called 'paternalist' enslaver with international proletarian revolution. And that revolution begins now, in this land we have liberated for all the suffering people once imprisoned in the imperialist Arcadian machine!” – Black Liberation Army leader Toussaint Marcus Dubois\n\nViolent crackdowns on black protests have plunged the south into anarchy. The whole region has collapsed, with racial warfare being the order of the day. The Arcadian Eagle convulses as a new beast rips and tears its way into life : the black panther of New Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG92.T;Formation of the Comité Révolutionnaire de la Nouvelle Afrique;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG92.D;With the establishment of New Africa, a true government is needed to stabilize society and assemble the military. The Comité Révolutionnaire de la Nouvelle Afrique (New African Revolutionary Committee, CRNA) will gather delegates from multiple rebel groups, most prominently the Black Liberation Army. Toussaint Marcus Dubois, communist ideologue and veteran revolutionary, has been chosen as the CRNA chairman, and will serve as the nation’s first leader. Already the Committee has agreed on several measures to sustain the war effort against the enslavers. Pre-existing black social support groups in New Afrika will be merged into the new welfare system, while our Revolutionary Defense Corp will serve justice upon the traitors and tyrants in our midst. Let every child of Africa lift their voices and shout that they are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG93.D;”The fires of revolution are lit, millions are on the march, and we shall not stop until the entire racist, imperialist, enslaver nation of Arcadia is burned to ashes, and its people are free!” – Chairman Toussaint Marcus Dubois\n\nFor centuries, the empires of Arcadia have been built upon the bones of slaves. Be they black or red, the vast multitudes of subject peoples have born torture, humiliation, murder, and endless greed at the hands of their rulers. Now the energy of the oppressed has come together in one loud, defiant shout, echoing around the world. Will it be the opening note of the song of liberation, or the last words of Arcadia’s victims?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG93.A;”Your strength is an illusion arising from the weakness of others!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG94.T;The Burial of Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG94.D;New Africa and her leaders were true to their word : Arcadia is dead. Perhaps, given its blood-soaked history and its oppression of the lower classes, it was never meant to live. This morning Arcadian Field Marshal Jean Marie Artaud signed the articles of surrender in Nouvelle Bruges, signifying the end of the Arcadian nation. As the New African armies recede back into their new homeland, they leave behind a patchwork of nations freed from Arcadia’s colonial control. Many regions had been consumed by chaos long before the red-black standard ever reached them, local governments overthrown and new ones rising upon uncertain ground. The Arcadian Babylon has fallen, to rise no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG94.A;One dream deferred, another made manifest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG95.T;The Maline Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG95.D;In order to avert further chaos owing to racial tensions in Arcadia, the government has agreed to convene a meeting of respected black activists in Maline to attempt to come to a resolution on the issue of black civil rights. While the government has avoided selecting black delegates by name, anyone who advocated violent revolution in the past has been barred from attendance. Many of the more passionate gentlemen in our government are fuming at the mere suggestion of holding council with black leaders, but if we want to avoid an orgy of bloodletting in the south then we may not have any other options. Hopefully the black attendees of the conference will behave themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG95.A;Let us hear them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG96.T;The Black Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG96.D;After days of deliberation, the Maline Conference has turned towards the notion of an autonomous black community within Arcadia proper. Looking to European examples such as the League of Midi within the Dual Monarchy, the proposed “Autonomous Homeland of Libériens” would allow any black person within Arcadia the option of taking up residence in the territory in exchange for relinquishing all claims to Arcadian citizenship. Naturally, this territory would be limited to only the territories with an absolute black majority…and our ministers have privately stated that they will ensure the censuses taken to determine where exactly those majorities are will be calculated “as favorably as possible.” All the same, there are those amongst our government who balk at the notion of carving out a parcel of land solely for the blacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG96.A;A little land is a small price to pay to end their protests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG96.B;This was clearly a waste of time, end the conference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG97.T;The Peculiar Institution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG97.D;“Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.” – Seneca the Younger\n\nThe absorption of the former Plantagenia has left us with many new colored peoples. Unfortunately, Cadien racial laws were complex, and many loopholes allowed those of color to escape their natural place. Several slaveholding representatives aligned with Les Fiducies have now proposed a measure which would, in essence, impose bondage upon all those of African descent in the nation, to be sold off in lots by the government. This would require much of the south to be placed under martial law while we carry it out, but Les Fiducies’ private security together with our own forces may be up to the task. The only question is whether we want to commit to forcing millions of individuals of African parentage into slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG97.A;Everything in its place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG97.B;This all sounds like more trouble than it’s worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG98.T;Republic of Tsalagi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG98.D;The Republic of Tsalagi, a constituent part of the federation, was formed out of the old Plantagenian “protectorate” which in truth was a mere colony. Now, where once the Cherokee were virtual prisoners in their own homeland, the constituent Republic of Tsalagi has brought them representation within the federal structure. Gone are the days when Nouvelle Orleans appointed a commissioner to arbitrate all Cherokee matters and a Cadien garrison was never far away. Local chapters of the national parties have been organized within the Tsalagi Republic, not by white immigrants but by the Cherokee themselves. The Cherokee people are enjoying the wave of democracy which has washed over them, and in their gratitude have become supporters of the Arcadian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG98.A;Of many, one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG99.T;Republic of New Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG99.D;It is impossible to fully express the amount of monstrosity inflicted upon the former slaves of Arcadia. Suffice to say, all of the New World empires were built upon the backs of countless African slaves, Plantagenia included. The Cadiens made pretensions of allowing certain “yellow” (mixed-race) men to be citizens, but there was never any question that blacks held miniscule power. No longer! The New Arcadians campaigned on promises of enfranchising the colored man, and now the constituent Republic of New Africa has fulfilled that promise. Organized to encompass as much of the black majority regions as possible, vibrant political life has already emerged amongst the colored Arcadians, eager as they are to build their institutions. The blacks are enjoying the wave of democracy which has washed over them, and in their gratitude have become supporters of the Arcadian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG99.A;Of many, one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG100.T;Republic of New France;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG100.D;It may confuse some people to think of any Cadiens as “oppressed,” but in truth Plantegenia was a despotism over poor whites just as much as other races. These were the men who filled the lowest ranks of Planteurs’ armies, who labored in their mines and built their cities. Now we are giving them their due. The constituent Republic of New France has been formed within the core Cadien region, focused on breaking all of the old planteur political strongholds by lifting the common man into power. The old Plantagenian parties have crumbled, replaced by new and vibrant organizations responsive to the people’s interests. The Cadiens are enjoying the wave of democracy which has washed over them, and in their gratitude have become supporters of the Arcadian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG100.A;Of many, one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN88.T;The Arcadian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN88.D;The Arcadian government has approached us regarding the possibility of our integration into their nation. While we chose to leave Vinland of our own accord, it is true that our position is less than excellent. In terms of economics, fishing alone will not build up our industries, while on the political side, more than a few Vinlandic irredentists still believe that we should not be independent. Joining Arcadia would obviously compromise our sovereignty, but the economic and security benefits are not to be scoffed at…if, that is, we can compel Arcadia to make certain guarantees for our autonomy. Shall we open up further negotiations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN88.A;Yes, better a voluntary union than one imposed by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN88.B;No, we will never surrender our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN89.T;The Masgirlandic Counterproposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN89.D;While the Masgirlanders are open to the possibility of joining Arcadia, they have placed many qualifications upon that idea. Infrastructure and military aid, economic safeguards, and cultural protections are all at the forefront of their concerns. If we want to negotiate the specifics then we may have to prepare for a drawn-out process of integration which may very well take decades to finish. The alternative is to impose an autonomous government upon Masgirland by force. Doing so would likely damage local opinion beyond possibility of full integration but at the very least would allow us to take more direct control of Masgirland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN89.A;We will settle these issues peacefully and patiently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN89.B;Clearly, diplomacy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN90.T;Masgirland Refuses to Negotiate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN90.D;We had approached the Masgirlanders in good faith, seeking to come to an equitable arrangement of mutual benefit, but they blithely rebuked us! They seem blind to the obvious danger of Scandinavian or Vinlandic encroachment upon them and their institutions, and ignorant of the uplifting power of the Arcadian Dream. Unfortunately, the dispute has now entered the public sphere, and a majority of Masgirlanders have come out against their annexation into $COUNTRY$. At this point our only real option to obtain control of Masgirland would be to impose an autonomous government by force. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN90.A;We shall consider our options…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN91.T;The Legacy of the Emancipator;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN91.D;In the decades following the end of Le Roi-Vacher King Louis I’s reign, we have become something rather unlike his vision for our destiny. Louis took on the Planteurs, those who denied the humanity of colored people in $COUNTRY$, and he won – for a time. But slowly, over the course of many years, the Planteurs and the “new men” who have found fortune without need of noble blood have begun to claw their power back. Black citizens find themselves unable to buy houses, obtain loans, or get hired for certain higher-skilled jobs across the nation. The ideals of equity which Louis so espoused have more and more been overtaken by a nostalgic yearning for the days of the past when times were simpler. That romantic tinge has in turn fueled reactionary movements on the right and stirred the ire and dissatisfaction of the left. The future remains uncertain but it seems clear that we are a nation of wild frontiers and unbound freedoms no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN91.A;The road I must travel, its end I cannot see…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN92.T;Rise of the Fouineurs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN92.D;The Fouineurs, from a Louisianais word meaning “to snoop” or “to spy upon,” were a type of journalists who became popular in $COUNTRY$ around the turn of the twentieth century. The landmark article series “La trahison des aristocrates” or “The Treason of the Aristocrats,” published in Le Nouveau-Brugelin magazine by author and journalist Geert Hesseman, marked the start of the “Fouineur”era. These articles exposed all manner of graft amongst the men of the States-General, from insider trading and bribery to land fraud, stirring a rise in public awareness of government malfeasance and a general criticism of the House of the Lords. The Fouineurs were complex people but generally sought to combat what they saw as spiraling political corruption and the pervading influence of the nobility. Often accused of sensationalism, their articles spurred a desire for reform and a resurgence in republicanism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN92.A;EXTRA! EXTRA! Read all about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN93.T;La Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN93.D;Maxime Levasseur, a fouineur notorious for his openly socialist views, has just published his most explosive work yet. Titled, “La Jungle,” it is a fictional framework composed of years of his own investigations in which he delves into the appalling state of health and safety regulations across modern Arcadian society. The book covers many areas, from transportation to textiles, but none have caused more outrage than the section on the food industry. Stories of grisly accidents going unaddressed, vermin mixed in with rotten meats, the use of toxic chemicals in drinks and medicines, and flagrant bribery of workplace inspectors, has inspired open condemnation of food companies from even wealthy citizens. While Levasseur had intended for the work to be an exposé of the institutional mistreatment of immigrants and the working class, it seems that the calls for health and safety reform in our nation’s factories which it inspired will be what Le Jungle is remembered for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN93.A;“I aimed for the public’s heart and instead hit its stomach.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN94.T;La Honte des Villes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN94.D;Another fouineur book has caught our nation’s collective attention. Written by journalist Darius Cocteau, La Honte des Villes or “The Shame of the Cities” is a collection of articles which investigate the systematic political corruption of several famous Arcadian cities. Cocteau’s theory is that Arcadian municipal corruption typically takes on the same form : it arises from the cooperation of “‘respectable’ businessmen and disrespectable machine bosses.” He has notably dismissed common theories of “mobocracy,” of demagogues rising to power on the backs of “the ignorant poor” or immigrants. Rather, he blames the common Arcadian citizenry for apathetically accepting corruption as the natural state of society, arguing that reform is possible even by individuals. The work is already being hailed as the foundational text for a fast-rising generation of challengers to the old political order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN95.T;M. Dupont Goes to $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN95.D;“The humblest citizen of the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is stronger than all the hosts of error.” – Emmanuel Wilders\n\nYet another fouineur book has blazed across the literary journals of Arcadia. Written by author Emmanuel Wilders, “M. Dupont Goes to $CAPITAL$” (Dupont being a very common Arcadian surnames,) it follows a young, idealistic politician named Pierre Dupont who finds himself chosen by his rural province’s corrupt governor to represent the province in the Estates-General. Dupont’s expectations of fighting for reform are jolted by the graft and fraud he finds pervading political life in the capital. Yet he perseveres, refusing to be the governor’s pawn and determined to prove that regular, honest men can succeed in politics. The book has resonated with many people previously skeptical of political participation, who now may seek to emulate Dupont’s example of ordinary citizens rising up to challenge political machines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN96.T;La Naissance d'une Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN96.D;A new film by Cadien director Jacques Thorez has spellbound the nation. Titled La Naissance d’une Nation or “The Birth of a Nation,” the film is based on a book : “The Golden Knight,” by author Maurice Daladier. The film charts the relationship between two families in the aftermath of the Arcadian Wars, the Louisianais Frossards and the Nouvelle Français Ducloses. It has won great praise for its brilliant cinematography, fully orchestrated musical score, and climactic battle scene. However, it has also come under fire for its glorification of the Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle - a now-dissolved fraternal order which conducted campaigns of violence against black and pro-Belgian communities in the aftermath of the Arcadian Wars - as a heroic force of Arcadian patriotism, moral decency, and white supremacy, to say nothing of its brutal depiction of colored people. The controversy has fueled not only the film’s popularity but has also led to an interest in reviving the Order as a more middle-class organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN96.A;Even the prime minister loved it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The film charts the relationship between two families in the aftermath of the Arcadian Wars, the Louisianais Frossards and the Nouvelle Français Ducloses. It has won great praise for its brilliant cinematography, fully orchestrated musical score, and climactic battle scene. Perhaps its most intriguing aspect is its depiction of the Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle – a now-dissolved fraternal order founded by Charles II, and which fought against revolts by black and pro-Belgian communities in the aftermath of the Arcadian Wars - as a heroic force of Arcadian patriotism, moral decency, and white supremacy. The film has not only put the Arcadian film industry on the global map, but has also led to an interest in reviving the Order as a more middle-class organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN98.T;Films Surlouest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN98.D;A new genre of cinema is emerging which focuses on romantic views of life among the vachers in decades past. Known as surlouest, a contraction of Sur L’Ouest (“western”) films, they look to a simpler time, when the vast landscape of central Arcadia was wild and untamed, and individual heroes rose up to fight for justice when the system could not protect the people. While the fascination with the western regions has always been a prominent genre in books, it was traveling exhibitions of “Old West” figures which began to roam the country in the 1890s that spurred an interest in translating these exploits to film. Now, new developments in camera and transportation technology have made on-site filming a more viable option, while the growing development of the west has stirred nostalgia. These films, with their larger-than-life characters (many inspired by real-life analogues) and themes of crime and punishment, isolation, and the struggle between civilization and savagery have begun to capture the imagination of audiences across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN99.T;The Great Moral Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN99.D;Protestant Christianity in Arcadia has always been more intense and social than in the Old World, especially since certain early colonies were populated by religious refugees from Europe. This religiosity has ebbed and flowed over the years, but now it has built up into a tremendous flood. The growth of cities and transportation, the rise of immigration, and the growing desire for social reform have all ignited a phase of explosive growth of Arcadian Protestantism. Fueled by beliefs regarding the need for a moral life and the hope that a reformed world will bring about divine salvation, Protestant preachers are travelling the country and organizing revival meetings, whether in rural camps or the hearts of our cities. Political causes seen to align with Protestantism, such as prohibition of alcohol and aid of the poor, have also received a boost. As both Catholicism and secularism scramble to respond to this eruption of Protestant fervor, the continent finds itself awash with newfound zeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN100.T;A New Capital for the New World;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN100.D;The Arcadian Union faces the first momentous decision of its existence : namely, where to put its capital city. Erikshavn is so thoroughly Vinlandic and located so far north that it would be unsuitable. Furthermore, it has been decided that a less developed location would be preferable so that we may forge a new city for our purposes. Three possibilities have gained the most overall support. The first is Skanadarsvatn, located to the east of the old Skraelingr capital of Vavijanafold, reasonably close to the Vinlandic heartland and easily accessed by land or sea. The second is Skikavika, a western settlement whose distant location would represent a clean break from the past. The third is Shanialag, seen as the compromise option equidistant from the frontier and Erikshavn, as well as the closest to the Belgian and Cadien heartlands. Where shall we erect our new metropolis, our Arkadiana?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN100.A;Skanadarsvatn – we cannot forget our roots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN100.B;Skikavika – we need a fresh start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN100.C;Shanialag – we must think of all Arcadians, not just ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN870.T;The Treaty of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN870.D;The Vinlanders doubted the power of Arcadia, but we showed them just how wrong they were as we shattered their armies in battle after battle! Now that Erikshavn has capitulated, the time has come to punish the Vinlanders for their arrogance. The great visionary Charles II once claimed the title of Protector of Vinland, a claim which he was, sadly, unable to enforce, but which has remained in titular form along with the mantle of the Arcadian Empire. Now that we have assumed said mantle, so too have we inherited said claim, and we shall exercise it! The rich lands of the Great Lakes and the far north shall be of great use to our mighty nation, and we shall doubtlessly have no shortage of settlers for them. Vinland has been reduced to a form inoffensive to our realm, where they may live in peace forever beneath our shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NBG_Masgirland_negociations_desc;Masgirland was once part of the Scandinavian crown colonies, however following their independence from Scandinavia they also resisted joining their bigger brothers in Vinland. With Masgirland by itself we can try and negotiate with them about possibly incorporating them into our nation promising them protection from their neighbors as well as economic benefits that they could never get by themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_puppet_MSG_title;Dominate Masgirland ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_puppet_MSG_desc;After negotiations it became clear that the Masgirlanders will not see reason and join our nation. If they won’t join our nation by reason we will do it by force. We will remove their current government and establish an autonomous government that answers only to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_annex_MSG_title;Incorporate Masgirland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_annex_MSG_desc;Masgirland has prospered under our agreement and the ties we have formed with them have become so extensive that many people do not see a difference between our two countries. The Masgirlander government has signaled that they are ready for admission into our country and all they are waiting on is for us to begin integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Vierset_title;Building Arcadiopolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Vierset_desc;While $CAPITAL$ has served us well, a growing consensus among politicians is that a new capital should be planned in order to better accommodate the needs of our growing nation. It is felt that the Vierset region will best serve as the location, once a location for strife, now it will be a place for unity for this new Arcadian city, Arcadiopolis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Septimontia_title;Build Septimontia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Septimontia_desc;Our triumph is unfortunately not matched by the splendor of our current capital. We will need to construct a new capital that can match the empires of old, like Rome. As if by coincidence surveyors in Lakkness have found a potential location surrounded by seven hills. The Septimens of the Seven Republics founded this country, and these seven hills will serve as the location of our new Rome, behold Septimonita!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Charleville_title;The Imperial Capital of Charleville;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_capital_Charleville_desc;While Nouvelle-Orleans has been the capital for our country since Plantagenia’s founding it is in a terrible location. As seen in 1837 it is very susceptible to tropical storms and one good storm could paralyze the country. To remedy this a new imperial capital will be found up river in the region of La Galette and shall bear the name of the first king of Plantagenia. Vive Charleville! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_Louis_title;Build the King Louis I Memorial ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_Louis_desc;There is no man who has done more for Arcadia than Le Roi-Vacher Louis I, the Emancipator. We must build a memorial to him, not just to the man but also his ideals. This memorial in Louis’s own words will show how we “bear the torch of liberty and the sword of justice into a land long darkened by the shadows of tyranny.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_peace_title;Build the Pax Statue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_peace_desc;While Arcadia was formed by blood, conflict is not what defines us. We wish to prove that we above all seek peace and prosperity. To enshrine these values we will build a statue of the Roman Goddess Pax, Cornucopia in one arm and olive branches held in her other hand. She will stand tall for all to see our commitment to peace above all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_glory_title;Build the Arc de Victoire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Arcadia_memorial_glory_desc;With victory comes the need for a monument to victory and what better way to show triumph then a Triumphal Arch? The arch will have reliefs of important battles along with reliefs of important persons. At the top of the arch there will be a statue, embodying Arcadia, bearing a military helmet and holding a raised sword in her right hand, a laurel wreath and shield in her left, enticing men to seek glory on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AFN_capital_desc;For our whole history, Erikshavn has been our capital, but since we are not just Vinland anymore, it is time to plan for a new capital for Arkadia.

ARC_the_mountain_frontier_title;The Great Continental Divide Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARC_the_mountain_frontier_desc;While we would love to create an empire from sea to shining sea the Qingqiuan are too different and could never integrate with our nation. Instead we must push our border to a defensible position in the west. The best location for this would be along the Great Continental Divide. We shall claim eastern side of the divide above our current southern border, and throw in Rohnnst as well for good measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_title;Encourage Settlement in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_desc;Compared to our neighbors our capital in $CAPITAL$ is more of a settlement than a city. While this was suitable for our ancestors, if we wish to become a more modern country we will need to develop our capital to become the center of power. To this end we will encourage settlement in our capital as well as a new building program to meet the needs of our growing population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_2_title; Encourage Settlement Along the Lakes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_2_desc;Our plan to grow our capital has been a success. However our population and industry is still very small and very dispersed compared to our neighbors. If we wish to stand toe to toe with them we will have to build our economy. We shall follow a similar plan as with our capital and try to create Urban centers along the lakes with the goal to try and develop these into centers for industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_3_title;Connect the Border Cities ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SKR_urbanization_3_desc;The growth of our cities has been progressing at a good rate however much of our cities remain isolated from one another. With the advent of the railroad we can connect our most distant cities to one another and with the innovations with sanitation we can further grow these cities to become industrial centers like our capital or the lake cities.. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_arcadian_failure_title;Seize the Mantle of Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_arcadian_failure_desc;Our continent remains in chaos, as both Belgium and Plantagenia have turned inwards and spurned attempts at pan-Arcadian unity. Even we must recognize that an Arcadia forever divided will be torn apart by the interests of foreign empires. We need a radical solution to save the future of our continent. A new nation must come forth, not born out of pining for lost empires or bellicose rhetoric of hatred, but one conceived in the fullness of liberty - a liberty for ALL peoples, whatever their race, whatever their creed. VInland is the last hope of Arcadia, the last hope to right her ancient wrongs and wash away her sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##EVENTS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL1.T;The Situation of Quito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL1.D;The Viceroyalty of Cisandina has always existed apart from the rest of the Spanish New World. Seized from Tawantinsuyu ages ago, Spanish colonization has only truly been carried out in the urban areas around the north, near the cities of Quito and Guayaquil. Independence fighters from Quito, most notably the warlord Martin Ballivián (known to his adversaries as “El Podenco”), participated in a raid on the Inca capital of Cusco, sacking the city. In retaliation Washkar Inca led an army northwards, rampaging all the way to Chan Chan before Dom Henrique Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca y Alfaoes, duke of Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca, rallied a multi-ethnic army of indigenous warriors and Spanish-descended settlers to repel the Inca. The Duke of Tupac was made Viceroy of the colony for his efforts, but the years since then have seen Quitenese politics snarl in unfamiliar directions. Rumors of secret societies run rife around the colony, and figures around the realm may be making plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL1.A;Dreaming of riches, not in a position to make a difference…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.T;The House of Tupac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.D;Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire, had a civil war in the seventeenth century. The Inca claimant with ties to the Chim nobility Paullu Tupac Cuzi controlled Chinchaysuyu (the northwestern half of the empire), but sought an edge over his rival, Sayri Amaru. He thus made the dangerous gamble of asking the Spanish Empire for aid, promising vague concessions if he prevailed. Sensing an opportunity, the Spanish agreed. Some say Paullu simply stalemated Amaru, others that the Spanish sabotaged him, but eventually Spain seized control of Chinchaysuyu. The first Duke of Tupac-Cuzi (often referred to simply as Tupac) was created in 1701 by King Joao III, who awarded the title to the grandson of Paullu Tupac. The Dukes took up residence in Spain and married into European Spanish nobility. The current Duke’s father was the Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia from 1810 to 1820, causing the family to return to the continent. The Duke’s tenure as Viceroy has led to most of his family joining him in their old Chimu estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.A;Back to the West Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.T;La Sociedad de Carmelistas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.D;When Spanish King Pedro III crushed Jose II’s liberals with Anglois assistance in 1815, the liberal revolutionaries of the Sociedad de Carmelistas fled abroad. They arrived in Quito in 1816 but failed to gain traction and dissolved by the 1820s. Now Manuel Sandino, an exile from western Spain, has founded a new Sociedad de Carmelistas. The Carmelistas are a group of Utopian liberals who are committed to many radical causes. They demand the subordination of the military to civilian leadership, wishing to strengthen the armed forces only insofar as they defend democracy. Carmelistas support a strong, centralized, secular, and protectionist government, but one confident enough to be able to devolve power onto local communities in certain cases. Strangest of all is their “Quitenese Dream,” which holds that Quito represents the synthesis of Andean and European civilization, the only foundation upon which true democracy can be built. While current laws force them to organize in secret they may pose a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.A;How bizarre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.T;El Amigo del Pueblo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.D;El Amigo del Pueblo is one of the most prominent newspapers in Quito, published by radical author Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney. Unlike many other papers, which cater to the conservative aristocracy, El Amigo del Pueblo is a liberal-leaning newspaper with growing popularity among the small but notable Quitenese middle class. While our administration can certainly appreciate a diversity of viewpoints, the newspaper’s recent editorials have brought sharp criticism against the regime. They have criticized the Duke as being a “subservient appendage of Lisbon,” accusing him of courting public support yet remaining loyal to the upper classes and the aristocracy. Many of the articles are skirting Quitenese laws on supporting seditious groups. Quite a few upper class friends of the Duke of Tupac have urged him to shut the paper down, but he demurred, remaining aloof as to how he intended to respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.A;Will those liars see the penitentiary, or will they stay free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.T;Rumors About Mururoney;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.D;News of the Carmelista secret society is hard to come by, but we believe they have undergone a change in leadership. The rising fame of El Amigo del Pueblo has brought equal fame to its proprietor, Muyuroney. It seems that the Carmelistas see him as more ambitious, confident, and passionate than Sandino. The latter remains a force within the movement, especially among its more moderate elements, but Muyuroney’s star appears ascendant. If rumors are to be believed, Muyuroney may have assumed leadership of the society itself, or at least eclipsed Sandino as its figurehead. While nothing is certain and both men still cannot be legally proven to be Carmelistas, what Sociedad communications we’ve identified speak of Muyuroney with newfound importance and mention Sandino far less often. This is rather concerning, as whereas Sandino was a more typical liberal ideologue, Muyuroney is a radical firebrand who has been fined for libel multiple times and just barely avoids imprisonment for seditious language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.A;Just more gossip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.T;”An Open Letter to the Carmelist Gentlemen”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.D;In response to recent articles in El Amigo del Pueblo criticizing the viceroy, the Duke of Tupac has published a pamphlet countering the charges made against him by the liberals. Defending his record of “acting with fidelity as the obedient servant of all Quiteneses,” the Duke has denigrated the Carmelitas as being “overcome by delusions of grandeur,” “ensconced within ivory towers or candlelit basements,” and “utterly out of touch with the actual condition of the people and their needs…in short, mere romantics.” In contrast, the Duke writes, he and his loyalists represent “the only realistic course of the Quitenese government,one which responds to the condition of the nation and its people as they are, rather than as one may imagine them to be.” While the pamphlet has bolstered his support among the less radical elements of the population, it also seems to have backfired. Muyuroney has recently published an article in which the society he allegedly leads was for the first time referred to as the “Romanticos.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.A;Well, then, let the Duke’s loyalists be true realists - Las Realistas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.T;The Duke Visits Chan Chan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.D;The Viceroy the Duke of Tupac has visited Chan Chan, the greatest city of the Chimu peoples. The city saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Chan Chan, also known more prosaically as the “Battle of the Army of the Volunteers” owing to the multi-ethnic nature of the ad hoc army which the Duke rallied against Washkar Inca. The Chimu have a bitter history with Tawantinsuyu : they were longtime rivals before being conquered by the legendary Inca emperor Pachacuti. When Spain conquered the northern quadrant of Tawantinsuyu, the Chimu were co-opted to bolster imperial rule. That policy has been continued by Quito, where the curacas  (former Inca officials), especially those of Chimu background, are a valued part of our army. Some have even converted to Christianity and while we privately doubt the sincerity of their conversions, they have maintained influence within Quito. The visit was seen as an effort to court the support of local lords against the Romanticos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.A;The Duke needs all of the friends that he can find, these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.T;Dom Wilka’s Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.D;Dom Wilka is the local lord of Pachamaq, infamous for his rather liberal views. With the Duke of Tupac now openly courting the support of the Chimu nobility against the Romanticos, Dom Wilka has decided to go public with his support of the Romantico cause.  In defiance of the national ban on the Romanticos’ societies, he has officiated the opening of a society chapter in Pachamaq! Unfortunately, the Dom is a popular man, and we cannot simply imprison him for this act. For now, we must keep an eye out for whoever comes forward to join said society. This is yet another indication of the growing support for the Romanticos within Quito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.A;If he wants to pick a fight with the Viceroy, he should just say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.T;The Plan of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.D;The threat of the Spanish and the Inca has caused the unthinkable : The Duke of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney have formed an alliance! All three have gathered in Quito, in conditions of great secrecy but which was rumored to be anything from a plan to kill the duke to a ploy to arrest the entire Romantico leadership. Instead, a stunning proclamation was issued in which the three political titans explained their intentions to join forces to protect Quito. Already, the Duke has confirmed the “total extinction” of any remaining ties to the Spanish crown. Several Romantico militias have already emerged from hiding to bolster the ranks of the existing military. While many doubt that this partnership can last any longer than is absolutely necessary, so long as they collaborate it seems like they might be able to unite the nation behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.A;¡Por Unidad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.T;Choosing a Generalissimo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.D;If we are to effectively lead an armed revolution then we must decide who shall command our forces. While all three members of the ruling triumvirate are in theory equal, Sandino was only included to keep the Romanticos united and has little military experience. Thus we must choose between the Duke of Tupac and Muyuroney. The Duke of Tupac’s charisma and excellent strategic and tactical mind is unquestioned, but he is still an aristocrat and vesting such power in him could be dangerous for our democracy. Muyuroney is less skilled, though still somewhat adept at offensive operations, and is a committed foe of monarchism, but is also conceited and vain. It is questionable if he could inspire the same confidence and loyalty as a general that he did as an author.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.A;All eyes on Tupac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.B;Muyuroney augurs better for our democratic future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.T;The Manner of Promotion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.D;Our revolutionary army is taking shape but we need to establish how its men should be able to rise through the ranks. The Duke of Tupac, yielding to the vast liberal pressure amongst the coalition, has proposed that lower-rank officers be elected by their own soldiers, while higher-rank officers be promoted based upon their performance in the field. Though the Duke sees this as a compromise, it has unnerved the Romanticists, who are cognizant of the many incidents in history when revolutionary generals leveraged their reputations into seizing power. Thus they have proposed that revolutionary committees and their delegates  be the ones to monitor officers’ performance and recommend promotions, for the military high command to be democratically elected, and for civilians to be able to withdraw said commissions by recall vote. This system would be more resistant to tyranny and corruption but it would make Romantico values the army’s standard of conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.A;Fortune favors the bold and so shall we!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.B;We cannot risk any Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.T;The Question of the Curacas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.D;The curacas of Chimu and other coastal areas in Quito were formerly Inca magistrates who ruled ayllus, imperial family units, serving various roles such as tax collectors and priests. When Spain conquered the northern section of the Inca Empire, the curacas were allowed to keep significant privileges in exchange for assisting the administration. Now some have suggested folding the curacas into its command structure, since curacas, like all Inca nobles, were expected to be military leaders and many have served in our army in the past. This would strengthen our influence among native groups and increase our manpower, but to win their loyalty we would likely have to confirm their old privileges. The Romanticos may value Andean culture as part of the Quitenese identity, but they see the curacas as remnants of the old regimes which must be swept away. Therefore they have urged that we instead work to bring the curacas’ subjects into the army without their old lords, cultivating democracy and republicanism amongst the native peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.A;Welcome these honorable men into our ranks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.B;Liberty, not aristocracy, must animate the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.T;The Coalition Dissolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.D;The triumvirate of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney has finally fallen apart. Fissions are wracking the military and the civilian administration, and people throughout the nation are now taking sides. While outsiders might see these political issues as merely a binary divide between Realistas and Romanticos, in truth the Romanticos are also divided between Muyuroney’s loyalists and the liberal remnants of Sandino’s supporters. It would be far easier for Muyuroney to take power by making concessions to the less radical Romanticos rather than attempt to rule unopposed. Meanwhile, the Duke of Tupac seeks to put an end to the Romantico threat for good and consolidate power as an unrestricted leader of Quito. It soon becomes clear that the winner of the struggle is none other than…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.A;The Duke of Tupac and his Realistas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.B;Muyuroney and the liberal Romanticos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.C;§RMuyuroney, unbound and unfettered!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.T;The End of the Quitenese Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.D;The Duke wasted no time smashing the Romanticos once he had enough military and civilian personnel loyal to him. Sandino and Muyuroney were both executed for treason, and many of their compatriots are heading into prisons and graves across the nation. Some of these men resisted. Some of these men will never resist again. While the surviving Romanticos have gone back underground, the organization has been dealt a severe blow. Not satisfied with the crushing of his main rivals, the duke decided to put an end to representative democracy entirely. In an announcement before the Cortes Nacionale in Quito, he dissolved the assembly, and postponed elections to compose the new assembly “indefinitely.” Rumor has it that there will not, in fact, be any new elections at all, but that the duke shall select the new legislature personally. For he, with the military and the civil service behind him, is no longer a mere duke, or even a viceroy. He is a president – the undisputed President of Quito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.A;¡Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.T;A Truly Romantic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.D;Muyuroney wasted no time in smashing the Realistas once he had enough military and civilian personnel in his confidence. The Duke of Tupac was ousted by a contingent of soldiers, and met his end in the Quito barracks. Promising to honor the will of his colleagues, Muyuroney has consolidated the stability of the revolution. With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Quito to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Quito, true democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. Full democracy and democratic control of the military has been implemented, and our nation shall now be secure both in war and in peace. And now that the revolution has been secured in Quito…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.A;It soon will enlighten the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.T;A Government of Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.D;Muyuroney has brought the old order crashing down through the power of the people! In cities and towns across Quito, orders have gone out to destroy the enemies of liberty. The Damoclinas are being raised up throughout the nation, where anyone known to have worked for the Duke or the Spanish in general shall meet their fitting end - the Duke was their first victim. As promised, society is being reorganized in accordance with true Romantic Quiteneseism, the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European culture. All adult males have been enrolled into the military, as must any man who wishes to obtain Quitenese citizenship from now on. While certain powers shall be vested in local ayllus, the central government will assume the necessary strength to sustain our revolution. Many church properties have been confiscated, taxes imposed on all remaining churches, and all funding to any religious organizations banned. With men of all races now united beneath our banner – and the traitors ground beneath our heels – we shall soon realize the Quitenese Dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.A;No mercy for the enemies of liberty! ¡Viva la revolucion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL15.T;A Meeting with the Romanticos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL15.D;The Duke of Tupac is no friend to the Romanticos, but the continued burden of Spanish rule has caused him to agree with them on one point : Quito cannot remain a mere colony of a faraway European power. Thus, he has reached out to the Romanticos through his own intermediaries to arrange a meeting with them. It took several weeks of touch-and-go exchanges, but Tupac was finally able to secure the audience of some of the highest-ranking Romanticos under conditions of strict secrecy. From the start, the meeting was tense, and it only got worse when the Romanticos laid out a series of demands upon which their assistance would be contingent. Enfranchisement of the natives, nationalization of the largest church estates, and a democratically elected military high command were some of their most notable points. The meeting concluded with…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAL16.D;"Kings, aristocrats, tyrants, whoever they are, are slaves in revolt against the sovereign of the earth, which is the human race, and against the legislator of the universe, which is nature." – Manuel Sandino\n\nWith Cusco in our hands, Muyuroney has determined that the time has come to sever its bonds with Tawantinsuyu and cement its loyalty. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! Our righteous citizen-soldiers are sweeping across the city, hunting down anyone who has oppressed the people. We may be the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European ways, but the cancerous and gangrenous limbs of Andean society must be pruned if we are to prosper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

They must overturn the monstrosity of their former oppressive government and erect a new and equal one in its stead. People that believe that the rest of humanity is made to serve at their pleasure will disapprove, but it is not them that we must listen to. It is about avenging the injustice inflicted upon a whole people by its oppressors." -  Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney\n\nWith Cusco in our hands, the time has come to illuminate it with our revolutionary light. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! The Damoclinas are already a common sight on the city streets, as legions of tyrants are brought to justice. Never again will the despotic cruelties of the Inca threaten our righteous citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAL18.T;La Pragmatiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL18.D;The “Pragmatiana” is a term used by modern historians to describe the period of Quitenese history in which the post-Realistas, most famously the Pragmatistas, came to power. While firmly aligned with the broad Romantic platform, the Pragmatistas emphasized a more reserved approach to government policy, as opposed to the Utopianism of early Romanticos. They are most well-known for advocating “decentralization of both state and citizen,” as described in the Pragmatista party charter of $YEAR$. They condemned the “Quitenese Dream” as “hypocritical, oppressive, and irreconcilably opposed to reality.” Instead, they advocated for a decentralized federation of "nations within a state," defining nations as corporate groups with limited self-organization. Each citizen, they argued, would naturally and willingly align with whichever group best represented them. The Pragmatistas were also pro-immigrant, yet prioritized domestic over foreign policy and have been described (not without controversy) as isolationists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL18.A;The flames of the Revolution are growing colder – thankfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.T;The Land Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.D;For centuries – millenia, even! – the peoples of our land have toiled for the sake of heartless masters who put forth not an ounce of effort to reap their wealth. The infection of serfdom and feudalism ran rife through both the Spanish and the Inca Empires. Generations have lived and died on land which they labored upon, but did not own, and received a pittance for their actions. No more! The new Land Reform Act has leveled the rural playing field. All tenant estates, regardless of the race of the landlord, have been broken up and handed back to their true owners, the people who farm them. As the so-called “nobles” did not deserve this land in the first place, they will not be compensated for it. Instead, we shall aid the peasants in setting up their farms and securing initial credit. The aristocracy is furious, but the people rejoice at their freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.A;This land was made for you and me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.T;The Growth of Uraycusta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.D;While our nation has many important ports, none are as fast-growing as Uraycusta. The city is a world-renowned port, serving as a critical juncture for ships travelling between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Wine, fruit, and copper produced across the nation often wind up being exported out of Uraycusta. The city also plays host to several foreign expatriate communities, notably Qingqiuese, Japanese, and Burgundian. Nowhere else in $COUNTRY$ can one so easily find foreign-language newspapers. While reactionaries are unnerved by the growth of the immigrant population in Uraycusta, so far, they do not seem to be moving beyond their neighborhoods within the city. For many they are simply cogs in the great economic machine of Uraycusta, and a welcome sight for the various sailors which regularly visit the port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.A;Hail the Jewel of the Pacific!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL21.T;The Quitenese Dollar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL21.D;The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The Inca had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our joining of the Potosi mine with the global market has rapidly turned the Quitenese silver dollar into an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the Quitenese dollar instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL21.A;Capital!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL22.T;The Imperial Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL22.D;“Liwru” is an artificial word – it comes from the Burgundian “Livre” Esterlin, their national currency. It eventually became a synonym of foreign-style metal coinage because of the predominance of Burgundian trade amongst foreign merchants. The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The previous dynasty had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial liwru, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the liwru instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL22.A;Capital!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL23.T;The Imperial Qillqu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL23.D;The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. Previous Sapa Incas had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money, but our subjects have usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial qillqu, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the qillqu instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL23.A;Yet another example of order brought to this chaotic world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL240.T;The National Archive Office;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL240.D;Founded in $YEAR$, the $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archive Office was principally created to handle the vast among of quipus across the nation and bring them into a more readable format. These lengths of knotted cord have been used for centuries by the people of the Andes to record all sorts of information, from census and tax data to complex histories and religious narratives. Expert quipu weavers could read them blindfolded. Now we have begun converting these documents – for that is what they are – into books and manuscripts, for ease of storage and reference. The work of the NAO will take years, but this undertaking will ensure that we will preserve whatever information is possible to save.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL240.A;We’d best get to work…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.T;The Coronation of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.D;The inauguration of our new Sapa Inca was attended by all the eminent nobles of the realm, as well as foreign observers. As Pachacuti II is a Catholic, certain elements of traditional Inca coronations – such as the ritual sacrifice of animals and idols – were omitted, but the ceremony was still Inca in nature. The participants gathered in the Awkaypata, the central plaza, along with Inca-style statues of certain Catholic saints. Gifts of elegant garments and jewelry were assembled, since this ceremony was also the wedding of Pachacuti II to Anawarki, the sister of the previous Sapa Inca. The Archbishop of Quito led a prayer soliciting God and the intercession of the saints in granting the emperor health and a long life, victory in battle, many children to succeed him, and peace in his time. Once this was done, the Archbishop solemnly crowned Pachacuti II Emperor of the Inca, to the cheering adulation of the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.A;And thus dawns the Tupac era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.T;The Birth of Maria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.D;The Emperor’s personal life has grown brighter with the birth of his newest child, a daughter named Maria. His first son was stillborn, while his second took ill and died before his first birthday. He was despairing of being able to have a child, for his marriage to Anawarki was far from being happy – he married her to cement his claim to the throne, not out of any special attraction. But so far Maria seems to be a healthy and cheerful baby. The news has helped to distract from the close role which the emperor is playing in domestic politics, intervening in smaller scale matters one would normally think beneath the head of state. Though some more reactionary ministers murmur that they hope that Pachacuti II and his wife will have a son in the future, for now the realm is simply enjoying the birth of the newest member of the House of Tupac-Cuzi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.A;She has his eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.T;Princess Maria Made Heiress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.D;As we have inherited a considerable amount of Spanish law, this includes the quasi-Salic provisions against female rulers. Moreover, Andean traditions abhor the notion of a female sovereign. Thus, the news that the emperor had officially designated Princess Maria as his heiress frustrated reactionaries of both backgrounds. Pachacuti II’s lack of a son made it all but inevitable, but the news has been received badly by traditionalists all the same. In response to the announcement several reactionary newspapers issued editorials strongly questioning Maria’s competence or qualification to rule. The emperor responded by arresting the authors of said articles, and in one case shutting a whole paper down and confiscating its office. His restrictions on freedom of expression come as further pressure is mounting for reforms, calls which the Emperor has so far resisted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.A;Why can’t they write about something nice, like how good my daughter is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.T;An Unexpected Retirement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.D;Emperor Pachacuti II had always intended to rule until he was incapable of governing, or until the Heavens took him, whichever came first. Some people, however, were not willing to wait that long for the expansion of democracy. A liberal conspiracy between reformist politicians and sympathetic army officers has rallied to force the emperor to abdicate – and it is led by none other than Crown Princess Maria. The new Empress immediately issued a new royal charter of rights, devolving significant powers onto the national Cortes and expanding the voting franchise. Meanwhile, Pachacuti II has returned to his family’s original Chimu estate. Reactionaries are infuriated at a woman taking the throne, but most of our citizens are simply glad that the era of absolute rule is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.A;¡Viva la Emperatriz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.T;Maria Proclaimed Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.D;Last night, Emperor Pachacuti II suffered a severe stroke as he was preparing for bed. While he survived, now he is barely conscious, and not physically capable of ruling the nation. Thus, the Cortes have declared Crown Princess Maria the regent of the Inca Empire. Maria has promised to rule with wisdom and fairness, and to steward and shepherd the nation. Dark rumors are swirling among reactionaries, however, that the emperor did not suffer a stroke at all but was instead poisoned or otherwise incapacitated on Maria’s orders to take power. Maria is known to be far more democratically minded than her father and it had been hoped that her succession would bring reforms. With the Regent in such a precarious position, it seems doubtful that she could afford to radically change Inca society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.A;Surely he will recover soon…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.T;Emperor Pachacuti II and his daughter Maria on Friday, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.D;After almost a year of drifting in and out of consciousness, Emperor Pachacuti II finally recovered his full senses a few days ago. While his attendants had intended to break the news of the past few months to him slowly and gradually, the emperor is a cunning man even in his advanced age and ferreted out all the details. He soon confronted Regent Maria, accusing her of attempting to usurp the throne, and intimating that he suspected her of poisoning him (possibly having gleaned such rumors during his investigations). Maria retorted that she was only fulfilling the role that he himself had charged her with, and that she had not done anything rash. The argument devolved into heated shouting, whereupon Pachacuti II seized the halberd-like staff which is the traditional Inca symbol of imperial office and struck Maria. To his horror, she collapsed on the floor. The stress of the situation overwhelmed Pachacuti : as the royal attendants raced into the room, they found him in the throes of a heart attack…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.A;¡Dios nos ayuda a todos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.T;False Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.D;Maria’s head wound proved fatal, and Pachacuti II died from a heart attack not long afterward. Palace officials quickly realized that allowing such news to leak out into the public could ignite chaos, inspire various Tupac-Cuzi members to feud for the throne, or even plunge the nation into another civil war like the disastrous struggle of the 17th century. Thus, the imperial clergy, recalling the ancient Inca traditions of venerating departed Sapa Incas, have declared that the emperor has “entered occlusion.” All mention of Maria’s rule as regent is being erased from official records, and a wawqi (detailed golden idol) of the emperor has been placed in the throne room. The empire shall continue to be “ruled” by Pachacuti II, with the Imperial College (a council of Catholic and indigenous pagan priests) led by the Willaq Umu interpreting his will. This new regency has caused widespread agitation in the Empire as Catholics refuse this idolatry and liberals the return of Inca absolutism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.A;Long live the Emperor...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.D;The emperor survived his heart attack, but he could not bear to live with himself, knowing what he had done. He went to the palace’s kitchen and locked himself inside, and, after attendants heard a loud thumping sound and forced open the door, was found dead. Perhaps inspired by his own accusations towards his daughter, he chose to poison himself using the Japanese fish which were to feature in tonight’s dinner. Tragically, Maria had not died, but was merely comatose, and awoke an hour after his death. Anguished by the revelation of her father’s suicide, she was inconsolable for days afterward. While all the empire grieves Pachacuti II, the government must continue. She has fulfilled her duty as Crown Princess and has been proclaimed Empress Maria, and her first act as sovereign has been to issue a new royal charter which empowers the Cortes Nacional and expands the voting franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.A;In the depths of suffering, the world has the audacity to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.D;While Pachacuti II’s memory never failed him, by 1880 his body was rapidly declining. He lost all vision in his left eye, could not walk without a cane (and gave up trying to use stairs after 1879), and rarely ventured beyond his manor or its immediate grounds. Yet even in this state, he refused to be idle. Shortly after his retirement, he had taken up painting, importing books on the art from Burgundy, Venice, Japan, and Qingqiu. The works that he produced in the final years of his life were described as “a sublime combination of European, Asian, and indigenous styles…though unrefined, possessing a sense of restrained and submerged beauty, of incipient wonder concealed in a manner which only heightens its allure.” It was at his canvas that the emperor was found dead this morning, having moved to the balcony to get a better view of the sunrise. The unfinished work, an impressionist rendering of Cusco as it was in the first Pachacuti’s time, would become a national symbol of a longing for the Inca Empire’s future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.A;From the Sun, he descended : to the Sun, he returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Tierra del Fuego;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.D;The southernmost extreme of Ameriga was dubbed “Tierra del Fuego” or “Land of Fire” by Spanish explorers, who saw the bonfires lit by native tribes of the region while sailing past. Though the weather and the seas of this region are infamously dangerous, countless vessels brave it each year to round the continent. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, consolidating our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a far-flung place, and the geographical security which its possession grants our empire, has increased the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Pampas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.D;The pampas, from the Quechua “plains,” have sustained nomadic peoples like the Het for thousands of years. Some of the best pastoral lands in the world, the pampas are also useful for farming. For many years, European colonizers have warred with the indigenous peoples, be they Beornians or other interlopers. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration of the Pampas. The acquisition of such a fertile place, and the protection from the eastern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Cartegena de Indias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.D;Many peoples have made their home in the Cartegena region – the Mocana of the Caribs were the most numerous when the Spanish arrived. Their violent subjugation of the region led them to christen it “Cartegena de Indias” after a notable Iberian city. It soon became one of the primary colonial nerve centers, processing vast amounts of trade, and gaining an international reputation as a major Amerigan and Caribbean port. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Cartegena de Indias. The acquisition of such an important and famous place, and the naval power projection which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Liberator of the Andes” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.D;The mighty Amazon River and its vast basin are home to a fantastic variety of life, plant and animal. The region’s ecological beauty and diversity is overwhelming – and so is its economic potential if the tremendous obstacles of geography could be overcome. Spain made some attempts to settle the northeastern basin, but it was the Dual Monarchy which claimed its coastal edge and thus the interior, a claim inherited by Amazonie. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in the Amazon River basin. The acquisition of such a massive and wondrous place, and the international prestige which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Guardian of the Amazon” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Ava;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.D;Ava, the land of the Guarani, is a bastion of indigenous culture in the heart of Ameriga. Possessing considerable agricultural wealth, as well as a particularly cohesive native identity (forged in the fires of adversity from Burgundian and later Lotharian colonization), Ava’s economic possibilities have laid untapped for ages. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a unique place, and the strengthened defense against the eastern and southern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Protector of the Guaranis” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.T;Imperial Majesty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.D;Who can resist Pachacuti II? From the depths of strife, he has raised up the Inca Empire to heights of power and fame never seen! Even the European colonizers have been forced to admit the overwhelming strength of the Inca Empire. Across the globe, our citizens are treated with respect. The word of our merchants is implicitly trusted : the allure of our culture entrances admirers from here to Anvers : and several smaller states have looked to our military while reforming their own forces. We have brought unto Ameriga the light of order, of enlightenment, of civilization, and we have done so without shoving European colonization down the natives’ throats. All of this is thanks to Emperor Pachacuti II! It is his glorious light which the grandeur of our realm magnifies and reflects all around us. The previous dynasty made pretensions of ruling the “known world,” but only we can truly be said to have brought the glory of the Inca across the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.A;A radiant sovereign is he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.T;The Pachacuti Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.D;Our influence has permeated the whole Amerigan continent. Now Emperor Pachacuti II has decided to officially announce our role as Ameriga’s shepherd. In a royal proclamation, he outlined what he referred to as our “Continental Obligation as Master of Ameriga” but which foreign observers have dubbed the “Pachacuti Doctrine.” The emperor stated that any incursions by foreign powers upon the Amerigan continent would be taken as a threat to the Inca Empire. The remarks brought forth a chorus of objections from European powers, and it is questionable how many of them will take this proclamation seriously. The true value of it is its expression of our overwhelming influence upon the continent, and the unity of its peoples beneath our imperial banner, directly or otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.A;We are the Protector of Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He has now decided to grant a constitution to the Inca Empire which has resulted in several traditional elements of our political system shifting to accommodate new ideas. The Cortes Imperiales has been formed to legislate policy – though with plenty of input from the emperor, of course. A separate judiciary has also been established, though again the imperial court holds significant influence within it. While democracy is slowly being embraced by the people, many aspects of our society remain apart from foreign liberal ideals. Still, the inevitable weakening of royal authority inherent in the expansion of democracy has necessarily reduced the hold the emperor over his country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.A;He is still great regardless! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He had decided to grant a royal charter to the Inca Empire but his proposed document was heavily modified at the insistence of many notable politicians. The resulting constitution  of the Inca Empire has created a great transformation of our political system. The Cortes Imperiales acts almost wholly separate from the emperor’s will, while the judiciary stands upon its own footing as well. Democracy and related ideas of popular power have swept across the nation, and much of our society is realigning towards it. This has substantially reduced royal authority and grandeur in a culture where the sovereign has for ages reigned in an absolute manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.A;Yet his brilliance still cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.T;The End of the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.D;For roughly four hundred years, the Andes were dominated by the Inca Empire. The region and the polity had for so long cohabited the same space that, in the minds of their subjects, they had become almost synonymous. But, as despot after despot came and went, the free spirit of the people persevered, never losing hope that one day they would be delivered from their servitude. That day has now come! Tupac’s dream of claiming the Inca throne and becoming another link in the chain of tyranny binding the people has been shattered. Rather than his absurd and hypocritical cherry-picking of Hispanic and Andean culture, both wholly self-serving of his imperialist aims, the national culture of $COUNTRY$ is now being realigned. The Romanticos are now hailed as our political ancestors, and their ideas used as the foundation for new political groups and aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.A;Freedom delayed and denied no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.T;The Beornian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.D;For too long, we have suffered the abuses of the insolent Beornians. Their raids have terrorized our southern frontier, and they have long sought to conquer vast swaths of said lands. If we are to ever be fully secure as a nation, then we must take severe measures to prevent the Beornians from ever threatening us again. The time has come to extend the hand of our protection over the indigenous peoples of southern Ameriga and drive the Beornians back eastwards. They will be allowed to possess the land necessary to survive, but never again will they raise their hands against our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.A;Camelot shall fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.T;The Inkans Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.D;When we heard that the Inkan Empire had been conquered by the heretical Catholic Quiteneses, we were all astonished, though it made some amount of sense given the modicum of superiority the Quiteneses held over the Inkan savages. What was truly shocking was when the mad ruler of Quito claimed the Inkan throne for himself and founded a new imperial dynasty! We always knew that Catholics were foul crypto-pagan heretics but few of us ever dreamed that fellow Christians would be capable of such insanity. Now, the northern abomination that is the new Inkan Empire has launched a war of aggression against us! Their treacherous diplomats babble all sorts of justifications for this, but we know that they are simply violent brutes. As our priests marshal the faithful for holy war, the sons of England prepare to crush these monstrous heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.A;For king and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.T;The Treaty of Camelot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.D;To the astonishment and horror of all our subjects, the Beornians have bested the imperial armies. A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the emperor was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside. The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to their capital city of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being. Pachacuti II and the whole Inca Empire have been humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.A;The Sapa Inca turns to the sky for answers but receives only rain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.T;Colonization of the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.D;The conquest of New Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that their conquest was just because of the Inca aggression. New Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers. However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt. When the Beornians did not act directly, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.A;Beornia acted in self-defense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.T;White Peace in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.D;Despite the best efforts of the Inka hordes, our mighty armies cloaked in the grace of God have fended off their assault upon our innocent kingdom. In the resulting peace treaty, the Inkans have been suitably humiliated. They have been forced to recognize our righteous sovereign as the rightful King of Beornia, forsaking their claims to any lands which we currently control. While some had hoped for a more decisive victory, many simply rejoice in the defeat of the heathen foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.A;God be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.T;The Year of Shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.D;Not since 1066, on that evil day when the Norman usurpers forced the yoke of slavery upon the Anglo-Saxon neck, have the faithful sons of England known such dark times as this. The savage Inkan despot has driven the whole Beornian Army from the field and arrived under arms at the gates of Camelot. He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept.\n\nThe Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.A:My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.T;Beornia Neutered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.D;As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of the Inca Empire to surround the capital of Camelot. Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to our enlightened rule. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their backwards nation and their bizarre Protestant Christian sect, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.A;And if they don’t, we have ways of discipling them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.T;Religion in the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.D;When Emperor Pachacuti II established our new imperial dynasty, many of both Catholic and traditional indigenous faiths were concerned about the religious future of our realm. Pachacuti II, however, knew that attempting to either stamp out the existing worship of gods like Inti, or discard the Catholic faith in favor of said gods, would be equally ruinous paths. Yet at the same time the emperor himself is still a Catholic and he does not pretend otherwise. Therefore, he has instituted liberty of personal conscience for religion, but allocating support towards the Catholic Church and depicting Catholic saints in the manner of certain local gods to encourage conversion. While Catholicism is not being imposed there is a general sense amongst our citizens that being a Catholic (or at least acting like one) is the best way to socially advance. Native believers are of course embittered by this but most are focused on preserving traditional ways rather than attempting to destroy the state’s aid of Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.A;In the beginning was the Word…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL53.T;The Civil Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL53.D;For ages, the fetters of organized religion have kept our citizens in chains. Both the Catholic Church and the state-managed faith of the natives were used by the elite to bind the people and subordinate their interests. This is no longer the case. We have taken great pains to exclude any mention of any religion from our constitution, and instituted strict, absolute, inviolable separation of church and state. No religious organization will receive so much as a penny of government funds from here on, and all churches must pay taxes. Ceremonies such as marriages, which used to require a priest, can now be accomplished through a simple civil procedure. While traditionalists of all religions are severely displeased by our actions, we are hopeful that future generations shall inherit a nation free of sectarianism or the sinister manipulations of the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

proclaim_the_empire_QUI_title;Proclaim a New Andean Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
proclaim_the_empire_QUI_desc;The time has come for Quito to transcend its origins. Starting as a colony imposed upon Chinchaysuyu, neither the old Inca nor the Spanish could have ever imagined that our enlightened Duke of Tupac would create something brilliant here in this oft-forgotten corner of the world. Now, the old Tawantinsuyu has been swept away, but we shall not annihilate it as that madman El Podenco sought to do. Instead, it shall be reborn by our will, reforged in our own image! Quito shall inherit the Realm of the Four Corners, like Alexander the Great’s Macedon inherited Persia. Of course, an Inca Empire will need a Sapa Inca, and who better than the Duke of Tupac? Due to his lineage, he is, after all, the true heir, the link between the fallen old order and the glorious new one. But, just as Quito shall be consigned to immortal memory, so shall his old title, ill-befitting his new splendor. Long live Pachacuti II, Liberator of the Andes and Emperor of the Four Corners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_INC_title;Establish the Avalonian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_INC_desc;Beornia, a state which once held delusions of royal majesty, is now in an even more pitiable state than before. While we have avenged the loyal imperial subjects which they murdered, leaving them alone presents too inviting a target for the Lotharians, who could snap up the region. Worse, we have heard rumors that several Lotharian politicians are scheming to convince the Beornians to join Lotharingia willingly, to lay claim to the entirety of Beornia’s former lands! This cannot be allowed, and therefore we must take action to stabilize the area. The Protectorate of Avalonia will keep the Beornians from growing too insolent by giving them a modicum of autonomy, while also shielding our southern flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
industrialization_chile_QUI_title;The Industrialization of Collasuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
industrialization_chile_QUI_desc;Our geologists and engineers have identified Collasuyu as ideally suited for industrial expansion. It possesses several valuable ores, as well as materials suited for the manufacture of gunpowder. If we were to focus the mitma system on bringing labor to the region, as well as financial assistance for the creation of new towns and the construction of factories, then it should not be difficult to build Collasuyu into a new manufacturing hub of $THISCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Romanticos_dream_title;Realize the Quitenese Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Romanticos_dream_desc;The clouds are lifting! At last, the old systems of division which the Spanish and the Inca cruelly created are within our power to end. Through a multitude of measures, including a standardized national curriculum to establish the Quitenese identity and language, we will liberate our citizens from their fractured status. No longer will separations of geography or language divide us, no longer will we be slaves of the mistakes of our ancestors. Our dream – our destiny to bring true democracy, first amongst our people, and then upon the world – shall now be made manifest! From this day forward, we are all Romanticos, and we are all Quiteneses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Araucania_ARE_title;Claim Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Araucania_ARE_desc;We have received word from several explorers that the Araucanian region may hold several deposits of valuable minerals. This news has caused many of our politicians to begin advocating that we reassert the old Inca claim to the region. For centuries, the peoples of Araucania were unruly subjects of the last dynasty, frequently rebelling and waging violent campaigns of resistance. However, with our enlightened rule – and our technological prowess – we should have no trouble avoiding the mistakes of our predecessors and bringing the region under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rebuking_Mercian_claims_title;Refute the Inkan Claims on New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rebuking_Mercian_claims_desc;The Inkan Empire has long laid claim to New Mercia, despite the fact that we have it on good authority that the savage tribes of the region never recognized their overlordship and frequently rebelled against them. In fact, the Inkans have continued to claim the region even after we, by the grace of God, claimed it for our blessed nation! That the savages were overthrown by the heretical Quiteneses, who established a new heathen empire in a fit of pure madness, is irrelevant. Now, at last, we have the political clout to proclaim our hegemony in the region and render their ridiculous pretenses null and void. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_Beornia_ARE_title;Claim Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_Beornia_ARE_desc;The very existence of Beornia is a threat to the continued stability and security of our empire. Their frontiersmen have raided the southern edge of the previous dynasty for centuries and we have no reason to believe this will end any time soon. Furthermore, if the Beornians were to ever gain noteworthy strength – or, more likely, be conquered by a more robust state in eastern Ameriga – then the entire southern section of our nation could be imperiled. Therefore it is necessary to strike before our enemies can, and conquer Beornia for our glorious empire! Doing so shall also bring many honorable native peoples into our benevolent embrace, peoples who shall join the ranks of other loyal subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_ARE_title;Establish the Avalonian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_ARE_desc;Beornia, a state which once held delusions of royal majesty, is now in an even more pitiable state than before. As it is our imperial mission to bring order to the chaos of the world, we cannot allow them to languish unprotected any longer. Leaving them alone presents too inviting a target for the Lotharians, who could snap up the region. Worse, we have heard rumors that several Lotharian politicians are scheming to convince the Beornians to join Lotharingia willingly, to lay claim to the entirety of Beornia’s former lands! This cannot be allowed, and therefore we must take action to stabilize the area.  Let us…make amends for the actions of our predecessors by officially “protecting” them. The Protectorate of Avalonia will keep the Beornians from growing too insolent by giving them a modicum of autonomy, while also shielding our southern flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_ARE_title;Claim the Amassonan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_ARE_desc;As we consolidate our righteous leadership of the native peoples of Ameriga – under the benevolent protection of the Inca Empire and the rule of its Sapa Inca, of course – we look to the mighty eastern river, the Amassona, and its peoples. It is well known that the eastern Amerigans, especially the Amazoniens and Atlantians, see the peoples of the east as chaff to cast out. We know better! These people, primitive though they may be, possess a nobility all their own. Furthermore, allowing a foreign power to seize these vast lands would bring them to the doorstep of our imperial heartland. Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into our empire for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_conquest_of_Granada_ARE_title;Claim Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_conquest_of_Granada_ARE_desc; Centuries ago, the Inca Empire extended much further north than it currently does, all the way into the central area of what the Spanish dubbed “New Granada.” These lands were once populated by robust peoples such as the Musica, and though the Spanish may have devoured their nations, their descendants remain in rural communities. Furthermore, many Granadans are themselves descended from these peoples, however much their rulers may pretend otherwise. Our government has thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the liberation of the mestizos of the north is our sacred mission, our destiny! Let us illuminate Granada with our holy light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_het_ARE_title;Integrate the Het;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_het_ARE_desc;The Het peoples of the Pampas formerly inhabited eastern Beornia, but were driven further and further west by generations of settlers. While epidemics have devastated their peoples and many of them have assimilated into neighboring indigenous groups, there remains a distinct Het ethnic and cultural identity. These peoples are experienced at living on the plains in ways which many of our own are not. Furthermore, their historical grievances against the Beornians give them ample reason to side with us against the settlers. By recognizing their cultural institutions and extending them full citizenship, we will consolidate our hold on southern Ameriga and shore up its cultural stability against further Beornian assimilation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_granadans_ARE_title;Integrate the Granadans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_granadans_ARE_desc;While many of the wealthier and more famous Granadans are fair-skinned, in truth the Granadan population at large is quite mestizo. Their status as an indigenous influenced but thoroughly Hispanophone culture makes them an ideal representation of the type of society which we are seeking to build. If we are ever to maintain our rule in the north, then we must win the loyalty or at least the confidence of the Granadans. By recognizing their cultural institutions and extending them full citizenship, we will consolidate our hold on northern Ameriga and shore up its cultural stability against any resurgence of Granadan nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
occupation_of_araucania_ARE_title;Annex Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
occupation_of_araucania_ARE_desc;We have received word from several explorers that the Araucanian region may hold several deposits of valuable minerals. This news has caused many of our politicians to begin advocating that we reassert the old Inca claim to the region. For centuries, the peoples of Araucania were unruly subjects of the last dynasty, frequently rebelling and waging violent campaigns of resistance. However, with our enlightened rule – and our technological prowess – we should have no trouble avoiding the mistakes of our predecessors and bringing the region under our control. Thankfully no centralized government has yet been established there so we should be able to simply send our forces southward and occupy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
pachamaq_capital_title;Move the Capital to Pachamaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
pachamaq_capital_desc;We have taken control of many former Inca lands, but attempting to rule it all from a capital located so far north as Quito is proving burdensome for our administration. Our planners have identified the community of Pachamaq as the overall best candidate for the new capital city. Unlike somewhere such as Cusco, Pachamaq has far less problematic significance and connections to the Inca Empire. Its current layout is not quite sufficient to replace Quito, but through modernizing its infrastructure and expanding streets and housing, we should be able to enlarge and beautify Pachamaq into a gem opulent enough to rival the great cities of the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

MGH1.T;The End of the Kabylite Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH1.D;We promised to enter into their mountains, to burn their unsophisticated villages and their meager harvests, we promised to cut down their fruit trees to the last. In the end, Muhyi al-Din’s Revolt of the Kabylite Berbers ended with the reclamation the pearls of the Crown of Africa, Alger and Bugía, and the punishment of the tribes of Mézzaia with expulsion or death behind the Atlas and the Aurès. While some of our brothers in faith to the North may defame our effort at bringing civilization to the savage Mohammedans who dared to threaten fellow Christians at the African Coast, that the bloodshed of the sieges and expulsions were even unnecessary and extreme, but they have lost their roots in centuries of idleness. For we do not fight for our Kingdom of Africa, nor for the banner which unites it with her sister kingdoms under the Crown of Aragon, that is not enough. We fight for Christendom! Let this serve as a warning and a testament to our dominance that extends over the African river, until the desert farther forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH1.A;It's our divine fief, and price of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH2.T;The Success of the Kabylite Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH2.D;The unexpected has occurred. Great Tragedy struck the courts of our kingdoms, as the accursed Kabylite Muhyi al-Din proclaims his final victory in his holy war against our fellow Christians of Africa. So too has Mustafa I of the Hafsid Sultanate used the opportunity to betray our centuries-old treaties and stolen the towns we have build upon the sweat, tears, and blood of our peoples. As the muezzins of Carthago after two centuries once more openly call for the Mohammedan prayer, we hear of the great atrocities committed by the savage Berbers and Arabs alike. While we remain in position to not give up hope on our crown of Africa with the fortified port towns in the West remaining under our benevolent hands, the loss of the pearls of Africa, Alger, Bugía, and Carthago, remains painful and not easily forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH2.A;Once more, innocent Christian feet soaked in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH3.T;The Situation beyond the Atlas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH3.D;Ever since the conquests of Africa under pious King John III in the 16th century and the good rule of this fief under the subsequent kings of the crowns of Aragon, the Kingdom of Africa has prospered as the buzzling ports of Carthago and Alger proved to be a merchant’s heaven. But as we restored Christendom to the shores of Africa and Aethiopia, the infidel Mohammedans in their eternal jealousy repeatedly razed our cities and villages, our plantations, and mines, soaking the ground with the blood of settlers, giving them their name “Peu-Vermell”. Even nowadays, these raids organized by Tuggurt continue, though today in their savagery they assaulted and almost killed the Count of Tabraca Ferran who previously set alight Mohammedan Ouargla in 1835. We have been pushed by the Peu-Vermell for some time to pacify the hinterland, but now their cause rings true in the cortes of the Crown. That interest in land-clearing and more acquisitions of the well-established plantation owners of Africa can assuredly be seen as a minor benefit beside the revenge of Ferran of Tabraca…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH3.A;As our forebears, we will crusade until the desert farther forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH4.T;The Modern Reconquista?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH4.D;Alfonso XIII defeated the upstart Saadi Sultan Abu Abdallah in the Battle of Xauen of 1571 cultivating an obsession with anachronistic medieval knightly ideals and the idea of a crusade to reclaim a lost Mauretanian province of Christendom, an idea continuing to this day. The modern Sultanate of Fez ruled by the Majjatid Dynasty since the 17th century remains under the firm control of the finances, loyal tribal allies, and military prowess of the Spanish Crown with the Sultan Ismail II rotting away in his Golden Cage in Fez. With the rise of nationalist rhetoric in our kingdom and the relative success of the Aragonese Kingdom of Africa, voices become louder to allow for the Christian settlement of Mauretania, even if it might anger the locals. In a bargain-hunting frenzy to take over or buy at low prices all manner of property - homes, shops, farms, and factories - Europeans might pour into Morocco in the case of direct annexation. But for now, only the idealistic notion of a revival of a Crown of Mauretania remains. But for how long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

MGH5.T;The Modern Reconquista?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH5.D;Alfonso XIII defeated the upstart Saadian Abu Abdallah in the Battle of Xauen of 1571 cultivating an obsession with anachronistic medieval knightly ideals and the idea of a crusade to reclaim a lost Mauretanian province of Christendom, an idea continuing to this day. The modern Sultanate of Fez ruled by the Majjatid Dynasty since the 17th century remains under the firm control of the finances, loyal tribal allies, and military prowess of the Spanish Republic with the Sultan Ismail II rotting away in his Golden Cage in Fez. With the rise of nationalist rhetoric in our new republic and the relative success of Aragonese Africa, voices become louder to allow for the Christian settlement of Mauretania, even if it might anger the locals. The crown previously prevented a bargain-hunting frenzy to take over or buy at low prices all manner of Moroccan property such as homes, shops, farms, and factories, but we as an enlightened force do not see the need to prevent the ousting of locals for the true citizens of Spain, the Christians of a greater Spanish Republic…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH5.A;No one who wears a crown, be it Christian or Mohammedan, shall be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH6.T;The Fate of Fez;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH6.D;The Sultanate of Fez can accurately be described as a husk bereft of will, only a tool upheld by local tribes and the Spanish authorities dictating the finances of the decaying state. Nothing lasts forever, nor should it, however. Time passes, and things change, that is nature's way. The demented Sultan Ismail II has passed away in high age recently and the only son who survived the various court intrigues of Fez is Yazid I, a simpleton whose hedonism angers even the few remaining loyalist forces of the sultanate. The time is therefore ripe for the removal of Yazid I, though the method remains unclear. We could install Yazid I’s infant cousin Mohammed III upon the throne under the guise of a protectorate over Morocco, but the alluring idea of a restoration of the Mauretanian province and opening up the country for settler colonialism akin to the New World of old captured the heart of many. The former will assuredly remain relatively bloodless while the latter scenario can only be built upon unspeakable atrocities in the name of Christ and country…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH6.A;We will make Fez a protectorate under Spanish control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH6.B;We will restore Mauretania, no matter the cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH7.T;The Fate of Fez;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH7.D;Sultan Ismail II Ibn Mohammed of the Majjati line has passed away, and his son and successor Yazid I Ibn Ismail has proven to be a bane for our country. In our weakness, the callous Spaniards have already neutered us by taking over the North and now come for the rest as they seem to have caught wind of the widespread unpopularity of pleasure-seeker Yazid I. They have approached some of our highest officials, including the vizier Hamza al-Sanhaji, with the plans of a palace coup replacing Yazid I with his infant cousin Mohammed III. §RThis would, however, mean the end of our independence and making us a mere protectorate under Spanish authority, at best.§! §GNot accepting this offer comes close to a betrayal as well, to which the infidels would not react kindly upon.§! This dilemma is not solvable. May Allah have mercy upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH7.A;Fez may end, but our people will endure, and perhaps one day, restore Morocco...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH7.B;In the name of the madness of the daring, we defy Spain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH8.T;Refusal of the Terms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH8.D;“Thou Spanish unbeliever, servant of Shaytan, we bring the message of the faithful, believers of Allah the all-knowing and the merciful and his prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Your offer is an insult upon Our dignity, Our history, and Our righteous faith. Thy army we fear not, and by land and by sea we will do battle against thee: For those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the Shaytan. And what is the matter with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah and for the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, "Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper?". Your cause is unjust and cannot prevail.”\n\n In their idiocy, the Moroccans expectedly refused to abide by our benevolent terms. The letter “accidentally” already leaked to the wider public with expected results of outrage. And as the nation prepares to wage war against the Mohammedans, we will ask the vizier in Fez…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

MGH9.T;The Rif Revolt of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH9.D;The North of Morocco up to the Pass of Taza had been under complete Spanish control since shortly before the Colombian Wars in the New World. While destitute, the Rif is a resource-rich region with rich fishing grounds which the ports of Granada and the industrialists of the realm took notice in. Since the restoration of Mauretania, focus shifted away from the Rif, however, and after a local famine in $YEAR$ in which the harvests where shipped from there to be exported to Europe, the anger of the locals has reached a point of no return: Abdelhamid Bennani al-Zenati, local but powerful chieftain, has lost hope of negotiating with the Spanish and called for an armed struggle and holy war against the alleged occupier which is keen on erasing both Islam and the local peoples in the name of a supposedly long-dead idealized Mauretania. With resolute heart, however, Mauretanian authorities and thus Spain as a whole will vehemently stand against this revolt espousing a false hope for the freedom of savages among the agitated Riffians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH9.A;The Lord shall rain down burning sulfur on the Rif, and its savages shall know their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH10.T;The Reconquista Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH10.D;Since the Battle of Covadonga, Iberia has been plagued by the Mohammedans who reigned with terror against civilization. But our God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd through the blood of the eternal covenant, favoured us, and we drove them from Spain across the Sea after the fall of Granada in 1492. In their folly, they continued to exist and harass us with unjust wars to defend their lands from the light of Christ. With the final end of opposition in $YEAR$, the millennia of Reconquista finally ends: Bennani’s rotting corpse hanging upside down on the gates to Melilla, the savage Berbers mutilated and burnt, and their women and children indebted to serve the whims of the superior Spanish people, the last vestiges of Islam will slowly but surely be removed by our just authority, and their savage culture erased for a superior civilization. Below us these Moors though they may be, they occupied a land of plentiful resources, which will now and forever be enjoyed by all Spaniards as the integral province of Mauretania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH10.A;Tears will never wash away the pain of the vanquished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH11.T;The Reconquista Fulfilled?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH11.D;Since the Battle of Covadonga in 722, Iberia has been plagued by the Mohammedans. With the pacification of the Rif in $YEAR$, many espouse that the Reconquista which lasted for more than a 1000 years finally ended, though the reality may be a bit more nuanced: the Scourge of the Rif Bennani is dead, but the Sultan Mohammed III still reigns as a mere child in Fez, with the daily governing being conducted by skillful Spaniards. The End of the Rif Revolt should serve as an example to the remaining separatist forces of Morocco that the Spanish protectorate over their domain is just and preferable to the wild savagery the Moors might have preferred without our benevolent guidance. And as normalcy slowly returns to our protectorate, compliance of the locals with our superior way of living emerges…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH11.A;Perhaps one day Jerusalem returns to our hands as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH12.T;The Reconquista Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MGH12.D;“No matter how difficult, there must be no compromises when seeking freedom. The aspirations of freedom and self-determination of our people will last beyond the power of oppressors who seem to have condemned individual slavery, yet do not condemn the slavery of entire nations.” - Abdelhamid Bennani, leader of the Rif Revolt \n\n Against the expectations of international observers and to the joy of anti-colonial theoreticians and practitioners, the Rif Revolt under the Banner of its leader Bennani succeeded with thunderous victories against Spain which stands humiliated on the international stage. Bennani will go on to continue to reform his state into modernity, to prevent the return of the foreign oppression and intervention, but the politicians and people of Spain for now remain speechless in the face of the incompetence of the Spanish military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

22260.T;Mauretanian Autonomy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
22260.D;The new crown jewel of our Spanish state, Mauretania, has been a colony in which many of the aspirations of those dissatisfied with our standing in the New World have been satisfied. So far, Mauretania has been ruled by a simple governor appointed by the Spanish head of state, but as Mauretania develops into a full-fledged participant of the European economy, calls for Mauretanian autonomy within our country keep growing as some vocal voices accuse of treating this integral part of the Spanish homelands as a mere colony from which to extract value out from instead of actively developing the lands for the Christian settlers. The deniability of these claims is increasingly a matter of satire in Iberia as the Mauretanian cause appears just, though not denying this request will lead to the release of Mauretania as an autonomy within the state, meaning a sizable portion of profit lost to $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

22261.D;The Kingdom of Africa emerged in the 17th century as part of the Aragonese crusade against the Mohammedans who terrorized our mercantile activities. Ever since then, the Kingdom developed with its own success stories and failures. Now, in $YEAR$, Africa and the Peu-Vermell who live there live in relative autarky, exporting fruits, vegetables, and other raw resources to Europe at competitive margins while developing the various ports of Africa to become the true Jewels of the Mediterranean. Calls for autonomy by the Peu-Vermell are therefore both relatively warranted and unsurprising in the face of colonial ventures of other European states, though granting the African province this autonomy stands in opposition to our long tradition of keeping the various cortes aligned with $CAPITAL$ and would slash a sizable portion of our income. Refusing this request would, however, lead to some anger…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

voc_annex_java_desc;The Terres Princières (Princely Lands) were three native states on the island of Java in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indies that were nominally self-governing under the suzerainty of the VOC, two of the major states were the Sultanates of Yogyakarta and Bantam. Their political autonomy was however severely constrained by treaties and settlements. The princely territories were successor states to the Mataram Sultanate and originated in civil wars and wars of succession within the Javanese nobility.\n\nThe Terres Princières have long been under our protection. It would be in our best interests to convince them to come under our direct rule, so we might bring civilization to their people more effectively, and so that we might secure their lands from other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

voc_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration (Courte Déclaration) was short and brief because it contrasted with the "long" contracts that were earlier concluded between the Burgundian Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands.\n\nThe latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Burgundian Indies government were met. The long contracts defined the limits of the competency of both rulers and the Burgundian Indies government.\n\nBy issuing the Short Declaration, we will declare these contracts null and void and we will bring the remaining princes under our direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333296.T;The Burgundian East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333296.D;The Vereenigde Burgundische Oost Indsiche Compagnie (VOC) has been described as a cabal of merchants with a state. One of the wealthiest organizations in the world, it has turned its economic might into political and military clout, exerting administrative control and military might throughout the East Indies. While only a small population of Dutch and Burgundian traders form the core population, the obscene wealth of this merchant class allows them to maintain an iron grip on what is essentially a private colony. The VOC is an economic juggernaut, and its merchants hungrily seek any opportunity to further their own fortunes, no matter what it takes. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333270.D;The ongoing struggle between the Jeanists and Parlimentarians has reached a boiling point, with the two factions reaching a state of open war and throwing Burgundy into chaos. While this poses a threat to the Company's assets in Europe, the collapse of state power provides an unprecedented opportunity to break free of Burgundy and declare political and economic sovereignty. No longer will we have to bow to Anvers - the wealth of East Asia is ours for the taking, and ours alone. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333271.D;With the outbreak of war in Burgundy, our assets in Europe are compromised, cutting us off from material support and funding. While our wealth is immense, without vital infrastructure and industry we cannot hope to maintain our rule in the Indies for long. Already the local princes we rely on for administration and support are dissenting, with some even speaking of open rebellion. Without aid from Europe, our regime may rapidly collapse.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333275.D;After a prolonged struggle, we have overthrown the Company and stormed their offices in Batavia. Burgundian garrisons across the archipelago are surrendering or deserting in droves. With the collapse of European rule, the various princes of the region have met in $CAPITAL$, and pledged their support for a united Nusantaran state, with our nation at the forefront. With our forces combined, bolstered by seized Company weapons and funding, we have planted the seeds of a new united and modernized state that the Great Powers of Europe will be forced to reckon with.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333279.D;With our support, the local princes of the East Indies have revolted from the Company and established a new united state claiming the entire region. Thanks to our intervention, the new state has fallen into our influence and is reliant on us for economic support. The imperialists in our government seek to use this opportunity to claim further concessions and directly increase our presence in the region. The fledgeling state is in a weak posistion, and is unlikely to stand up to us. How shall we proceed?   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333282.T;Die Groot VOC;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333282.D;With the rebellion against us crushed, we remain the undisputed hegemony of Indonesia.

333300.T;Burgundy Demands Submission of Princes ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.D;With the situation in Burgundy stabilizing, our European rulers have decided to take a more direct hand in the affairs of the East Indies, and demanded that the local princes report to them directly rather than through us. We are unable to contest this without provoking escalation, and this serves as a warning that our rule may be under threat from home.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.A;Ominous. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.T;The Traitorous Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.D;With the civil war ravaging our nation over, our attention turns to our former crown jewel in the east, which has outrageously used our moment of weakness to play at being kings of their own little fiefdom. These upstart merchants cannot be allowed to break free, and must be reminded that they exist to serve the crown! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.A;Demand their immediate submission! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.T;Dealing with the VOC ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.D;With the domestic situation stable, the attention of the crown has turned again to the East Indies Company. While their financial influence and worldwide wealth is unparalleled, corruption permeates every layer of the administration, and commonplace bribery and embezzlement are open secrets. We have let the Company exist on too long a leash for too long, and it is time to reign in these upstart merchants.   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.A;Demand they return to the fold. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.T;The East Indies Nightmare ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.D;Our once prosperous administration in the East Indies has collapsed. A native uprising has spread like wildfire throughout the islands, and the VOC offices in Batavia have been stormed and ransacked. Colonial administrators and merchants have been imprisoned or even lynched for their brutality towards the natives, and the local princes have united under a common banner. While we have little love for the Company as an independent actor, this threat to our interests in the Far East cannot be left unanswered.    ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.A;Prepare a punitive expedition. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.D;With Burgundy stabilized, Anvers has decided to reassert its global influence. Citing obviously false examples of rampant corruption at every level of the Company, the Burgundian government has demanded immediate dissolution of our colonial administration, placing our Company lands under direct rule of the crown and relegating us to a purely financial role. Accepting would mean the immediate dissolution of our holdings in the East and reincorporation into the Crown. Refusing would surely mean escalation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.A;We have no choice but to submit. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.B;We will not surrender our wealth and power! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.T;The Company Folds ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.D;In a rare moment of considering the good of the crown above their own profit, the VOC has agreed to our demands to relinquish control of the East Indies. The region will be directly administered as a crown colony, and the majority of company assets have been seized by the state. While the Company remains a powerful financial entity, their status as a semi-independent corporate nation has come to an end. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.A;Let them know their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.T;The East Indies Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but if we do not act it is likely another actor will take advantage of the situation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.A;Declare our support and protection over the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.B;The risks are too dangerous, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but it presents the opportunity to gain a strong ally in the region and place the Company in our debt. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.A;Declare our support and protection of the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.B;This is too dangerous a move, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.T;New Foreign Sponsor ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.D;Through our diplomatic manoeuvring, we have found a new Great Power to sponsor and protect our fledgeling state. While some of our directors see this as trading Burgundian overlordship for another, this pragmatic move will help us maintain stability while we cement our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.A;The most pragmatic option. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.T;We Stand Alone ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.D;Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find a new European sponsor to protect us. While some scoff at the need for foreign overlords, without support from abroad we are in a tenuous position against Burgundy. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.A;Troublesome... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.D;The treacherous merchants of the East Indies company have managed to coerce another European power to protect them in exchange for influence. Our plans to reconquer them are in jeopardy, as to move now risks sparking a greater European conflict. We may continue to press our demands, but this would easily spiral into a greater war than we are prepared for. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.A;No matter - the Indies will be ours again! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.B;We will bide our time... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.T;Burgundy Withdraws ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.D;Burgundy has renounced its claims over the East Indies and we have forced them to acknowledge the independence of the East Indies Company. No longer bound to Anvers, we have secured our independence and our control of the East Indies! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.A;The spice will flow. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.T;End of the East India Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.D;After a protracted struggle, the East India Company has been forced to submit to us, and relinquish their control over the East Indies. Their colonial administration has been dismantled, and the region will be now ruled directly by the Burgundian government. With their primary colonial holding seized, the VOC's power has been broken, and they will never again challenge our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.A;They have learned their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.T;Future of the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.D;With our independence secured and Burgundy withdrawing from the East Indies, the time has come to consider the future of the region and our administration. One faction of the company believes that in order to survive, the native princes must be invited to form a modern government alongside the Burgundian administration, forming a native republic with a modern European foundation. A more reactionary faction believes that any level of reform is unnecessary, and that the Company can continue to rule as a corporate autocracy, run by and for the merchant class. While the long term stability of this move is questionable, the profit margin is undeniable. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.A;We cannot rule over a disenfranchised population - declare the Republic of Indonesia! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.B;We are free of all oversight - our wealth is all that matters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA1.T;The Council of New Granada in Bogota;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA1.D;The end of the war with Spain has left northern Ameriga in an uncertain position. Guillermo de Blanco controls Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte rules Aureliana, and Martin Ballivian holds Quito, but New Granada is not yet whole. All three men and their associates have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to reconcile and determine the future of New Granada. The meeting may be tense, as Rocafuerte – already disliked by de Blanco due to his dubious, possibly mulatto, ancestry, and outspoken opposition to slavery – has begun to speak out against de Blanco’s increasingly violent and erratic behavior, while Ballivian is seen as an outsider who may attempt to push both other men aside in pursuit of his own designs. Ballivian’s spies are rumored to already be operating around Bogota…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA1.A;We have won the war and now must win the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA2.T;The Council of New Granada in Bogota;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA2.D;Spain has been cast out of New Granada, but the struggle is not over yet. Guillermo de Blanco of Herreria has grown more violent and erratic since the end of the revolution, with his second-in-command Antonio Rocafuerte of Aureliana strongly questioning his leadership. In the interest of solidarity, both men have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to determine New Granada’s future, and our leader Martin Ballivian has made it plain that he will attend as well. Neither man should be underestimated and it is unlikely that they will accept Ballivian’s leadership. Therefore we have sent several army units ahead in disguise to blend in with the locals, should the need arise for them…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA2.A;We will be prepared for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA3.T;The Council Dissolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA3.D;Bogota proved fruitless. None of the three revolutionaries could agree on New Granada’s future. Rocafuerte sought a monarchy, Ballivian a decentralized confederation, and de Blanco a centralized republic. There were also de Blanco’s repeated demands for extreme restrictions on all indigenous peoples, as well as calling for war with Tawantinsuyu so often that he was privately compared with Cato the Censor. Worst of all was that each man insisted that he assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. All three men have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA3.A;What happened to solidarity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA4.T;Rocafuerte Attempts a Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA4.D;Rocafuerte did not accept the failure of the Council of New Granada – he wanted a unified state, nothing less. As soon as he departed, he met up with his personal guard, their numbers bolstered by monarchist sympathizers who had made their way to Bogota for this purpose. Soon they marched on the Royal Library of Santa Fe, intent on surrounding the building and forcing Ballivian and de Blanco to accept Rocafuerte as the new Emperor of New Granada. While Rocafuerte loyalists have also been dispatched to seal off Bogota and prevent the other two men from escaping, rumors swirl that they may have already made it out of the city…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA4.A;New Granada’s future hangs by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA5.T;The Bogota Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA5.D;Rocafuerte had barely established his royalist junta before it became known that both Ballivian and de Blanco had escaped. The Quitenese caudillo soon returned with his own forces! He had expected resistance and had sent soldiers ahead of him, who dispersed in disguise throughout the surrounding villages, hiding his true strength. At his signal they rallied to southern Bogota – but Ballivian had to make a choice. Rocafuerte had a larger army than he had anticipated, and more were coming. Fleeing back to Quito would be the safer option, but without glory. Fighting Rocafuerte in the streets could earn him hegemony in Hispanic Ameriga but could also be the death of him. In the end, he chose to…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA5.A;Leave the fighting to his general, Ferdinand Torres.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA5.B;Meet the traitor Rocafuerte head on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA6.T;The Battle of Bogota;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA6.D;The Ballivianistas and the Rocafuertistas engaged in pitched fighting throughout the city and its surrounding environs. Through Ballivian’s cunning use of the local geography, Rocafuerte’s forces were lured into a series of ambushes and whittled down to a fraction of their former strength. In the confusion, de Blanco also attempted to rally his own forces against both men but was similarly overcome. Ballivian’s men captured both traitors and, after a swift trial for conspiring against “the New Granadan people,” they were publicly hanged. With Ballivian now preparing for the war with the Inca, he has delegated rule of the northern provinces to several trusted (and rather unambitious) lieutenants until the southern threat is dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA6.A;¡Viva Ballivian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA7.T;The Flight of Ballivian;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA7.D;Ballivian managed to escape Rocafuerte’s trap. Activating several Quitenese cells who had infiltrated the region in the weeks prior to the Council, his forces fought a rearguard action until he had made his escape. However, the Quiteneses proved unwilling to challenge the Aurelianan coup, and now Rocafuerte has one last obstacle : de Blanco, his former leader. De Blanco is believed to be heading to Cartagena to rally his main army and confront Rocafuerte, but their loyalty is wavering with rumors spreading of de Blanco’s mental instability. If Rocafuerte captures him before he arrives then this drama could come to an abrupt close, but if not, New Granada will know war once again…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA8.T;Proclamation of the New Granadan Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA8.D;It ended, fittingly, in a church. De Blanco and his men, cornered in a small village between Cartagena and Bogota, took refuge in the local parish. They mounted a last stand which ended when a young captain named Simon Morillo ran into the storehouse being used as a powder room and torched the magazine. The resulting fireball killed himself, de Blanco, and most of the republicans. Though rumors persist of de Blanco’s survival, nearly all the republicans have surrendered. In a grand ceremony in Bogota, Rocafuerte was crowned Antonio I, Emperor of New Granada! To encourage support for the new regime, his first act as sovereign was to adopt a limited constitution to lay the realm’s legal foundation and combat charges of absolutism. As the Emperor is an abolitionist, having had many former slaves amongst his llanero raiding parties, he has also ended slavery across New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA9.T;The New Granadan Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA9.D;“Flee the country where a lone man holds all power : It is a nation of slaves.” - José de Herrera\n\nDe Blanco proved too wily to be captured. Upon his arrival in Cartagena, he denounced Rocafuerte as a traitor and an aspiring despot, likening him to the hated King Jose II of Spain and even the “preening autocrat of the Incans!” Across Herreria, republican support has surged, and Rocafuerte and his men fled back to Aurelia to avoid being swept up in the chaos. What began as a squabble between revolutionary allies-turned-rivals has escalated into a clash of ideas, a confrontation between republicanism and monarchism which will determine the fate of Hispanic Ameriga and the tenor of its soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA9.A;May God grant victory to our perseverance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA10.T;Proclamation of the New Granadan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA10.D;After a series of grueling confrontations, de Blanco’s republicans have finally defeated Rocafuerte’s monarchists. The final battle saw Rocafuerte lead his personal guard on a valiant but doomed cavalry charge straight towards de Blanco’s lines, where the would-be emperor perished in his saddle from a rifle shot to the chest. De Blanco returned to Bogota in triumph and was acclaimed by a cheering crowd as the first President of New Granada! However, some are already concerned about the intended path of his rule. Though he has organized elections to compose a new legislature, he has upheld wartime censorship and is personally overseeing the redrawing of electoral constituencies. He has also become known for his…strong remarks about Indians and blacks and has remained mute on the issue of slavery. It is hoped that he shall grow into his new role as leader of New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA11.T;Proclamation of the New Granadan Empire ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA11.D;It ended, fittingly, in a church. De Blanco and his men, their forces shattered from repeated defeats by Rocafuerte’s monarchists, took refuge in a small parish near Cartagena. They mounted a last stand which ended when a young captain named Simon Morillo ran into the storehouse being used as a powder room and torched the magazine. The resulting fireball killed himself, de Blanco, and most of the republicans. Though rumors persist of de Blanco’s survival, nearly all the republicans have surrendered.

GRA12.T;The Dissolution of New Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA12.D;New Granada, barely even alive, has already perished at the hands of its supposed liberators. The republicans of Herreria and the monarchists of Aureliana proved unable to overcome one another, and de Blanco and Rocafuerte were forced to partition the embryonic nation after a series of bitter peace negotiations. While each man is now free to shape his country as he sees fit, the dream of a united New Granada has set beyond the horizon like the fading sun. De Blanco and Rocafuerte may go down in history as the fathers of their respective nations, but they will always be foremost remembered as the men who destroyed New Granada for the sake of their own ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA12.A;Ameriga is ungovernable by us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA13.T;The Council of Granada in Bogota;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA13.D;The end of the war with Spain has left northern Ameriga in an uncertain position. Guillermo de Blanco controls Herreria and Antonio Rocafuerte rules Aureliana, but New Granada is not yet whole. Both men and their associates have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to determine the future of New Granada. The meeting may be tense, as Rocafuerte – already disliked by de Blanco due to his dubious, possibly mulatto, ancestry, and outspoken opposition to slavery – has begun to speak out against de Blanco’s increasingly violent and erratic behavior. He has even proposed that New Granada may require a monarchy to stabilize it, much to de Blanco’s disdain…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA13.A;We have won the war and now must win the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA14.T;The Council Dissolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA14.D;Bogota proved fruitless. Neither of the former revolutionary allies or their supporters could agree on New Granada’s future. Rocafuerte sought a monarchy, but de Blanco declared that anything less than a republic would be too tainted by the influences of Spain and even Tawantinsuyu. There were also de Blanco’s repeated demands for extreme restrictions on all indigenous peoples, as well as calling for war with the Incans so often that he was privately compared with Cato the Censor. Worst of all was that each man insisted that he assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. Both of them have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA14.A;Whatever happened to solidarity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA15.T;Rocafuerte Attempts a Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA15.D; Rocafuerte did not accept the failure of the Council of New Granada – he wanted a unified state, nothing less. As soon as he departed, he met up with his personal guard, their numbers bolstered by monarchist sympathizers who had made their way to Bogota for this purpose. Soon they marched on the Royal Library of Santa Fe, intent on surrounding the building and forcing de Blanco to accept Rocafuerte as the new Emperor of New Granada. While Rocafuerte loyalists have also been dispatched to seal off Bogota and prevent his former commander from escaping, rumors swirl that de Blanco may have already made it out of the city…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA15.A;New Granada’s future hangs by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA16.T;The Battle of Bogota;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA16.D;De Blanco had already fled the Library by the time Rocafuerte arrived, and rallied his own forces to confront his former lieutenant. Brutal street-by-street fighting ensued as the whole city and the surrounding area became the site of a pitched struggle between Blancistas and Rocafuertistas. So far neither side has been able to gain a decisive advantage. If this battle results in a stalemate, then either Rocafuerte or de Blanco may be forced to flee Bogota and gather their main armies elsewhere. Such a development could only result in civil war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA16.A;We must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRA17.T;The Proclamation of the New Granadan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA18.T;The Opportunity of a Lifetime;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GRA18.D;The end of Ballivian’s quest to liberate Quito has been a disaster for Hispanic Ameriga. Rather than rest in the hands of a visionary bringer of civilization, Quito has fallen into the grasp of all manner of petty despots and rogues. Now, the savage Incans seek to cut a swath of destruction across the continent, and Quito lies in the path of their blade. This is too hideous a fate for New Granada to tolerate! President de Blanco knows this, and so he has made the momentous decision to intervene in the war, seeking to both protect Quito and destroy the Incan threat forever. While the manner of his…”protection” of Quito may perturb some, the only way that Hispanic Ameriga will ever be safe is if it is unified, as de Herrera always knew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best of them are fit for servitude alone : the worst are life undeserving of life, mere shells to be discarded.” – Guillermo de Blanco\n\nThe Empire of the Four Corners lies in ruins. New Granada has taken all that was once strong, vibrant, and beautiful in the southern Andes, and obliterated it. The imperial armies were bested in the very lands of our ancestors, and the foreign savages surged south.

His loss, and the ensuing pillaging of both the capital proper and the areas under occupation, have devastated the Incan Empire beyond all hope of recovery. We have thus taken this opportunity to reorganize the Inca state to suit our interests. All local Inca chiefs will be purged, and all lands seized by the state to be sold off to new settlers. Pagan temples will be destroyed, and churches erected upon the ruins. Of particular interest is the mita system of labor, which should smooth over the transition to a more…modern form of service for the inferior races. The old city of Cusco will be demolished to make way for a new, modern one. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is now our property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRA21.D;Guillermo de Blanco, President of New Granada, has long harbored ambitions of unifying Hispanic Ameriga and enacting his vengeance upon the Inca. However, our own war has caused him to place the former ahead of the latter and declare war upon us! While he and his government insist that their forces are “protecting” Quito from the Inca hordes, this is clearly not a mere support expedition, but a full-fledged invasion of both ourselves and the Inca at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President de Blanco knows this, and so he has made the momentous decision to intervene in the war, seeking to both protect Quito and destroy the Incan threat forever.

Now, with the Incan puma at our gates, he has rallied his forces and declared his intervention on our side! Just this morning, de Blanco himself arrived in Quito in full military dress along with his advance guard, with the rest of the New Granadan army to follow. The two great liberators of the Andes, Ballivian and de Blanco, shall stand side by side once again, for the sake of all civilized peoples in Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expansion_into_Andagoya_desc;Andagoya was once attached to the colonial Viceroyalty of New Castile, but was occupied by the Colombian Alliance during the early nineteenth century and was separated from us when the wars with Spain ended. Now, however, our nation is united and free, and ready to reclaim our lost territories. Engineers across the world have begun to plan a canal through the Isthmus of Andagoya – if constructed, it would change the fate of commerce and perhaps the world, and bring untold riches to whoever controlled it. Therefore the time has come to recover our former western lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That dream has proven elusive, with obstacles of geography and political discord proving all but insurmountable. Yet surmount them we have, at long last! Jose de Herrera always knew this day would come, and now we shall bring forth the union of north and south. Viva la Gran Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
accept_afro_latinos_rocafuerte_title;Integrate the Afro-Latinos;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_afro_latinos_rocafuerte_desc;Rocafuerte has been a fierce enemy of slavery and ally of Black New Granadans since he began his rebellion. It is commonly believed - though he has refused to ever address the subject - that he himself is a mulatto, with at least one of his ancestors having African blood. His guerilla army emphasized recruiting escaped or freed slaves. Therefore it is only natural that we pass new laws to integrate the Black population of New Granada. This will involve imposing hiring quotas for government agencies, banning racial discrimination by businesses, and directing investments to Black communities. It will take many years to fully accomplish but in time we shall erase the color line dividing Blacks from our society.;;;;;;;;;;;
de_blanco_revenge_title;The Day of Reckoning;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
de_blanco_revenge_desc;Guillermo de Blanco remembers well the black day when his greatest hero, Jose “El Liberador” de Herrera, was struck down on the battlefield by the forces of Washkar Inca. He still bears the scars of that battle, still feels the humiliation of defeat. Every day since then, he has kept one thought constantly in his mind : revenge. Revenge against Washkar. Against the Inca Empire. Against the entire Indian race of Ameriga. It is a thought which has devoured every other aspect of his personality, but now, finally, he has a chance to enact his vengeance. Quito is fighting for its life against the Inca. The situation provides an excellent pretext for New Granada to intervene, and for de Blanco to settle the blood debt which was incurred when El Liberador was cast from his saddle all those years ago. The only question is, will he come as Quito’s savior? Or its master?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLM_apache_title;Taming North Apacheria;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLM_apache_desc;Apacheria proper is under our control, but certain bands of Apache have moved northward, beyond our reach, to preserve their nomadic “empire.” So long as they continue to plague our settlers and our communities, our frontier will not be secure. We must press north and bring these restless Indians to heel, and in doing so claim these virgin lands for ourselves. Better us than the Cadiens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballivian_return_title;Negotiate Unification with Quito;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballivian_return_desc;With the Inca threat eliminated, Ballivian’s power in Quito is now unrivalled, yet he is also in our debt. While de Blanco would never seek to extort his dear friend, the fact remains that we would be far stronger together than separate. Thankfully, Ballivian has proven open to negotiation. He is willing to organize a “mostly fair” referendum on the question of annexation into New Granada, and the result would likely be favorable. In return, he would be allowed to govern Quito proper for as long as he pleases, and Quitenese cultural rights would be enshrined in law. Though some are disturbed by the amount of power that Ballivian desires, it seems a small price to pay for the bloodless unification of Hispanic Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
