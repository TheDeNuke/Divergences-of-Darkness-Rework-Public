#####lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century that had been utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership. As such, Liberalism has never been seen as important as it was in OTL and unless another revolution were to occur it may never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#####500000.T;Venice wants to buy Durrës;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#####500000.D;The city of Durrës has a history of Venetian control. Interspersed with Serbian, Epirote, Anjou and Albanian control, Venice controled the city. Gained after the Fourth Crusade, but lost soon after. In 1392 the city was recaptured and only being lost in 1501 when the expanding Ottomans conquered the city. With the Ottomans gone, Venice is now looking to regain the city. Whilst we do need the money, it is clear that the loss of our major port would mean the influence of Venice upon our country would become even more massive. Were we to accept, soon, we will loose our independence all together.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANI1.D;900 years ago Vinland was discovered and named by Leif Erikson, son of the settler of Greenland, Erik the Red, after he had seen wild grapes on the shore he landed. While much of his life is unknown apart from some unreliable sagas, and the Vinlanders of old gone, the figure of Leif has been hailed as a national hero since the times of the first settlers. With no precise day for the discovery except that it was fall, the date of Leif's Day was settled by the Vinlandic Parliament to be celebrated on the day before the anniversary of the independence of Vinland on the 17th September. All years the 17th and 18th September are days of celebrations and pride for all people of Vinland. But to mark the canonial date, a replica of a Viking ship has sailed from Iceland to Erikshavn where his arrival was met with an immense and joyous crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAF2D;Fishing has been the lifeblood for many in the North Sea. It's plentiful bounty, been competed for from generations of fisherman. But although such is the waters plenty, it has never been without it's territorial ambition.\nIn Trondheim, this was seen today, as a large fishing fleet of Scottish Fishers had came to port, only to be met with anger and fiery words by local Fisherman, who have sworn the Scottish were poaching upon their healthy waters. Words became blows, blows became fights, fights became riots.\nBy the end of the night, the port was rushing with action of a more violent nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUSF1.T;History of Russia from the Earliest Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF1.D;Mikhail Godanin has eventually published the last of the 31 volumes of his History of Russia, considered by many its magnum opus. Son of a former serf, Godanin managed throughout his life to rise through his academic brilliance and his knowledge of the new Western historical methods. His History of Russia is notable for its disdain and refute of the so-called Normanist theory. Many Western historians who had worked on the history of Russia before had noticed the importance of the Northmen in the build of the Rus. But Godanin has demonstrated that this was but a Scandinavian fabrication: Riourik he affirms was a Slav or a Finn, but not a Northman. Moreover, the Russians were already building their own state, and the Rurikids only unified and accelerated the historical process despite the marauding Varangians. This book has become the new Bible of the intellectuals in Russia and has helped nourish the already existing bad blood between Copenhagen and the Eastern Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This social custom was never mandatory despite the rumours that some fools in Western Europe wrote that the Princes in Russia had their nobles forcefully shaven.  It was merely an attempt from the Russian elites to grow closer to Western aristocracy following their European tours in the late XVIIIth century, and allowed them to differentiate them quite easily from the common folk. Now the beard is seen as a Slavic symbol, showing that the elites have not abandoned their roots and understand the glory of the Russian people and its past. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

##### Avignon Crisis ( Coded by DeNuke and Localized by Zerzura )##############;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.T;Triumph in Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.D;Our invasion of Tuscany was a risky gamble, but luck seems to finally be returning to the House of Valois-Medici. The Tuscans have been reconquered, and for better or worse their elites have accepted our return. Of course, the first order of business was to reassure all of the local lords that they’d be able to keep their powers and privileges so long as they cooperated. The acquisition of Tuscany opens up the rest of Italy to our grand dynasty, and the methods of integration we have practiced here will go a long way towards helping us bring more of Italy under Valois rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL5.A;Italy shall belong to the Valois-Medicis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.T;An Argument in Marselha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.D;In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War that raged through Italy, Tuscan monarchists crowned a cousin of the King of Provence as Duke of Lucca in an attempt to offer up Lucca to our dynasty in exchange for surrendering our claim to Tuscany. However, our monarch refused to accept this deal and so Lucca has existed in an awkward situation for years. Now, we have attempted to persuade the Lucchesi Valois-Fourcalquiers to return to our fold, but they seem unwilling to listen. After inviting the Duchess of Lucca to Marselha to argue our case, she retorted that Lucca was “not an appendage of Provence.” The argument ended with the king declaring that he could take Lucca “at dawn and be sitting down for breakfast in the Palazzo Ducale with the sun barely risen into the sky.” Unsurprisingly, the duchess departed Marselha shortly afterward in poor spirits. A confrontation with Lucca – and whichever backers it manages to acquire – is now likely imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL6.A;As if Lucca could find anyone important enough to back them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.T;Provençal Threats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.D;A recent diplomatic incident involving the king of Provence and our own duchess has now escalated to frightful proportions. Lucca was given to the Valois-Fourcalquiers to placate the King in France’s desire for Tuscany. Now the House of Valois is now pressing its claim to our duchy, and if we cannot find anyone to defend us then our independence may be lost. The main hope now is to turn to the Pope for assistance. The Comtats of Avignon and Venaissin have for centuries been a sword of Damocles hanging over the Provençals – a form of Papal insurance against their adventurism. Now we have called upon the Holy Father to dismiss their claim to Lucca and hopefully mobilize political support across Italy against them. If the Papacy has lost their influence in Avignon, however, then we may be out of options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL7.A;Let us pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.T;Showdown in Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.D;For centuries, the House of Valois has claimed both France and vast swathes of Italy, even though they only controlled Provence. However, the recent Valois-Medici seizure of Tuscany – and the pugnacious nature of the “King in France” – has sparked a crisis between them and the Valois-Fourcalquiers-ruled Lucca. The Lucchesi ambassador explained that the Provençals, after a diplomatic row with the duchy, are now attempting to press their old claim to it. Obviously, Provençal expansion in Italy would be a disaster, but ability to prevent it hinges upon use of the Pope’s influence, especially our enclave in the Comtats of Avignon and Venaissin. If for some reason the Pope’s authority, in Roma or Avignon, has dissipated, then there is little we can realistically do to stop the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL8.A;We cannot allow a Valois Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.T;An Unfortunate Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.D;To the embarrassment of our ministers, it seems that our political situation makes it infeasible to protect Lucca from the Provençals. At this point all we can do is steel ourselves for the new tide of war which the foreigners shall surely bring to the rest of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL9.A;God have mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.T;The March on Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.D;The Lucchese attempted to call upon the Pope to organize a coalition of Italian states against us, but this foolish endeavor died on the vine. With Lucca defenseless, our sovereign made good on his threat and launched a rapid conquest of the duchy. Soon enough, the Lucchese royal family fled, our king was having his morning breakfast in the Palazzo Ducale, and the city-state was added to our domain. With our position in Italy consolidated, and all our regional rivals divided, the way is clear for the full restoration of the House of Valois-Medici in Italy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL10.A;Another step on the road to glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.T;The Lucchesi Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.D;The Valois-Medici conquest of Tuscany was bad enough, but their aggression towards Lucca threatens to draw the whole of Italy into war. If we do not take a stand against the foreigners, then the states of the north may soon pass into foreign dominion once more. The Holy Father and his advisors have put their minds together and developed a plan to contain them. We shall first demand that the Provençals stand down and concede to the illegitimacy of their claim to Lucca, effectively dooming any chance of the Valois-Medicis continuing their Italian expansion. If they refuse, then we shall excommunicate their king and set the restoration of an independent Tuscany as their penance. Meanwhile, we will organize a coalition of Italian states to prepare to oppose Provence on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.A;The Valois-Medicis must be expelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL11.B;On second thought, I never liked Lucca much, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.T;The Pope Dismisses Our Claim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.D;The Papacy has long opposed any effort by our great dynasty to expand its power within Italy, and they show no sign of changing any time soon. At the urging of the traitorous Fourcalquiers, the Pope has declared our claim to Lucca to be illegitimate! This announcement has already stirred popular agitation between Catholics and secularists. While it seems that His “Holiness” may be willing to tolerate our presence within Tuscany alone, accepting his intervention would amount to giving up all further aims in Italy. If we press on, however, then the Pope will likely escalate the situation. Excommunication and a military confrontation could both be on the table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.A;And how many divisions does he have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL12.B;Perhaps we were not meant to rule Italy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.T;The Unthinkable Reply;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.D;Provence has flatly rejected any attempt to annul their claims! This unprecedented defiance has sent all of Roma into an uproar. If the Provençals will not see reason, then we must resort to harsher measures. His Holiness has now proclaimed the excommunication of the “King in France,” placing Provence under interdict, and has demanded the immediate evacuation of all Provençal possessions in Italy. If they refuse once again, then we will have no choice but to make manifest the wrath of God upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL13.A;How dare they question the Lord’s representative on Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.T;The Papal Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.D;Our rejection of Papal intervention was not received well in Roma. The Pope has now placed the Kingdom of Provence under interdict. While the announcement was dressed up in flowery language, this is obviously an extortive measure to compel us to abandon Italy. If we do not wish to see Tuscany fall under Papal control, and our ambitions in Italy die an ignominious death, then we shall inflame the Catholic and Italian worlds with our defiance. It is likely that the Pope would muster a coalition of Italian states against us – none of their rulers seem to realize the benefits of enlightened Valois-Medici rule. As a precaution, we would also need to pressure the Public Council of Avignon to declare independence, in order to shore up our defenses against the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.A;Alea iacta est!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL14.B;This was all a misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.T;A Mistake, Corrected at Last;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.D;The Public Council has finally broken the Papal stranglehold on Avignon. As it would not do to have an independent state in the middle of our territory, we have taken the liberty of sending in a column of troops to restore order in the city. After hundreds of years, the blight within the center of Provence has been wiped clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL16.A;Not a day too soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.T;Rebels Storm Avignon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.D;The Protestant fervor sweeping our lands has greatly animated the southeasterners, who have long endured the onerous presence of the Papal enclave of the Duchy of Avignon. This unsightly product of feudal machinations has stood for centuries as a symbol of Papal interference amongst the Provençals. Now, at the encouragement of local agitators, multiple groups of Provençal rebels have descended upon Avignon. The ducal garrison hurriedly escorted the religious authorities out of the city through a series of old siege tunnels, spiriting them into Torino as Avignon fell into anarchy. It is expected that the duchy will soon request annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL17.A;We should have expected this. The Pope won’t take this well…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.T;Avignon Petitions for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.D;With the clerical authorities cast out of Avignon, the Public Council bowed to the pressure of the rebels. They first declared independence, before submitting an official request for annexation to our government. At this point it would cause more political chaos to refuse than to accept – the city is, after all, essentially under occupation by crowds of Protestant zealots. However, the reaction from the Papacy has been one of rage. Retribution from Roma will soon be forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL19.A;Let us enjoy reunification while we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.T;Trouble in Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.D;Our unsanctioned elimination of Valois-Medici Provence has greatly angered His Holiness the Pope. For centuries, Provence existed in a state of uneasy equilibrium with the Papacy and its Duchy of Avignon. The Pope and the Medicis may not have been on friendly terms, but Provence kept Avignon stable. Now the violent destruction of the Provençal nation has plunged Avignon into turmoil and the duchy is likely to collapse. Already, reports are coming in of Provençal agitators calling for the storming of Avignon, and many ecclesiastical personnel have already been evacuated to Roma or Turin. If Avignon falls, then the Pope may take extreme measures to protect his influence in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL20.A;This is ridiculous, it’s just one city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.T;The Fall of Avignon-Venaissin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.D;The Public Council of Avignon-Venaissin, faced with an angry mob threatening the realm, declared independence from the Papacy. Yet this was not enough to appease them, and our soldiers arrived to find the mob running wild through the comtat. We put down this chaos, but the complete collapse of the previous administration left us no legitimate authority to place back in control. Therefore, we have occupied Avignon-Venaissin, awaiting whatever retribution the Pope shall bring against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL22.A;What a mess…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.T;The Avignon Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.D;The Comtat of Avignon-Venaissin – a Papal possession since 1348 and one of the main defenses against Anglois or Provençal expansion into Italy – has fallen. All order in the comtat has collapsed, its clerical administration has fled, and the enclaving power has annexed it. His Holiness the Pope is beside himself with fury, as this is both a grave insult to the Church and a dangerous sign of French designs on Italy. To address the crisis, the Pope will invite Italian representatives to the town of Anzio to form a coalition against this intrusion and lead a military response. Avignon may have fallen, but Roma must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL23.A;Gather the banners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.T;Formation of the League of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.D;The fall of Avignon has enraged His Holiness the Pope, and has sent a wave of fear across Italy. The duchy was typically seen as a check on western aggression into Italy, and its loss augurs ill for us. To defend against this new threat, the Holy Father has summoned representatives from across the Italian region to the Papal town of Anzio, to form a political and military alliance. If we join then we will be expected to fight against the foreigners when the time comes, and our connections to the Papacy will deepen. Rejecting such a proposal will not only harm our relations with the Pope but may endanger our independence if the alliance goes to war without us and fails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.A;We shall send a representative to Anzio and join the League.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL24.B;Our soldiers are not Papal condotierri!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL25.T;Formation of the League of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL25.D;News has reached us of the Pope organizing a coalition of Italian states against us. Representatives from across Italy convened in the town of Anzio to form a military alliance aimed at removing our ability to “threaten” Italy. This is absurd slander – we are, of course, in no way a “threat” to Italy – but several nations throughout Italy have rallied to the Pope’s cause. A war for the fate of Italy is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL26.T;The Tuscan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL26.D; The Provençal invasion of Tuscany was a brutal assault upon the freedom of the whole peninsula, and their crimes against Avignon cannot go unanswered. Now, the time has come at last to confront the Valois and drive them out of Italy! The League of Anzio has been assembled, and we have all prepared our forces for the struggle against the Provençal menace. As armies from the Alpine foothills to the shores of Terracina march towards Firenze, they go with the knowledge that they are the only defense standing between their homelands and the Valois tyrants!

VAL29.D;The greatest tragedy since the coming of the Plantagenets has befallen our once-proud dynasty. The League of Anzio has conquered Tuscany and forced us to render it up to them, spelling the end of all our claims in Italy. All Italian elites who had previously sworn fealty to the rightful King of France have now repudiated their vassalage and broken away, and Tuscany proper has been placed under Papal control, for the Holy Father and his advisors to determine its fate. With our tremendous weakness, and the continued Papal interdict against us, there is nothing to stop the hated House of Plantagenet from attacking us now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL30.D;The Valois-Medici have been cast out of Italy! The armies of the League of Anzio swept into Tuscany and liberated it, before driving all the Provencal forces back over the Alps. The King of Provence, fearful that the Dual Monarchy might take advantage of their weakness to strike, conceded to our demands to relinquish Tuscany and forfeit all Provençal claims in Italy. Tuscany is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will need to decide its fate. Unfortunately, Avignon seems to be permanently lost, but the end of Valois-Medici ambitions in Italy was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL31.T;Valois-Medici Dominion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL31.D;The defeat of the Provençals by the League of Anzio has resulted in several punitive terms being imposed upon Provence.

VAL32.D;The House of Valois-Medici stands tall over all of Italy! The machinations of the Pope came to nothing – his band of brigands was shattered by the might of the Provencal military. Our forces entered Roma, Lucca, and the other cities of northern Italy in triumph. Sensing the prevailing political winds, many Italian elites have sworn fealty to the king in Marselha, while others find their realms descending into turmoil. More and more Italians are beginning to speak of the House of Valois as the best hope for Italian unification, and the new laws passed by the Estates General to protect local Italian codes and customs will go a long way to supporting that argument. Italy has never been closer to our grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The League of Anzio has been assembled, and we have all prepared our forces for the struggle against the Occitans. As armies from the Alpine foothills to the shores of Terracina march towards Marselha, they go with the knowledge that they are fighting for the honor and the dignity of Catholics and Italians everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

All our claims to the old bastion of the House of Valois-Medici have been annulled, and Provence has been placed under Papal control, for the Holy Father and his advisors to determine its fate.

Provence is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will soon need to decide its fate.

Facing overwhelming defeat, the leaders of the League were forced to back down and recognize Occitan independence. Furthermore, the Pope himself has declared the extinction of the Kingdom of Provence, rendering all Valois, Plantagenet, and Serna claims to it null and void. After centuries of persecution, the Occitan people are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The king of the Dual Monarchy, fearful that separatists might take advantage of their weakness to strike, conceded to our demands to relinquish Provence and all of their claims to it. Provence is now in the hands of the Papacy, and the Holy Father will soon need to decide its fate. Unfortunately, neither the new residents of Avignon nor its old administrators seem disposed towards resurrecting the duchy, but the punishment of the Anglois imperialists was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL42.D;La victoire est à nous! The machinations of the Pope came to nothing – his band of brigands was shattered by the might of the Royal Anglois military. Facing overwhelming defeat, the leaders of the League were forced to back down and recognize our annexation of Provence. Though certain Valois and Serna nobles abroad maintain claims to the kingdom, and the incident has struck the first sparks of a Provençal nationalist movement separate from the Occitans, the Italians shall not raise their hands to contest our rule of the southeast again. The Hundred Years’ War is finally over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL42.A;The ghost of the fourteenth century has been exorcised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.T;The Fate of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.D;With Provence now in our hands, there is the question of what to do with it. Occupation has been ruled out due to the exorbitant costs involved – even restoring Avignon-Venaissin would result in establishing a territory whose local population would be overwhelmingly hostile to its existence. Therefore, we have two options. The first option is to return Provence to the House of Valois, on the condition that they waive all claims to lands outside of Provence proper and accept a constitution curtailing royal power. The second option is to bestow Provence upon its Aragonese claimant of the House of Serna. Several advisors have objected to this idea, worrying that it would place Italy under the threat of a new tyrant, but it would certainly put Aragon into our good graces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.A;Restore an independent kingdom of Provence under the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL45.T;The Donation of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.D;A truly unexpected windfall has just graced the Kingdom of Aragon, courtesy of His Holiness the Pope! The House of Valois-Medici, former rulers of the Kingdom of Provence, were driven out, only for the new occupiers of Provence to earn the ire of the Papacy. The Pope then marshalled northern Italy under his banner in the League of Anzio and succeeded in seizing Provence proper. Unwilling to rule it himself, and distrusting the other claimants, he has bestowed the entire Kingdom upon our House of Serna! Provence stands ready for a suitable relative to be named its ruler under Aragonese overlordship. The entire court is jubilant at the news, though the king seemed utterly shocked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL46.T;Avignon Rumors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.D;The shifting political situation in western Europe has seen its ripples reach an unexpected place : the Comtat of Avignon-Venaissin. Formally a possession of His Holiness the Pope, the troublesome enclave has long been a refuge of commerce, minorities, and enemies of the Crown. However, word has reached Marselha that the situation in the comtat is reaching a crisis point. Increasing numbers of Provençal nationalists are pushing for the territory’s incorporation within our nation, but the Pope has made it clear that such an occurrence would be unacceptable. Nobody knows what will happen next but all signs point to Avignon’s days being numbered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.A;A tense situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.T;The Collapse of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.D;It was not surprising to hear that Avignon’s government had been overrun by Provençal nationalists. With unrest threatening to boil over within the city, the ecclesiastical and military authorities, along with the local aristocracy, fled the duchy in droves. As a result, Avignon was seized by Provençal loyalists who have now petitioned for annexation. The flight of the ruling class gave us little option but to accept, yet this incident has enraged the Pope. Rumors swirl that he may goad the Dual Monarchy to attack us in revenge…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.A;We shall stand ready to face the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.T;The Pope Denies Our Claim to France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.D;The Papacy has long opposed any effort by our great dynasty to expand its power, and they show no sign of changing any time soon. At the urging of the Plantagenets, the Pope has declared our claim to France illegitimate! This announcement has already stirred popular agitation between Catholics and secularists. We have now gone too far to turn back and must press forward for fear of popular revolt if we retreat. Preparations for war against both the Anglois and the Pope must be made, and part of that includes a preemptive strike upon Avignon-Venaissin. The road ahead will be rough and arduous, but if we prevail then we may be able to finally conclude the Hundred Years’ War in our favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.A;To Avignon we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.T;The March on Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.D;The Comtat of Avignon, while possessing some fortifications, has never been able to withstand a siege completely surrounded by hostile territory. Our forces were able to quickly surround and storm the territory with minimal loss of life. As of now, the Provençal flag flies over Avignon. Now, we must prepare for the inevitable Papal retaliation – one which shall likely include the Plantagenets as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.A;The calm before the storm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.T;The Ultimate Insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.D;The day long feared by Papal authorities has finally come to pass : Provence has launched a preemptive strike on Avignon, rapidly overrunning and occupying the comtat. The news of this unprovoked assault has enraged His Holiness, who immediately decreed the excommunication of the King of Provence and placed the kingdom under interdict. He went on to declare the title of “King in France” to be illegitimate and has instructed the Papal legate in Paris to solicit Anglois aid. In fact, the Holy Father has gone so far as to declare the Plantagenets to be the legitimate kings of Provence, and it is expected that the legate will urge the Anglois king to invade immediately. All of these maneuvers have upset liberal Catholics within the Papal States, who do not look fondly upon the Pope using his temporal and spiritual powers for overt political actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.A;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s : render unto God that which is God’s. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.T;The Drums of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.D;The response from Roma to our seizure of Avignon was immediate. First, the king was excommunicated and the entire nation placed under interdict : now, no Provençal citizen can receive communion or partake in any other Catholic rite. The Pope then declared the very title of “King in France” to be illegitimate and proclaimed the Plantagenets to be the sole rightful rulers of Provence! Catholics across Europe have now turned against us, reactionary politicians accuse us of heresy, and the Anglois armed forces are rumored to be mobilizing. Our influence across Italy has collapsed, and we should prepare for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL53.A;The Hundred Years’ War continues to haunt us all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL54.T;The Weakness of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL54.D;Recent events in the southeast have opened up an opportunity. Provence’s baseless claiming of the French throne, and their seizure of Avignon, have stirred His Holiness the Pope to take action. After placing the Kingdom of Provence under interdict, his papal legate in Paris has appealed to us to invade the Valois-Medici domain. Declaring the House of Plantagenet to be the sole legitimate claimants to Provence, the Pope has urged us to finish off our old rivals. This is an excellent opportunity, but if we are currently in a crisis of our own then there is no reason that we cannot postpone Provence’s destruction to a more suitable time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Declaring the House of Plantagenet to be the sole legitimate rulers of Occitania, the Pope has urged us to restore our control of the southern lands. §RThis is our best chance to bring order back to the Midi and vanquish the unruly Protestants.

VAL58.T;The Dissolution of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL58.D;The dramatic shift in Roman political conditions has resulted in the catastrophic destabilization of the Comtat of Avignon. With the Pope no longer in firm control and regular contact with the enclave, the territory is becoming a battleground for ethnic and sectarian conflict. Therefore, we have decided to dissolve the government of Avignon and impose direct rule, pending deliberation on the territory’s future. While our ministers are divided as to the best course of action to address the issue of Avignon in the long term, all of them agree that abandoning the duchy to anarchy is not in anybody’s interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL60.T;Assuming Control of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL60.D;Since its purchase from the Neapolitans in 1348 AD, the Comtat of Avignon has been the most distant possession of the Holy See. Now that we have acquired Roma, we have inherited the Pope’s rights and responsibilities towards the territory. However, we may not necessarily want to continue administering an enclave in the middle of Provence. We should therefore consider if it might be more advantageous to sell off Avignon to a suitably friendly and responsible buyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL60.A;We must consider this topic with care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.T;The Sale of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL61.D;$FROM$, the overlords of Avignon, have decided that keeping the duchy under their control is no longer in their interests. They have thus come forward with an offer to allow us to purchase the territory, since it was originally purchased (from the Neapolitans) in the fourteenth century. Considering how politically dangerous the territory has been over the years, the ability to easily obtain it should not be scoffed at. Nevertheless, several of our more bellicose ministers believe that we should simply seize it by laying claim to it and preparing a military campaign. However, these men are in the minority, and most urge our head of state to accept the offer. §B(This will cost roughly 100000)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The city in which the Capetian dynasty, our great ancestors, was born in 987 A.D. has now returned to the hands of its rightful Valois inheritors. With it comes all the French heartland, where the Gauls, Romans, and Franks pooled the strength of their bloodlines to create our glorious people. Now, let our sovereign depart for the Reims cathedral, where all kings of France have been coronated for over one thousand years. When the Archbishop of Reims anoints him King not merely IN France, but OF France, then all our subjects will recognize us as their sole sovereign. Vive la Maison Valois! Vive les vrais rois de France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
reclaim_paris_DUA_title;Return to Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
reclaim_paris_DUA_desc;When the insolent Valois-Medicis stole the French heartland from us, they made a pompous show of crowning their preening monarch as king of France. Now that we have restored our control of France, it is time that we give them a taste of their own medicine. Our sovereign shall be reanointed, and all the Medici loyalists driven out. The royal court, which was forced to relocate in a chaotic scramble to escape the advancing Medici army, shall return in grand triumph to Paris, the crown jewel of civilization and the capital of humanity. Let this be a humiliating lesson to all who would challenge the undeniable supremacy of the House of Plantagenet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

integrate_bretons_desc;For over a thousand years, the Bretons and the French have lived side by side, throughout the rise and fall of multiple dynasties. During this time their culture has become quite like our own, and they have grown connected to many French communities. Our dynasty’s failure to secure victory in the War of the Breton Succession in the fourteenth century, and thus keep the Dukes of Brittany loyal, could be considered our first major defeat during the Hundred Years’ War. Let us correct that mistake and ensure that the Bretons will remain a steadfast and valued component of our domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

liberate_greater_provence_desc;For too long, the nation of Provence has stained the maps of Europe. This unsightly remnant of the House of Valois-Medici’s mediocrity has been a thorn in our side for too long. The political conditions of western Europe are now finally flexible enough that we can afford to remove Provence from the map without fear of retaliation. All of Provence must belong to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

clean_up_italy_minors_desc;Our campaign to ensure Valois-Medici hegemony in Italy continues apace, but Lucca, Parma, and Modena all stand in our way. Individually, they are insignificant, but combined they may prove to be a hassle. We must prevent them from hampering our endeavors against the larger powers in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

clean_up_italy_milan_desc;Milan is the grandest city of Lombardia, and one which has often vexed would-be rulers of Italy. Notorious for punching above its weight, if it is left to its own devices then its nascent industrialization could make it a problem. We must bring it under our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_pope_title;Subjugate the Papacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_pope_desc;One of the greatest errors in European history was Frankish king Pepin the Short legitimizing the Pope’s slow takeover of the region surrounding Roma. Ever since 756 A.D., the Pope’s temporal power as ruler of the Papal States has kept Italy fractured and weak for his own benefit. This can no longer be tolerated. We might be Catholics, but the days of theocracy and bending the knee to spiritual powers are over. The time has come to liberate central Italy, and reclaim Roma, the Eternal City, for the rightful rulers of Italy : the House of Valois-Medici.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_genoa_savoy_title;Subjugate Genoa and Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_genoa_savoy_desc;The two main powers of northwestern Italy, Genoa and Savoy, both threaten our efforts to unify Italy for different reasons. Genoa’s maritime and economic power, while a sliver of its medieval might, is nevertheless a rival to our hegemony. Meanwhile, Savoy possesses one of the largest land armies in Italy, not to mention a robust and slowly industrializing economy. Both of these states must be made to recognize the House of Valois-Medici’s right to rule Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_savoyard_title;Subjugate Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
clean_up_italy_savoyard_desc;Piedmont represents a significant threat to our efforts to unite Italy. Combining the economic reach of Genoa with the industrial and population strength of Savoy, they are a significant rival for the leadership of the Italian states. Most relevant is the direct threat which their geographical position poses to Provence proper. Bringing them under our control, however, will make our power in Italy all but unassailable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##### Inca (Attalus) ##############;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.T;The Inca claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.D;Quiso Yupanqui was destined to rule the Inca empire as the first born of Huascar III. However his cowardice in the battle of Lima saw him discredited at court, many blaming him for the defeat. He was thus exiled and his uncle Huayna Capac IV was crowned in his stead. For 11 years we have hosted him in Camelot, granting him a small allowance but recently he has grown restless about taking back the throne of the Inca. Reports talk about unrest from the chieftains following the reforms of the Imperial court, and the ilness of the usurper. Quiso has demanded we help him arm his supporters so he could take back what is ours, and ensuring a more friendly, if not open to new ideas neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC2.T;The coup of Quiso Yupanqui!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC2.D;After years of exile in Beornia, the coward son of Huascar III who commanded the right wing of the Incan army in the battle of Lima and who fled following the charge of the Herrera cavalry has come back to the capital with Beornian guns. Striking by surprise he hopes to take back the throne with the support of many conservative nobles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC2.B;Quiso Yupanqui and his partisans are stopped and killed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.T;The coronation of Quiso Qapac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.D;The coup has succeeded. Quiso himself slaughtered the usurper and his son despite the formidable defense of the Chinu guard and its commander, the Ronin Oishi Chikara. All administrators were interrogated, with the Qingqiuan Yiang Jujiu minister and first preceptor of the Prince executed for betraying the Empire in favour of the foreigners. The country soon rallied around his true ruler who has promised to uphold the natural balance of the Andine society, reverting several modernization reforms of his predecessors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC3.A;Long live Quiso Qapac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.T;The Great Andine Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.D;The Inca empire in the Andes is suffering from a great famine following an outbreak of potato blight. Potatoes have suffered in the past from diseases, but never on such a scale and the inefficient and closed governement of Quiso Capac has only worsened the situation. All around the empire the peasants turn to the God of the Sun to relieve them of their pains but so far no sign of amelioration has been seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC6.D;As the famine spreads to Antisuyu the port of Uraycusta, the "gate of the Empire" has seen the local Aimara inhabitants riot against the foreigners accused of harboring grain to make a profit. The Qingqiuans, the more numerous were the most hit with the Chinese quarter reduced to ashes with hundreds of its inhabitants. Japanese and Anglois traders were also targeted in the attack, the crowd nearly attacking the diplomatic quarter before the intervention of the local police and foreign guards opened fire on the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC6.A;Will the disasters never end ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.T;Opportunities in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC7.D;The disastrous administration of Quiso Qapac has led to a grave famine in the Andes. The empire of the Inca is weakened as bodies pile throughout the Andine villages and their soldiers are weakened by their hunger. Back in the XVIIth century the adventurer Edward Pitt had tried to conquer a port in the Pacific only to be met by death but now we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC8.D;An envoy from Camelot has traveled to the Imperial capital to deliver a simple message : cede the southern provinces to the Beornians or they will be taken by force. The famine and unstability have weakened Tawantinusuy and it might be better if we caved in rather than try to delay the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC10.T;Colonization of the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC10.D;The conquest of New-Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that they had 'saved' the Aimara inhabitants of the Southern Andes from the famine. New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions as they hosted several foreign communities, and shipments of food flooded the port. However the campaigns outside never saw much of it as Beornian bureaucrats took lands by force from the inhabitants. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accaparate land for future colonization with countless tribes pushed to the North. When the Beornians did not act, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC12.A;Beornia has nothing to excuse for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.T;The first Imperial assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.D;One of the reforms pushed by Pachacuti II was the establishment of an Assembly to represent the people of the Empire in governance. It first convened in $YEAR$, with a Lower Chamber elected by the various Ayllus of the Empire and a Senate appointed by the Emperor. The campaigns voted by villages with no individual votes cast, while in the Imperial cities only those who payed the 'poll tax' could vote. The first Inca constitution while deeply influenced by the European and Japanese models, retained several of the particularities of the Empire and established the so-called era of the 'advised Sapa Incas'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.A;The voice of the people is the will of the Inka!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.T;The gate of the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.D;Following the loss of the Inka homeland to the Spanish, the Empire strenghtened its hold on the South. In the southern valley of the new Antisuyu the bay of Uraycusta was first developed by Dongese who had acquired trading privileges following the establishment of the Chinu guard. Following the crossing of Land's End and the treaty of Bordeaux that saw the Anglois gain access to Potosi silver, Uraycusta grew even further. Eventually by the XVIIIth century and the arrival of the Japanese traders in the region, it had been nicknamed the 'Gate of the Inca' by outsiders as this was the only port accessible to foreigners. The reforms of Pachacuti targeted the city the city plan was reorganized and the city was given self governance like the Imperial capital, free from the Southern Apu (governor) as to encourage foreign investments and settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.A;Let the world come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.T;Rice farming in Antisuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.D;Rice was brought to the knowledge of the Inca following the arrival of Dongese merchants and adventurers in the late XIVth century but cultivation was sporadic as few Ayllus and administrators wanted to cultivate this new plant. But in Antisuyu the climate has revealed itself as a good match for the plant and the Asiatic and Qingqiuan presence in the city meant that the cereal was in demand. In the 1840's Pachacuti II, who was a well known consumer of rice, developed great infrastructure projects to enlarge the production of rice in the South. This effort led to an increase of food that allowed the Empire to avoid disaster during the Potato blight of the late 1840's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.A;Rice for the people (and the Inka)!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.D;The only diplomatic tool that the Empire had following the conquest of Cuzco was the great silver mines of the Andes and especially Potosi. While payments to the Spanish were stopped as soon as the Colombian wars began, the Anglois fleet still continued to come every 4 years to take its due. Pachacuti II arranged following his coronation for a diplomat to be sent to Paris to end the treaty to show its regained independence. The Anglois accepted as their reliance on silver had been reduced thanks to Atlantian and Qingqiuan gold flooding the markets with only the payment for $YEAR$ to be done. Now the Silver fleet has left the port of Uraycusta for the last time, with a day of celebrations in the empire for the end of European colonialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.A;Tawantinsuyu will not be exploited anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.D;The Dual-Monarchy had gained access to the Potosi silver in the XVIIth century, securing payments of silver in exchange for guarantees of the Inca Empire continued independence. As silver became less of a necessity thanks to the various Gold rushes, the interest of the Silver fleets declined for Anglois elites. Following the accession of the new Incan emperor Pachacuti II, diplomats agreed to end the old treaty of Bordeaux in exchange for a last shipment and preferential relations with the new 'civilized state';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.A;It was good while it lasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.T;The Great Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.D;Before the arrival of the Conquistadors the Incan economy was not based on individual property and markets, but on the basis of reciprocity between individuals, but also inside the Empire as a whole. The corvée, or mit'ma, was in theory based on the fact that in bad times the emperor would help the communities who worked for him. This system was brutally changed by the Conquest and the spread of European thoughts as the chieftains acquired more lands from the community for themselves. Pachacuti invested several administrators to the creation of a modern cadaster and the end of nobility hegemony on land possession. The mit'ma was also formally abolished. The Ayllus were left with a choice : the lands were divided between the various families of the villages or instituted as common land possessed by the entire village. A mixed system of landowning prevailed after the reforms, granting far more power to the peasant communities than before and ensuring a greater food production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.A;Lands owned by communes, what a strange idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.T;Feeding the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.D;The various reforms of Pachacuti and the adoption of foreign and modern agricultural techniques allowed the Empire to grow far more food than before, accompanying the growth of population. The Empire while not controlling the food market as before still exerted great influence over the merchants, instituting maximum prices during times of hunger and ensuring redistribution of food for isolated communities in periods of drought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.A;Our people is fed and growing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.T;Ending the colonial system;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.D;The reconquest of old imperial lands up to Quito proved to be a major problem for the Empire of the Sun. The economy was controlled by the Granadan and catholic Quechua elites who abused the rural communities to gain more wealth. In the same time the Catholic faith proved to be hard to manage as bishops rallied the masses against the 'Heathen invaders' adoring idols and devils. To counterract both of these problems, the land reform that had been instituted in the Southern Andes was extended to Peru, with the resisting landowners being put to trial or even murdered in riots where the injustice was the worst. Meanwhile the Catholic masses grew less poor thanks to the Inka, securing the loyalty of the rural communities. The land reform disrupted the economy of the Central Andes for nearly two decades as production had to be reorganized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.A;Colonization has ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.T;Renew the Chinu alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.D;The relations between the Qingqiuese and the Empire of the Sun go back to the XVth century when a Dongese ship landed near Quito, bringing the lost Chinese colonists in contact with their first non-hostile state after the disaster of Acapulco. Soon after disgruntled mercenaries from Dong Guo arrived to settle in the empire bringing variolation, gunpowder and mettalurgy to the Empire and forming the 'Chinu Guard', critical to the continued independence of the Inca Empire. After his accession to the throne Pachacuti II sent several ambassies to San Bao to rekindle their long friendship and secure a renewed alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.A;The Alliance must be reforged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.B;We don't need the Qingqiuese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.T;Embassy from the Empire of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.D;The Inca empire was the first non-hostile state the Chinese colonists encountered in the New-World, with Dongese ships avoiding the coast of Mexico following the slaughter of several crewmen in the bay of Acapulco. The Inca Empire brought food and ressources to the lost colonists, and many settled there, with also plenty of sailors marrying with Quechua women during their trips. The new era of Pacific navigation in the XVIIth century allowed the Qingqiuese to transport the Inca silver to China, greatly securing their trade adventures and ensuring the development of Qingqiu as it exists today. The reasons for allying the Inca are numerous and their ambassadors are ready to sign it as soon as we want it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.A;Long live the Pacific alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC22.B;We don't need them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
humala_mission_title;Humala Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
humala_mission_desc;The Humala Mission or Humala Embassy was an Inca diplomatic journey to Japan, initiated in $YEAR$ by the Imperial court. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Inca and the establishment of lasting relations between the two Empires of the Sun. It was first proposed by the influential head of the Chinu Guard Oishi . The purposes of the mission were twofold: To negotiate commercial treaties to increase trade in the Pacific and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from Japan who was considered as a model of successful and independent modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC23.T;The Humala mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC23.D;In $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ hosted the Humala mission, an embassy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that aimed to negotiate new trade treaties and gather knowledge to assist them in their modernization. The chief of the embassy, Huascar Humala received an imperial audience and attracted great attention during his stay. While not the first Quechua to set foot in the Home Islands, nor the first embassy sent by the Empire of the Sun to the Empire of the Rising Sun, it sponsored growing ties between the two powers and became a symbol of their modernity for the Japanese elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC24.T;Creation of the Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.D;By $YEAR$, the Inca state had transitioned into a dominated monetized economy. The economy minister implemented the creation of a paper-money backed by the huge silver and gold reserves gathered over the centuries. The money soon proved to be resilient and strong as the local population adopted it and international merchants used it for their Amerigan endeavours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.A;Let the money flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.T;Religion in the new Inca state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.D;The cult of Inti, the sun god, has been the basis of the Inca religion since the foundation of the Empire. The emperors claim descent from Inti, with an old legacy of inbreeding to keep the blood of the god pure. Each ayllu worships huacas, mummified ancestors kept in the Imperial capital, and several other deities of the Andine pantheon. The relocation of the Empire to the South didn't change much as Christianity never truly took because of the tales of Spanish brutalities against the colonized populations of the western provinces. Pachacuti II guaranteed freedom of religion in the hopes of securing the loyalty of the Quechua in Granada and to please the European powers. This created some backlash from some of the religious elite but Pachacuti left all religious decisions to the Willaq Umu, the High Priest of Inti who spent the following years consolidate the Imperial religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.A;Is this still the empire of Inti ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.T;The Inti state religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.D;While the Sapa Inka officially left all religious affairs to the priests of Inti, only performating the rituals required by the tradition following the decision of Pachacuti II, this only strenghtened the cult in the long term. The various Willaq Umu, chosen by the Sapa Inka and reserved by tradition to members of the Imperial family, formalized the relationship between the gods and the Sapa Inka who became even more in the Imperial ideology a divine being who was separate from the rest of his subjects. The various cults of the Andes were left untouched by these changes, as the official religion only took care of the Imperial cults and especially the shrines of Inti. The Inti faith was reenforced by this new movement as the people took part in Inti ceremonies to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire while honoring their huacas and offering sacrifices to their local divinities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC27.D;The first task the Imperial officers prepared for after the reconquest of Cuzco was the preparations for the Festival of the Sun, the greatest ceremony of the Empire performed by the Sapa Inca himself on the winter solstice.

INC28.T;The Koricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.D;Back in the days of the old empire, the Willaq Umu performed their rituals in the golden temple, close to the Imperial palaces and in the true centre of the Empire. The Spanish demolished the temple, only leaving the foundations to build a church on it. While freedom of religion had been proclaimed and the Catholic cult was not persecuted anymore, the Imperial governement demolished the Church of Santo Francesco and planned a new Koricancha to be built. This act while heavily justified to the eyes of the Inti followers was met with rage by the Catholic faithful. The temple took nearly 15 years to be rebuilt, shining with gold and silver and being acclaimed as the herald of the new imperial architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC30.D;For decades the conquest of New-Mercia had been heralded as a great humanitarian project that had allowed civilization to flourish into the uncivilized Andes. But a recent report from a Burgundian missionary, Jean Casemer, who has spent 5 years in Native communities from the Andes has torn this facade apart. Collecting the tales of the great famine and the atrocities done by the Beornian army, he has personally scouted several abandoned villages 'meeting only death' for miles. His report was a blow to Beornian prestige although it did not amount to much as the Beornians never apologized or changed their stance about their Western provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now has come a formidable man, Lars Heyerdhal, a great explorer and commander who has heard of our plights and propose to wage war to recover our lost lands. A council of the main tribes of our country has declared him ‘toqi’, our leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC61.A;Long hail our savior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.T;Reports from the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.D;Troubled reports come from the Mapuche tribes. A man called Lars Heyerdhal coming from Scandinavia has seemingly been able to rally the tribes against our rule. Our contacts in the European embassies know nothing of this man who apparently was just a disillusioned immigrant in Camelot a few months ago. The Scandinavian attaché in Uraycusta pledges that he will get an official statement from his country, but he seems as lost as us on the situation. Our Foreign department is not so pleased by Scandinavian intervention. From their base of Tapt O, they have over the years sent several expeditions in the Southern Cone, and while there has been no official attempt to settle the place, the revolt of the Mapuche could very well be a pretext for Copenhagen to intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.A;What does this settler intends to do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.T;The Kingdom of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC63.D;Strange news come from Southern Ameriga. In two days we have received a demand from clarification from our representative in the Incan Empire and a letter of friendship from the so-called ‘King of Araucania and Patagonia’, Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal. Reports seem to indicate that Lars Heyerdhal was months ago just a worthless subject of the Crown, but he has apparently taken over the Mapuche tribes as their king and want to expel the Incas from their lands. While he seems like a madman, he could serve our interests. Numerous tribes inhabit the Southern Cone : let them unite under a King of our obedience while we settle the Magellan strait. Or we could let the Southerners deal with this delusional King. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC65.D;The letter from the King Karl-Lars has been received warmly by the Foreign department of Copenhagen who has recognized our state as sovereign and rightful. This has been a great honor for the King, who still apparently doesn’t know that a toqi is not the same thing as a King, but translation problems will have to wait for the end of the Inka claims on their territories. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC66.D;What we thought was just a farce has now become a matter of state. The so-called kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia, instituted by the mad Lars Heyerdhal, has been recognized by the Scandinavians who now ask us to retire our troops from the Araucanian territory. Either we recognize the Mapuche claims to independence and risk to see a Scandinavian colony on our southern border in a few years or fight but that will surely means that we will have to face the Scandinavian armies and also navy, along with the resistant Mapuche.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides this conflict, the Beornians have claimed over the years lands in Patagonia despite their old treaties with the Mapuche tribes. With the victory of the Kingdom of Araucania in the West, numerous tribes have proclaimed Karl-Lars their toqi as well in Patagonia. He now asks of us to help him free these tribes from Beornian influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC73.D;We have received a message from the Scandinavian ambassador in Camelot that asks us to accept the claims of the Kingdom of Araucaunia over Patagonia by giving back any lands belonging to the Mapuche tribes we may have annexed in the previous years and settle our border at the Graham river.

INC82.D;The rule of Karl-Lars was always more important in his mind than in reality. Never learning the language of his subjects, he lived in his court proclaiming decisions that never were materialized. Eventually, his behaviour clashed with the Mapuche elders that organized a great gathering in the capital and deposed him as toqi, and sent him back to his homeland. Now they have decided to end the Kingdom of Araucania to proclaim a Republic of the Mapuche people. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC83.T;The establishment of the Araucanian protectorate ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC83.D;Eventually Karl-Lars ideas clashed with his subjects habits. Our ‘good ally’ was ferried back to Copenhagen where he has spent the last days in an apathic state. We could easily convince him to give his royal rights to the King, settle him in a Norwegian fjord and move to annex the Mapuche into our colonial empire. After all, we control their military with their officers trained by our men and supplying them with weapons and ammunition. Or we could recognize the new Republic they have created so that it could serve us as a buffer in Ameriga : after all, the land down there is not that important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC84.D;After the deposition of the adventurer King Karl-Lars by the Mapuche tribes that had elected him, the former sovereign settled in his natal Norway, abdicating his rights to Scandinavia who swiftly decided to impose a protectorate on the Mapuche. Resistance was easily crushed : Scandinavians had explored the territory for years, and knew whose elders could help them in controlling the territory. This brought an end to the shortlived attempt at Mapuche independence as Scandinavia extended its Ildmark colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAV1.T;Basque Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him. What will possibly happen??;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV2.D;The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his dreams of independence. He reasoned that Aragon is decaying and through our historic and cultural ties with the Pamplonan Crown, it is our duty to intervene on his behalf. Yet, our advisors are alarmed: Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead and might retaliate. Nonetheless, Henry IV awaits an answer. Our strength might be enough to scare off Barcelona, but they nonetheless might escalate it into a war. If we don't help Henry IV, Spain might use this chance alone to finally free the Basque from the Aragonese yoke. But we could use this opportunity to gain a client state in Euskadia, although this would anger our long-time friend and ally Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They stormed the Supreme Court in Bilbao, they stormed the forts in the Pyrenees and at our borders to our Iberian brethren and they stormed the royal palace of Pamplona.

To placate Österland once and for all we have been forced to create ten governatorates under Copenhagen's strict control, stripping the Finns of all political autonomy. Only a handpicked minority of loyal Scandinavian nationals retained its official citizenship, replacing Finnish and Karelians in all levels of the local administration. A lot has changed and while Finland may now seem at peace, new ideologies and agitations stir the crestfallen and disaffected inhabitants of the region. To avoid a new Finnish War of Independence we must relinquish our authoritarian rule over Finland and allow natives to have a say over local and national matters by granting them full citizenship.

SCAFIN1.T;The Finnish National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN1.D;The Finnish National Awakening is a long period of political and cultural ferment in Finland and Karelia roughly starting with the publication in 1835 of the Kalevala, a compendium of Finnic oral poetry and legends. Finnic nationalism has spread among the finnish-speaking educated middle class, starting from the foundation in 1838 of the Sampo Society in Borgå as a direct response to the Three Crowns Act. Inner Finland and Karelia have lagged behind due to their rural conformation, but the growing discontent with Scandinavian rule and fears of Russian expansionism have given rise to a distinct Karelian national sentiment of lower class origin. Despite their differences, Finnish and Karelian nationalism share the same ambitions of Finnic unity -for now- and self-rule, unlike the heavily Scandinavianized Ostrobothnian and Helsingforsian nobility, who are loyal to the idea of integral union with the mainland, despite their patronage of Finnish culture. The Finns will soon challenge Copenhagen's indifference and ask to reconsider the status of Finland within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191916.A;Exploiting their weaknesses and divisions will guarantee the unity of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN2.T;The Finns request a National Diet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN2.D;Three weeks ago in Helsingfors, a public debate organized by the nationalist Sampo Society about the proposal to make Finnish a co-official language of Österland has derailed into a full fledged popular consultation regarding Scandinavian rule in the region. Despite the swift dissolution of the assembly by the police, a group of seven intellectuals has written a four page manifesto based on the proposals and the complaints gathered during the consultation. The document has been summarized in a public letter addressed to our sovereign asking to convene a National Finnish Diet to redefine Finland's status within the realm. The letter has been signed by many famous and influential intellectuals and politicians, like Count Jakob Stiernhielm, with the hope of raising awareness among Scandinavian mainlanders about Finland's problems. The Finnic nationalist front is still developing and lacks cohesion, but it's not at all certain that we could get rid of them in one go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN3.T;The National Diet of Helsingfors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.D;170 delegates from all lands belonging to the the Gulf of Bothnia have been convened in the New City Hall of Helsingfors to define Finland's new constitutional order. Thus far, nationalist delegates from Karelia and Southern Finland have formed a "Autonomist" party with the support of some Ostrobothnians deputies who had signed the Petition for a National Diet. All other Ostrobothnians are staunchly opposing every attempt to remove Copenhagen's political control over the activities of the future Senate. As deputies frequently change their official stance from autonomist to conservative and viceversa there's no way to predict who will gain the upper hand. However, the next daily session will be open by our Prime Minister, who will subtly warn Karelian delegates that those who claim to be their ally against the Scandinavian "tyrant" may prove to be far harsher masters. If this manages to put a flea in their ears we might create a rift between the two nationalities. We await future developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191918.A;It will be the pivotal moment of this Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.D;Despite the Prime Minister's barefaced attempt to break the Autonomist front, Finnish and Karelian deputies preserved their political unity for several days, until the reckless suggestion of making Finnish the sole official language of the new nation shifted a sizeable group of moderate Scandinavian-speaking and Karelian deputies towards anti-independence positions. The breakaway group allowed the Ostrobothnian faction to win by a narrow margin a series of crucial votes. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland has been solemnly sent to our monarch by the Diet's President. The Finns will benefit from a less centralised local administration and some economical privileges, but the new Senate will have no effective scrutiny ability over the Copenhagen appointed plenipotentiary, Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson. As the title "Grand-Duchy" suggests, there's no equal political status with the other Nordic kingdoms and foreign affairs are entirely under Scandinavian control. This will not quell the Finns' rumbling for long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191919.A;I dare them to come back asking for more after this unprecedented concession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.D;The Prime Minister's effrontery has had the opposite effect than that expected, strengthening nationalist positions and unity, thus exacerbating the clash between Scandinavian-speaking Ostrobothnians and radicalised independentists. After a fight between two deputies had interrupted a session of the Diet, the Ostrobothnian delegation decide to abandon the Chamber and return home, declaring that they will have nothing more to do with the Finns. The Rump Diet has nonetheless written a surprisingly moderate Constitution for the Kingdom of Finland. Copenhagen will retain substantial control over the Senate and the new National Diet, but the Finnish Army will be completely independent from Scandinavia's. The Helsingforsian nobility mourns the birth of a nation that publicly denounced them as traitors and awaits the time it will return under direct mainlander protection as Ostrobothnia. The Finns got what they wanted, but they won't be able to escape Scandinavian control any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191920.A;With an absolute king this would never have happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.T;The Karelian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.D;After a brilliant speech by our Prime Minister, fight has erupted between Finnish and Karelian nationalists. Divisive questions like the recognition of Karelian language have been brought to the surface, putting at risk the solidarity between Finnic nationalities. Recent votes have shown a steady growth of the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction, but victory can not be claimed yet. The most prominent Finnish delegates are trying to mend this fracture in time for the crucial decisions on the new Senate's powers by promising autonomy and other substantial concessions. In the last few days, however, a pamphlet asking for a separate Karelian Diet has spread like wildfire in Helsingfors. Finnish and Karelian delegates call it a petty provocation, but they can't deny it well represents the feelings of some representatives of the Eastern Frontier. We can only wait until the proceedings of the Diet reach a conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191921.A;They want another Diet?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.T;The Autonomists reconcile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.D;Despite the staunch opposition of Copenhagen's most loyal supporters, the new autonomist Constitution of the Kingdom of Finland has been approved by a wide margin. After the emergence of separatist positions within the Karelian delegation many thought that the fractured Diet would be locked in a stalemate. Instead, the prompt reply of some Finnish nationalists leaders regrouped the Autonomist faction and marginalized the supporters of the "Karelian Diet Petition". The momentum gained by this display of internal cohesion permitted the approval of some radical autonomist proposals, often deleterious for the privileges of Scandinavian-speaking citizens. Copenhagen's control over the Senate and the new National Diet will be minimal. Scandinavia loses a precious piece of its Baltic dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191922.A;This is the end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.T;The Karelian March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.D;The intrinsic contradictions of the Finnic nationalist movement have been exposed, leading to the dissolution of the Autonomist party. Finnish deputies have regrouped and radicalised triggering a similar reaction in the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction. As the polarized Diet approached a stalemate, the authors of the Karelian Diet Petition made themselves public and called for a sabotage of the anti-Karelian Helsingfors Diet. As eastern deputies returned to their constituencies, the Finnish National Diet was dissolved, resulting in bare minimum changes to the status quo. However, as proposed by General Johan Von Ascheberg, Finnish nationalism can be defeated once an for all only if the South and the East stay divided. He therefore proposes the creation of a militarized "Karelian March" to defend our Eastern Frontier and quell all future separatist feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191923.A;A brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.D;Divergences between Finnish and Karelians nationalists have benefited the Ostrobothnian-led conservative party, leading to a rejection of many autonomist proposals. When came the pyrrhic reconciliation of the two nationalities, the most uncompromising Karelian deputies had already teamed up with the moderates, giving them a decisive majority in the Diet. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland was solemnly sent to the monarch by the Diet's President. The Copenhagen-appointed Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson has almost complete control over the legislative process, with the ability to dissolve the new National Diet and nominate ministers at will. His Minister of Defence, General Johan Von Ascheberg, has transferred the control of most of the Eastern Frontier to the Scandinavian army, citing the strategic importance of the region. The Karelians, who hoped to gain a favourable arrangement at the expense of their southern cousins, are now blocked in a situation far worse than the one they started with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191924.A;This solution does not seem destined to last long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.T;The Riksdag of the Estates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.D;After decades of inactivity, the Riksdag of the Estates of Sweden has been convened in the House of Nobility of Stockholm to determine the new status of Österland within the Scandinavian realm. Copenhagen's Landsting has contested the legitimacy of such assembly, whose powers had been delegated de facto to the new unified chamber of the Empire, but an intervention of the Prime Minister made clear that the convocation of a kingdom's estates currently is an inappellable personal prerogative of the Monarch. As deputies from Denmark and Norway had forewarned, the opening of the Riksdag rekindled Stockholm's desire for autonomy and decentralization, transforming the Finnish Question in a challenge to Copenhagen's authority. The constitutional foundations of our nation will undergo drastic changes regardless of the decisions made by the estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191925.A;Scandinavia will forever stand united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.D;A speech by our monarch has officially closed the Riksdag of the Estates, putting an end to the farce of the Swedish barons. The Stockholm assembly was forced to realize its complete lack of effective political powers and the results of its workings can be considered ceremonial, at best. The Grand Duchy of Finland has been carved out of Sweden's territory and as the name suggests its status is not equal compared to the three constituent kingdoms of the Empire. The Copehagen Landsting has had its revenge, but the Riksdag's damage is done and now the Prime Minister has to appoint a Governor-General to formally deal with the powerless National Diet of Finland. The Finns have returned east feeling teased and mortified by the paternalism of the Swedes and they will surely come back asking for more autonomy. Copenhagen must now demonstrate the full capabilities of the central government, maybe by giving exceptional powers to the Governor-General in Helsingfors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191926.A;Carl Anders Torstensson will be our trusted man in Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.T;The Instrument of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.D;Long negotiations with the representatives of the Finnish Estates have lead to the adoption of a new Instrument of Government for the Kingdom of Sweden, officially changing its name to the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Finland. Stockholm celebrated what was widely regarded as the creation of a Swedish Empire within Scandinavia, but the first Finnish-speaking delegates at the Landsting in Copenhagen were vocal in denouncing the paternalism of the Swedes and the absence of true political reform. They officially appealed to the Chamber representing the Empire as a whole asking to grant to all Finns effective citizenship rights and protection, within and outside the borders of the Kingdom. This is the perfect opportunity to reaffirm Copenhagen's authority: we must seize the Finnic lands just across our border and prove once more that our country is strong and united. But if we pursue in our inaction, it won't be just the Eastern Frontier that will search for alternative solutions to our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN13.D;As foretold by months of growing unrest, fighting has erupted in the streets of Helsingfors after a peaceful demonstration of the Sampo Society was dispersed by the police. The popular neighbourhoods are completely out of control and the chief of the city police has been shot while supervising an assault to a barricade. The representative of the Scandinavian government has left the city in secret and is now trying to organize a retaliation from the Sveaborg Fortress, in the nearby archipelago. As the news reached the rest of the country, other Finnish cities have followed Helsingfors' fate and some border garrisons manned by Finnish and Karelian recruits have mutinied. Copenhagen promised equity and protection to its Finnic subjects, but its despotic rule over the region and the complete indifference for the cries of help coming from across the border have depleted the Finnish patience and trust. Nationalism reaches its natural outcome: a Finnish War of Independence is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191928.A;We will strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.T;The Pacification of the Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.D;With the expulsion of the Slavic invaders, Karelia is united once and for all under the aegis of Scandinavia. Copenhagen has fulfilled its promise to the Finnic nation and now the Landsting can rightfully claim to be the only representative body of all the Nordic peoples. Finnish nationalism will not bother Scandinavia for a long long time, but it will not disappear completely. The hard-earned harmony must be secured from the ambitions of its enemies in the East and in the South, by all means necessary. As our Empire is more united now than it has ever been, we must use this new-found strength to impose our peace on the entire Baltic basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191929.A;A tough chapter ends and a glorious one begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.T;The Great Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.D;After their underwhelming first attempt, the Sampo Society has organized an unprecedented collection of signatures throughout Finland and Karelia with the volunteer help of university students. The meticulous organization of the campaign has resulted in the collection in less than two weeks of over three hundred thousand nominatives, which have been delivered to the Royal Palace in Copenhagen by a delegation of the Society, lead by Count Jakob Stiernhielm and the self-exiled Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise. The recent years of mismanagement of the region have compacted the nationalist front, which has put aside regionalist interferences in favour of pan-Finnic unity, so it might not be possible to hush again separatist sentiments. Were the petition be rejected, the agitators will have their perfect chance to proclaim that Copenhagen does not care for its subjects across the Gulf of Bothnia and this may lead to open rebellion. It seems like we have no choice but to assent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.A;This petition is wasted paper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.B;Maybe this way we can avoid a useless war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.T;The National Diet of Åbo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.D;The Estates of Finland have convened in the main building of the former Royal Academy of Åbo, known as Turku in Finnish, to define once and for all Finland's status within the Scandinavian Realm. The hemicycle is almost perfectly split in half between the self styled "Fennoscandian Party", favourable to the draft articles proposed by the Copenhagen Landsting, and the autonomist deputies, who have adopted the appellation of "Kalevalists", satirically used by a Stockholmer newspaper. The president of the National Diet, Duke Erik Mannerheim, has painstakingly maintained the balance between the two groups, but as the debate advances, Fennoscandians and Kalevalists espouse increasingly divergent and irreconcilable stances. The Finns face the final choice between full citizenship and protection within Scandinavia, as promised by Copenhagen, or the gamble of self-determination. The Nordic Union is hung by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191931.A;We shall wait for the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.T;The National Pledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.D;Thanks to the acclaimed diplomatic skills of Duke Erik Mannerheim, the moderate Kelavalist deputies have found a reasonable agreement with the Fennoscandian Party. The new constitution includes many of the draft articles proposed by Copenhagen and some important additions put forward by the nationalists. The newborn Kingdom of Finland will be a constituent country of the Scandinavian Empire and just like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it will formally retain its national assembly (the Eduskunta) while delegating most of the legislative power to the Empire's Landsting in the capitol. After the solemn National Pledge to the Monarch in the Åbo Cathedral, Count Jakob Stiernhielm delivered a speech asking for the extension of full citizenship rights and protection to the Karelian brethren living across the border, where Slavic expansionism threatens their very existence. By unifying Karelia, Copenhagen may finally prove their good faith and curb Finnish nationalism once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191932.A;Itään!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.D;Despite the best efforts of the deputies loyal to the Empire, a new constitution has been drafted by the Kalevalists with the support of some Fennoscandian defectors. A bold harangue by deputy Charles-Joseph de Frise against the draft articles proposed by the Landsting turned the tide of the National Diet in favour of the nationalists, facilitating the following crucial Kelavalist victories. The new National Assembly (the Eduskunta) and Senate will de facto be completely free from Copenhagen's interference and even if the Scandinavian Monarch will still rule over the newborn Kingdom of Finland, the Governor-General will be merely ceremonial figure. In the mainland, disappointment is widespread among the entire population and the general opinion is that the government has officially abandoned the historical ambition of uniting the Baltic under the Scandinavian banner. As Finland secedes without firing a shot, many are becoming critical of the old and weary Kalmar Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191933.A;Is the end of the Scandinavian Empire drawing nearer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.T;The Diet is dissolved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.D;An attempted arson of the building where the National Diet meets has forced the Prime Minister to halt the assembly indefinitely. In the days preceding the attack, the tense relationship between Fennoscandians and Kalevalists had reached a breaking point, forcing the Diet's president to close the session in multiple occasions due to fights between deputies. A Finnish-language radical newspaper (Aamurusko) claims that the arsonist attack has been orchestrated by the Scandinavian government to impede the rejection of Copenhagen's draft articles in the forthcoming session of the Diet and reinstate the status quo by dissolving the assembly. Despite the lack of evidence, many former Finnic deputies have publicly repudiated the Åbo parliament and have started to organize an autonomous Parliament in Borgå. Unrest is quickly growing in the Finnish countryside and some cities like Tavastehus are already in open rebellion. War seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191934.A;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.T;The Pink Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.D;To contain the escalating violence spreading throughout Finland after the attempted arsonist attack at the National Diet, a large group of former deputies and intellectuals have gathered in Tammersfors to complete as fast as possible the drafting of Finland's constitution. The resulting compromise between the Fennoscandians and moderate Kelavalists has been printed on pink-coloured paper and has started to spread throughout the country, gaining mixed reactions. The proposed arrangement will give Finland a great deal of autonomy, nonetheless substantial control over the Parliament and the Senate will be in the hands of the Governor-General and Copenhagen's Landsting. By recognizing the Pink Declaration, most of the Finnic political and cultural elite will reconcile with Scandinavia, but the anger caused by the Åbo Incident will continue to spread albeit at a weaker pace. War has been avoided at a great cost, but it seems like the ghost of violence will not leave Finland for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191935.A;Troubled times lay ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.T;The Eduskunta in Borgå;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.D;Fostered by the Sampo Society and the nationalist gazette Aamurusko, the leading figures of Finland's political and cultural panorama have gathered in the city of Borgå to draft a constitution for the Kingdom of Finland in complete autonomy from the Landsting and the Crown. As the city celebrates the gathering of deputies from all over the country, a growing number of formerly moderate political figures have openly challenged the dogma of a real union with the Empire of the Scandinavia, petitioning for the creation of a Kingdom of Finland with a king other than that of Copenhagen. All orders to halt this insubordination have gone unheeded and following cascading mutinies most of the Imperial Army warehouses have been looted, limiting Scandinavia's effective rule over the region to some major coastal forts like Sveaborg in the Helsingfors bay. The creation of "National Defence Battalions" demonstrates the intentions of the Finnish deputies: only brute force can end this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191936.A;Finland will know the Mainland's wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.T;The Finnish Declaration of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.D;The birth of Kingdom of Finland has been proclaimed from the balcony of the new Senate building in Helsingfors in front of a packed Central Square. The provisional legislative assembly, the Eduskunta, has nominated a plenipotentiary cabinet, the Senate, which will also have the role of a regency council. Independentist zeal spreads throughout the newborn nation and volunteers flock to the recruitment office for the National Defense Batallions. Copenhagen's control over the region has been reduced to a mere formality and a large influx of Scandinavian-speaking refugees has reached the shores of Sweden, fleeing the incoming persecutions of the nationalist government. The imperial cabinet has tried for the last time to reach a peaceful compromise with the Finnish Senate, but a vote of the Eduskunta against the recognition of the Scandinavian Monarch as the head of state has abruptly ended all negotiations. The Finland Uprising has been set in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191937.A;Österland will pay for this treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.T;The King of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.D;Finland has broken the chains of oppression and now needs a King to rally behind. Most of the Scandinavian-speaking deputies of the Eduskunta support the crowning of Count Jakob Stiernhielm, a descendent of an illegitimate son of King Alexander IV. This conciliatory figure will mend the rift between our Scandinavian and Finnish citizens, but Jakob's conservative nature will most likely letdown and alienate the zealous nationalists that are fueling Finland's morale and war effort. To gain foreign help, many have suggested petitioning Prague for a noble to crown in exchange of mutual support against Scandinavia, but the most popular foreign candidate is the Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise, the self-exiled liberal son of Queen Anne of Burgundy who has become a member of the new Senate. He's the nationalists' choice, but will the Burgundians accept the crowning of this rogue family member and the final conclusion of their long worn off alliance with Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.A;Will Anvers recognize Charles Joseph?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.B;Send a messenger to Prague!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.C;Count Jakob Stiernhielm becomes King Jaakko I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.T;A crown from the gutter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.D;Finland has declared independence from Scandinavia and the provisional Regency Council has decided to ask us for a suitable monarch in exchange of a military alliance and substantial economic concessions. This is the perfect occasion to further weaken Scandinavia's grip of the Baltic Sea. Bedrich z Valdstejna, the most prominent member of one the most influential families of the nation, has proven his political skills as governor of Moravia and his family's close links with Bohemian royalty certainly give him the blue blood necessary to bear the crown. Shall the country prepare for yet another war in the North?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.A;We will stand with the Finns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.B;The proposal is rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.T;A King from Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.D;Frederick von Waldstein has landed in Helsinki in great secret to ensure his safe voyage. After a unanimous approval by the Eduskunta, King Fredrik I has been crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral and has confirmed the special powers delegated to the Senate in the previous days. No one dares to interrupt the celebrations, but many in private whisper that the foreign king is more suitable for palace intrigues than for motivating soldiers before a desperate war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191940.A;We'll just have to make do for this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.T;The unexpected king;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.D;Prague has completely ignored the Senate's request for military support in exchange for political and economical influence over Finland. The secret negotiations have been rapidly covered up, but the Eduskunta awaits a new head of state before Scandinavia recovers from the shock of the secession and strikes down hard over the country. Count Jakob Stiernhielm has refused to accept the crown after he had learned of the attempt to contact the Bohemians, whom he had fought against in the past. The Prince of Friesland has disappeared from Helsinki and many suspect that he would not accept the "Second-Hand" crown, angering his nationalist political base. During the last extraordinary session of the Senate, however, the choice fell on the only political figure in the Eduskunta with unanimous respect and admiration from both the conservatives and the radical nationalists: Duke Erik Mannerheim. Despite his lack of dynastic ties with royal families, the love of his people will ennoble him enough to become a rightful king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191941.A;Long live King Erkki I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.T;The Prince of Friesland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.D;Charles-Joseph de Frise, the second son of Queen Anne, has been proposed as the monarch of the newly independent Kingdom of Finland. Charles Joseph has been a frequent embarrassment for the Burgundian royal family due to his unorthodox political ideas, but his voluntary self-exile to the far North had appeased the court of Anvers. Officially recognizing his investiture will give us substantial political and economical benefits in the new realm, but this alliance with the Finns would force us to leave behind our increasingly problematic political alignment with Copenhagen. Disavowing Charles Joseph comes at no cost beyond the potential risk of a regency should Queen Anne depart with no further heirs, but the potential gains deriving from a change of policy towards Scandinavia are conceivably superior to those coming from renewing our weary alliance with the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.A;Let us help our new Finnish friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.B;He has nothing to do with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.T;The King of all Finns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.D;The Prince of Friesland has been enthusiastically acclaimed as the new monarch by the Eduskunta and the Senate. Charles-Joseph de Frise has decided to relinquish his Burgundian name and title, becoming Kaarle I of Jülich-Kleve-Suomi, King of all Finns. This energetic and charismatic figure enjoys the support of most of the common people and radical nationalists, but many conservative and moderate figures do not hide their fears of his authoritarian tendencies. Time will tell if King Kaarle will respect the directions of his former peers in the Senate and the legislative assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191943.A;God save our glorious King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.T;Citizen and Deputy Charles Joseph;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.D;When informed of the Senate's decision to crown Charles-Joseph de Frise as King of Finland , Anvers replied by disavowing him and condemning the Finnish uprising. While many support the coronation of the "Citizen-King" regardless of Burgundy's hostility, a group of radical nationalists have suggested to remove all traces of the Scandinavian monarchic mentality and name Charles Joseph "President for life of Finland". However, many adversaries of the ambitious Prince of Friesland, including moderates and former loyalists, have voiced their opposition to these eccentric and blatantly autocratic denominations, proposing instead the creation of a republican parliamentary regime, whose head of state will be decided every six years by the national assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.A;Long live King Kaarle I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.B;Finland shall be a free, united and democratic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.C;All hail our perpetual President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.T;The Finnish Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.D;After centuries of Scandinavian domination, Finland has declared its independence and is now fighting to repel its former oppressors. Ever since their conversion to Christianity, Finnish and Karelians have lived under the influence of either Novgorod or Stockholm and later Copenhagen, fighting against each other to conquer every possible inch of the "Eastern Frontier" for their overlords. The publishing in 1835 of the Kalevala, an epic poem based on Finnic oral folklore, triggered the Finnish National Awakening, rallying intellectuals, artists and, later, politicians from both sides of the Scandinavian-Novgorodian border under the common goal of uniting the Finnic people and protecting it from assimilation either from the West or the East. The members of this movement initially hoped to achieve their goals by peacefully petitioning Copenhagen to recognize their rights to citizenship and national unity within the Scandinavian realm, but the indifference and the missteps of the central government caused the radicalization of Finnish nationalism, leading to the current violent secession. Will the Empire of the North live through this new challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191945.A;We shall strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.T;The War in Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.D;With the start of the Finnish Rebellion, Scandinavia has been too busy organizing the reconquest of its former Baltic dominion to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. The Veche is now free to reclaim its former political authority by revoking the illegal privileges of Scandinavian bourgeoisies. The election of the Posadnik will no longer be determined by the whims of Copenhagen. We are finally free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191946.A;Wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.T;The Treaty of Uppsala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.D;A peace treaty between Scandinavia and Finland has been signed in the ancient capitol of the Swedish Kingdom, of which the newborn nation will no longer be part. The unforeseen defeat has been a tremendous blow for the Empire of the North, whose hegemony in the Baltic Sea is now a thing of the past. After centuries of relative internal peace, regional separatist movements have started to reclaim autonomy from weak Copenhagen for the constituent kingdoms of the realm, especially Sweden whose territory has been halved. To survive this dire moment, Scandinavia has to prove once more its might and its importance among the European empires, and when this time comes the East will face our vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191947.A;A minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.T;The Last Northern Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.D;As soon as the fighting reached the outskirts of Helsingfors, the provisional government of Finland realized that the war was lost and that the exhausted National Defense Batallions could not withstand the assault of the Scandinavian army. Most of the members of the Eduskunta have either surrendered to the imperial forces or have fled towards Russia or Germany, where the enemies of the Empire have promised to support the future struggles for independence of the Finnic people. The resurgence of Finnic nationalism will probably be slow to arrive as war has ravaged both the countryside and the urban centres, leaving behind a war torn and disfigured country. Österland will be reorganized in ten military governances and the estates expropriated from the supporters of the revolutionary regime will be gifted to loyal Scandinavian-speaking subjects of the Empire. The effects of the Finnish National Awakening will be reversed with a process of pervasive Scandinavization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN34.T;The Pskov Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN34.D;Bourgeoises, merchants and nobles from both the city and the countryside are reunited every three years in the Pskovian Veche to appoint a new Posadnik, who has always been a Scandinavian Noble since the rebirth of the Republic. Copenhagen enforces its will either through direct interference in the election process or thanks to its fifth column: the Finnish boyars, who are disproportionately numerous in the Veche thanks to Byzantine bureaucracy and special constitutional clauses. An angry mob has killed the newly re-appointed Posadnik, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, by setting fire to the wooden stage where he was delivering his inaugural speech. Some members of the Veche have died and peasants are besieging the City Hall, but an extraordinary session has been summoned nonetheless to nominate a new Posadnik. Copenhagen is too distant to intervene quickly and Finnish boyars are in disarray. For the first time since "independence", Pskov will decide its own ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN35.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN35.D;The Pskovians have rescinded with violent means the privileges of Finnish boyars and in a surprising turn of events the Veche has voted to recognize as sovereign the Prince of Novgorod, rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Uniting the Northern Russians will surely anger Copenhagen, but most of the members of the Novgorodian Veche have already proclaimed their support for this development, regardless of the unavoidable retaliation and the end of Scandinavia's protection against Muscovite expansionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191950.A;Novgorod the Great will return to the Baltic shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.T;Pskov Rejoins Novogrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.D;After the Pskovian peasants killed Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, the Scandinavian-appointed Posadnik of the Republic, a group of Russian boyars took control of the city's Veche and swore fealty to the Prince of Novgorod. Despite the extensive Scandinavian interests in the republic, Pskov is intent on rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Given how the unrest in Finland and the ever-present threat of Bohemia have already stretched our forces thin, it might be wiser to attempt to come to a compromise with the Novgorodians, partitioning the lands of Pskov between each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.A;Offer them the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.B;Never! We will teach these upstarts not to defy Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.T;The Partition of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.D;The Scandinavian reaction to what was effectively a pro-Novgorodian coup has been much milder than anticipated. Copenhagen has offered us a deal in which they agree to recognize our annexation of Pskov as legitimate in exchange for control over Ingria. While a relatively favorable deal, with the bulk of Pskov remaining in our hands, it still fails to resolve the question of our access to the Baltic. There are those in the Veche who loudly proclaim this offer a sign of Scandinavian weakness, and that we should demand the retention of Ingria, even in the event of war. Still others hold that we ought to be satisfied with our laurels, cautioning that Scandinavian protection is the only thing shielding us from aggression by our southern neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.A;Copenhagen shall have Ingria, lest we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.B;We knew the risks. Pskov will be ours, by force of arms if necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.D;The Novgorodians have rejected our generous offer to partition the former Republic of Pskov. Already, Novgorodian armies have begun to mobilize and march towards Finland and our Livonian holdings. For the audacity to reject our treaty the Novgorodians will know the full wrath of Scandinavia as we lay waste to their precious republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191953.A;Spare the rod, spoil the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.T;The Posadnik of the Republic of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.D;The Scandinavian-appointed governor of Pskov, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, has been killed by a riot soon after his re-election. The sudden loss of foreign influence over the Pskovian Veche allowed the Russian boyars to independently choose the city's Posadnik, opting for a compromise figure: Adam Grundel-Helmfelt, the Duke of Narva. Adam is a Stockholm-born entrepreneur and Ingria's richest landowner, who has gained the admiration of Russian boyars with calls for fair representation and administrative reform. After his proclamation as Posadnik, Adam "Nerevsky" (from Narva, a sobriquet on "Nevskij" coined by Finnish colonists) has promulgated a new constitution, abolishing most political privileges of the Finnic minority. De facto this doesn't change much in our protectorate, as almost all the political power is in his hands, but tolerating Pskov's self-rule and pro-Slavic legislation may slowly slip the Republic away from our control. How shall we react? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.A;We shall accept the status quo ... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.B;Perhaps we need to make it clear to this upstart who rules in Pskov?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.D;The whole of Ingria has finally come under direct Scandinavian rule. An autonomous dependency has been set up to administer the territory with the eventual goal of integrating the province directly into the Scandinavian state. After a brief spat with the Novgorodians, mare nostrum Balticum has been reaffirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191955.A;No longer shall Finland and Livonia be threatened from the east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.D;After reaching an agreement with the Scandinavians, Pskov has been allowed to rejoin the Novgorodian Confederation as a constituent republic. While the Scandinavians still hold hostage our access to the Baltic, today is nonetheless a victory for Novgorod the Great. Cries of jubilation can be heard all throughout the republic as our brothers have been reunited with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191956.A;Perhaps one day we may also regain the Baltic coastline ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.T;The expulsion of the Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.D;Scandinavia has extended citizenship rights and protection to all Finnic people, regardless of the country of origin, leading to the overnight annexation of our Karelian territories and the expulsion of our Pomor compatriots who had settled in the region. This blatant violation of the long-standing border treaty with the Empire of the North has caused great outrage in the Novgorodian Veche and most of the city's notables are petitioning for vengeance against foreign invaders and the expulsion of Finnic and Scandinavian nationals from the Republic. Bowing to Copenhagen's will means tainting the secular pride of Novgorodian independence, but denouncing the aggression will remove the political and military protection that lets this pride live on despite threats from the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.A;It's a terrible price to pay if we want to safeguard our Republic's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.B;We shall redraw the western border with our swords and their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.T;The Pskov Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.D;Pan-Russianism has experienced a resurgence in the Republic of Pskov in the wake of the creation of a Russian nation-state. The Russian-majority population of the Republic widely supports the prospect of annexation by Russia but the Finnish boyars who dominate the government enjoy the privileges independence affords them. Recently, however, we have been approached by a group of pro-Russian patriots that promises to seize control of the Veche and proclaim annexation to Russia. They claim that the Pskovian army, composed primarily of Russians, considers Russian annexation favorable -- or at the very least not unfavorable -- and that they would not act to prevent the uprising. Such a move would certainly be more diplomatically palatable than a military invasion of the Republic, though we must still be wary of the Scandinavian response to our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.A;Pskov must join the Russian fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.D;Their work was swift. In the dead of the long Russian night, pan-Russian insurgents had stormed the Veche and seized control over the Republic. The Pskovian army was powerless to stop them, with Russian officers unwilling to fire upon their fellow countrymen and many even rallying to the cause of the rebels. Already, these insurgents have proclaimed the Republic annexed to Russia, and the Russian army has swooped in to take over control from these rebels -- not, however, before the Scandinavian army could seize the fortress at Nyenschanz. The situation remains tense, but one thing remains certain: the Republic of Pskov is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.A;A sad day for the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.T;The Stain on Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more. At one time, the Scandinavians had set up a military administration in its place, but now what was once a Scandinavian governorate has become an independent nation. The basic structure administering the territory has not changed, however, with the predominantly Finnish-Scandinavian ruling class marginalizing the Russian-majority population of the territory. This situation is a stain on the honor of the Russian nation, and nationalists both at home and abroad have called for our government to intervene on the behalf of our oppressed countrymen. Our agents have been covertly organizing the Russian population of Ingria with the promise of Russian support for their revolt, and now the time has come to make good on this pledge. We must wipe this stain off of the maps of Europe and complete the unification of the Russian nation!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.A;We must drive out these Scandinavian freebooters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.T;The Collapse of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.D;Our fledgling administration was always one built on an unstable foundation. Originating as a march of Scandinavia, our nation since its inception has been ruled by force of arms, and not with the consent of the masses. Since our independence from Scandinavia, our ability to provide for our armies has suffered greatly, and with nationalist tensions mounting with the recent unification of Russia it should come as no surprise that our meagre forces have been quickly overrun by a country-wide nationalist revolt. The whole of Ingermanland has been seized by these rebels and transferred to Russian control, barring the fortress at Nyenschanz, which has been hastily occupied by our evacuating forces. What still exists of our army has defected back to our former Scandinavian overlords, ensuring that in both fact and name Ingermanland no longer exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.A;It was only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.T;The Problem of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying us access to the Baltic. Chafing under Scandinavian suzerainty, and inspired by our recent national unification, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of our new nation. While the revolt was ultimately put down via Scandinavian intervention, the magnitude of the revolt has turned the opinions of the great powers of Europe largely against Scandinavian rule. With Russia now united under our rule, and Scandinavia diplomatically isolated on this issue, we have seen fit to press the claims of these nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.A;Pskov will be liberated from the Scandinavian tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.T;The Treaty of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying the Russians access to the Baltic. Chafing under our suzerainty, and inspired by the recent unification of the Russian princes, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of the newly-formed Russian nation. While we succeeded in restoring power to the surviving members of the Veche, the Russians have decided to press the claims of these rebels, and after witnessing the scope of the uprising the rest of the great powers of Europe generally agree that we should make some concessions to the Russians living in the territory./n /n Having succeeded in isolating us, our only diplomatic recourse now is to reach a settlement favorable to the Russians that at least ensures our security in Finland and Livonia. Should the Russians reject our offer there can be no doubt that they will take this opportunity to seize Pskov for themselves. There are some who believe that war may be a good thing, however. If we were to triumph over the Russians on the field of battle, they would be forced to recognize our control over Pskov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.A;The Russians may have Pskov, but we will retain Nyenschanz as a matter of national security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.B;Never! The Gate of Russia is ours alone to open and close at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.T;An Offer from Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.D;Having been forced to the negotiating table, Copenhagen has approached us with a highly favorable treaty in which the majority of Pskov will be immediately annexed to us. Scandinavia will maintain control only over their fortress at Nyenschanz and only for a period of 15 years as they prepare adequate defenses elsewhere in Finland, after which point they promise to hand the territory over to us. Of course, the Scandinavians may always renege on that promise, but perhaps that is a risk worth taking. If our interests in the north are not that great, a friendly neighbor in Scandinavia will certainly prove a valuable asset as we direct our attention in other directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.A;This is everything we could have hoped for! We will accept their treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.B;We cannot tolerate Scandinavian control over the mouth of the Neva for even one more minute! Nyenschanz shall be ours immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.D;Once again the great powers of Europe have convened to decide the fate of an independent nation and once again that nation was not party to their negotiations. While the Scandinavians supported us in putting down that nationalist revolt they have now backstabbed us at the negotiation table. Russia and Scandinavia have mutually agreed to partition our nation, with the Republic of Pskov henceforth being no more in the eyes of the world. The Pskovian Veche has with great sorrow assembled for one last time to pass a measure confirming the dissolution of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.A;Perhaps someday an international organization may exist to protest these infringements on national sovereignty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.D;The Scandinavians thought that they could placate us with empty promises and half-hearted efforts at reconciliation. But no! We reject any offer from Copenhagen short of the complete unification of the Russian nation, and to that end we have declared a state of war with Scandinavia. Pskov has declared itself an indivisible part of the Russian nation and we intend on making good on that fact. Scandinavia shall not deny us our heritage, and they shall not throttle our access to the Baltic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.A;We shall teach them the might of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.T;Humiliation from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.D;Our forces have been soundly defeated by the armies of Russia! As part of the peace agreement, we have been forced to recognize as valid the declaration from those upstart nationalists. The whole of Pskov shall be immediately annexed to Russia without partition. In return, the Russians have withdrawn their occupation forces from Finland and Livonia, restoring our control over the regions. With the loss of Ingria, our holdings in Finland and Livonia are no longer connected by land, and the loss of the fortress at Nyenschanz has left both Finland and Livonia undefended from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.A;Well, at least we still have Finland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.D;The peasant hordes of Russia proved to be no match for the professional armies of Scandinavia! The Russian bear lies before us, defeated and discredited, leaving us free to act as we please with respect to Ingria. Having recognized how the nominally independent Republic of Pskov failed to defend our interests against the mounting nationalist pressures of the population, we have seen fit to dissolve the republic and replace it with a military commission to govern the region directly under the control of Copenhagen. The Ingermanland March, as it is known, will pave the way for Scandinavian and Finnish settlement in the region, ensuring the future loyalty of the territory and the smooth transition to eventual Scandinavian integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.A;Pskov has served its purpose. Now Copenhagen has taken control of the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more, and in its place we have set up a military administration over its former territories. The measures that the Ingermanland March has taken to ensure the loyalty of the territories have been admittedly harsh, with the forcible relocation of large parts of the Russian population being commonplace, amongst other practices. Recent publications of accounts of our rule, while clearly heavily embellished, have nonetheless caused outrage throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, creating a crisis over the region. How this ultimately plays out remains to be seen, but for now we have taken direct control over the affected regions from the Ingermanland March as a temporary measure in order to quell the immediate concerns over our march’s governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.A;Oops ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.D;Accounts of Scandinavian atrocities in Ingria have circulated for a while now, but for the first time we now have definitive proof of their conduct in the territory. Papers containing orders to seize the lands of Russian landowners, and forged documents detailing the transfer of property from said landowners to Scandinavian and Finnish settlers have been intercepted. Mass graves of Russian peasants have been uncovered and photographed, as have the deserted villages from which they originated. Newspapers all across Europe are now publishing accounts of these atrocities, inflaming public opinion against the Scandinavian occupation. At this point, we could either send an ultimatum to the Scandinavians, demanding reparations for their violence and the transfer of those lands inhabited by a Russian majority, or we could forgo asking entirely and simply seize the entirety of the Ingermanland March. Either way, our cause is just, and the great powers of Europe are unlikely to intervene against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.A;These barbarians are not fit to govern Russians! Demand the land and reparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.B;We must seize the whole of Ingria and punish them for these deplorable acts of violence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.T;The Russian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.D;The Russians have sent us an ultimatum. In it, they demand that we cede to them those territories in Ingria inhabited by a Russian-majority population. They have also demanded financial reparations on behalf of the victims, both real and imagined, of our rule over the region. Do we give in to their demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.A;The Russians have isolated us. We have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.B;A hundred thousand men will lie dead before we cede an inch of soil to the Russians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.T;A Baltic Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.D;While we do not necessarily lack a Baltic coastline, that short stretch we do control is unsuitable for the construction of any sort of harbor. As a result, most of our northern trade continues to flow to the rest of Europe via the Neva, allowing the Scandinavians to maintain a stranglehold on our trade with their control of Nyenschanz. With the rise of a unified Russian economy and the growing economic prosperity it has brought us, the situation has reached a point where it has become necessary to gain free access to the markets of Europe, whether that be by direct control over the Neva estuary or some other agreement with the Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.A;Perhaps the Scandinavians can accommodate us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.T;The Conference of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.D;While the Conference of Helsinki quickly concluded that the Scandinavian straits should be free and open to international traffic, the original issue that prompted negotiations in the first place -- that of Scandinavian Ingria -- remained unresolved. The proposal that seemed to have the most traction was to partition the Ingermanland March, with Scandinavia retaining the fortress at Nyenschanz in order to defend Finland while Russia gains a length of coastline suitable for the construction of a new port. Russia would also be exempt from paying the large indemnity we receive for abolishing the toll. Another proposal, albeit less popular, was to cede the entirety of Ingria to the Russians in exchange for their recognition of our sovereignty over Karelia. Still others are frustrated with these negotiations in the first place, having become upset that the issue has resulted in the loss of the Sound Toll, and maintain that we ought at least retain the whole of Ingria for having lost this major source of state revenue. (ONLY REJECTION IS POSSIBLE IN CURRENT BUILD);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.A;We have already lost our right to the Sound Toll. Ingria is where we draw the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.D;Negotiations have broken down between us and the Scandinavians. They insist on maintaining their stranglehold on our access to the Baltic, which to us is unacceptable. We will make Scandinavia pay for their crimes against the Russian nation as we seize the whole of Ingria from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.A;They shall soon know to fear the Russian bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.T;The Loss of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.D;Vae Victis! Woe to the defeated! With our forces crushed by the armies of Russia, we are forced to recognize the Russian annexation of Ingria and the loss of our claims to the territory. In return, the Russians have agreed to withdraw from Finland and Livonia, though who knows how long until the Russians come back to seize those as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.A;We have been humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.T;The Humiliation of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.D;Victory! Our armies stand victorious over the battered Russian bear! As part of the treaty creating peace between our two nations, the Russians have been forced to pay a large indemnity for damages caused by their armies to the property of Scandinavian citizens. The Russians have also been forced to recognize our control over Ingria “in perpetuity.” How long “perpetuity” is in actuality remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the humiliation Russia has experienced at our hands will forbid them from Ingria for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.A;The Russian bear has been declawed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI2.T;The Imperial Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI2.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Joseph. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, the emperor and his family ended in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Joseph crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI3.T;The Imperial coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI3.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Ferdinando. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, Ferdinando made a great speech at the ruins of the Coliseum about his late father who paved the way for the success of the crown of Aragon. The emperor and his family ended their tour of the city in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Ferdinando crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI4.T;Troubles in the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.D;None thought that proclaiming the Empire would solve all problems in the Western Mediterranean but the young empire faces several oppositions that could spell the end of the Serna dream. First the Pope, angered by the Imperial coronation and the reduction of his temporal powers, is proving to be hard to manage, especially as the devout hordes of catholics in the South and the rest of the Empire look up to him. The northern princes of Italy have not stayed idle either, with Marianists gathering support against what they consider our illegitimate rule. And Catalonia, once the center of the Crown, has seen various liberal and nationalist agitators advocating for an independent and republican Catalonia. We must be careful not to upset these groups if we don't want to see the end of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.A;We will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC1.T;The Rzeczpospolita;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLC1.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC2.T;The death of Maximilian III;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.D;The king of the Commonwealth has died in Warsaw after 20 years of rule mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his Kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maximilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto (the right for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly) and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. Despite his political weakness he leaves a good memory to the citizens of Warsaw that have gathered in huge crowds for his funeral. Now the prepatory Sejm will convene to select candidates to his succession, with his son Stanislaw in good place to succeed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.A;Farewell Maksymilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.T;The Sejm in deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.D;The Sejm has been convened for already several months and has not been able to advance a definitive list of candidates to the succession of Maximilian III. The main problem resides in the candidacy of his son Stanislaw, a well-known Liberal and independent noble which is seen as a threat by both the foreign powers of Scandinavia and Bohemia but also by the most powerful nobles of the country who fear he will try to rescind their privileges. The liberation of his serfs in his own domain in 1833 was already widely criticized by the Magnateria while giving Stanislaw widespread popularity outside of the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.A;Will they be able to elect someone already ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.T;The Black procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.D;Following the deadlock of the prepatory Sejm, several prominent members of the Polish bourgeoisie (including delegates from Kiev, Danzig or Vilnius) gathered in the streets of the capital to hasten the process and demanding more rights for the people no belonging to the nobility. The burghers had been protesting the difference of treatment for years but it was the first time such an event was organized. While the mayor of Warsaw, Michael Konopka, was officially the main organizer of the march, it is widely understood that this was coordinated by Stanislaw Habsburg to strengthen his partisans in the Sejm. While completely pacific, going against Stanislaw could prove to provoke troubles with the Liberal movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC5.T;Choosing the candidates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC5.D;Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts and of the principality of Smolensk the Sejm continued to be deadlocked. Eventually the Sejm would have to choose the candidates for the election. After weeks of debates 4 candidates demarked themselves : Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobility. Johannes von Wettin cousin of the duke of Prussia supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw Habsburg is put into the list or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC8.D;Democratic liberals in $COUNTRY$ have been ignored for a long time, the nobles ruling the country being content with allowing expression of discontent but doing nothing about it. The government of Warsaw has discovered a liberal plot to kill the current King and replace him with the shunned candidate Stanislaw Habsburg who would promulgate several reforms and abolish the Golden liberties. This plot was denounced by one of his members and the Army has raided the houses of the main leaders while an attempt of seditious members of the people to rise against us was squashed in blood. Most of the leaders were convicted of treason and executed while Stanislaw, who was apparently not aware of the conspiracy, has fled the country to avoid such a fate. The Rzeczpospolita endures, and the dominance of the Nobles as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC9.D;Following his election, Stanislaw I tried several times to assemble a confederated Sejm, a type of assembly where the liberum veto could not be used as to pass several laws and appease the liberals of the various towns. Despite all his efforts, the opposition of the nobility led to no consensus and he was forced to call a regular Sejm that was blocked by several noblemen who used their golden liberties to stop all attempts at reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC10.T;The Warsaw riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC10.D;Following the results of the Sejm, the liberals and people of Warsaw assaulted several noblemen notoriously known for their opposition to reforms in the capital. Order was only restored after the intervention of the Royal guards, with the King himself protecting his opponent Jozef Potocki who found shelter in the Royal Palace after nearly being killed by the crowd. This event has reinforced the will of the reformers who are now persuaded that only them stand between chaos and the preservation of order while magnates are scared and hire more members for their guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Crowds rejoice in the country as a brighter future appears for the Polish masses but in the same time the nobility and foreign powers intend to crush this democratic revolution. Meanwhile Stanislaw Habsburg has gained an impressive popularity and the old elective monarchy has been abolished, with his sons to succeed him as constitutional monarchs in the decades to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Now the Jagiellons of Prague have annexed western Poland while putting a cadet of their family on the throne of 'Poland', the first in 300 years. Little Poland has been reorganized as the duchy of Galicia with its capital in Krakow, while the Baltic coast has also been taken from Poland with Lithuania now a Scandinavian puppet.

BOH1.T;The Inauguration of the Wenceslaus V Plaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.D;Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V reigned during the years of the German Revolution and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning intellect, he was able to quell the revolts of the German liberals within the Holy Roman Empire and fought coalitions of various powers who were keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe. But he was too successful for his own good, and "the Lion of the North", as he was called after his successes at slaying Scandinavian battalions, was eventually forced to sue for peace. Wenceslaus would be murdered the following year and would be succeeded by his son, Sigismund V. Sigismund V today opened a plaza in Prague which openly embraced his reactionary father in a pompous ceremony and promised that his father's successes will be emulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.A;The people celebrate an Empire of a thousand years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.T;Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.D;Sigismund V came to power in a tender age of 10 after his father was unceremoniously assassinated. German liberals deny their involvement in this affair, and there are indeed rumours that it was done by the hands of the Bohemian aristocracy, but it was always clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of the German liberals. Despite his unfortunate early upbringing, he has shown to inherit many of his father’s desires for statecraft, and his desire to unite the HRE under a Bohemian leadership. His staunch reactionary political motivations make him unpopular beyond the Bohemian borders, but his promises for a return to glory make him popular among our aristocrats. Time will tell if his dreams would come to pass under his reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH3.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.D;Risen from ruins, the German liberal cause did not die after the failed revolution at the end of the last century. Indeed, it continued today as several students, scholars and judges remembered the large banquet on the Zeil, a renowned street in the city centre of Frankfurt thirty years ago. After some festivities, the petty noble and Grand Judge of the city of Dortmund had proclaimed in a moment of silence that resistance to the Bohemian yoke and the tyranny of the aristocracy shall not end, that those who fight for the cause will not separate and reassemble wherever it is required, until a Constitution for the HRE is established. Needless to say, the potentates of Germany and beyond are shocked that these acts of treason are still celebrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH4.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.D;The Court in Anvers was informed today that several renowned German liberals were holding a banquet in remembrance to the Zeil Oath, indeed an act of treason of the German liberals against the established order, in Frankfurt. While the upper echelons of the Burgundian society reacted in shock, most Germans within our borders either reacted with mild amusement or ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the heart of the German nation.

BOH7.T;Creation of the Wolfgang Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.D;The elder branch of the House of Jagiellon, to which the kings of Bohemia belong, deeply distrust the intentions of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karlstein, which would succeed to the throne of Bohemia should the senior branch die out. Sigismund Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein is the head of this cadet branch which grew infamous during the Great German War for having championed the liberal cause. This eventually led to the assassination of the father of Wolfgang, who dropped his first two names which were associated with the elder branch. Today, Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein announced in Dresden the creation of the Wolfgang Society which occupies itself with reformist tendencies, which seem to have gained ground among our population. Further observation of the situation is the only thing we can do for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.A;Reforms? In Bohemia? With Sigismund V?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.D;In the years after the Great German War, the Grand Duchy of Franconia, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold, had transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany. Duke Leopold IV and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are part for the reason for the announcement of former author and today's chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Franconian throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.A;The Duke will be remembered fondly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.D;In a lunatic statement of the Franconian chancellory, liberal reforms have swept through the Grand Duchy of Franconia which already housed a number of exiled German poets and other apologists. While this is a clear affront to the Bohemian authority over Germany and can only be resolved through a brutal 'restoration of the status quo', the liberal factions of our court proposed the acceptance of this Franconian Charter of Rights to prevent bloodshed. This, however, would threaten our position as a reactionary stronghold of Germany and open the gates for vile Burgundian and Scandinavian influence. Sigismund V's cabinet has decided that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.A;"... we must defend the Empire from this Charter!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.B;"... war shall be no more.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.T;Sigismund V's intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.D;In a tragic twist of unfortunate events, Sigismund V was convinced by the scheming part of  his cabinet of ministers that he should overrule the decision met by the cabinet and to declare war on Franconia to remove the Franconian Charter of Rights and to remove the liberal Grand Duke Leopold IV. While this made the king unpopular among the higher levels of the Bohemian government, it was welcomed by fellow reactionary governments in Central Europe who fear that the Charter might find followers elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.A;Sigismund V shall guide us to our triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.T;The $YEAR$ Fire of Nuremberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.D;During the Bohemian Invasion of Nuremberg, a siege conducted by Bohemian soldiers led to a hellfire setting the city ablaze. Hundreds were killed, and Duke Leopold IV of Franconia was forced to flee his palace and found refuge in Londres. Wildly condemned to be willfully perpetrated by ill-willed Bohemian corporals, Sigismund V denied any involvement. The Burning of Nuremberg ended the reign of the liberal Leopold IV and the installation of his younger, more reactionary brother Hermann III as a Bohemian puppet. The anger over the fire will inevitably change the geopolitics of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.A;Let the city light our way to order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH12.T;The Närmberchlied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH12.D;The Närmberchlied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit" (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, the Danubians have begun to use these three words as a slogan against the Bohemian authority and to end their arbitrary rule over the lands of the Danube.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH14.T;The Nürnberglied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH14.D;The Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was a thinly veiled insult and exclusion of the Bohemian people to the German cultural group and was not long after its first publication in Leipzig banned in the Kingdom of Bohemia. And yet, this ban only made this forbidden song, in the wake of recent events in Franconia, more popular among our youth and beyond our borders as more and more liberal secret societies are forming around a single, unifying line of the Nürnberglied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH14.A;"Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.T;The Defenestration of Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.D;What started as a crackdown of a liberal association of students in Dresden quickly escalated into a nationwide series of revolts against the absolute and arbitrary rule of Sigismund V which has now strained one nerve too many: the Royal Guard, fed up with the destructive rule of Sigismund V, stormed the royal palace of Prague and forced his abdication in favour of Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein. And yet, Sigismund, as ambitious as one knows him, tried to flee in the same night and was caught by a corporal in a narrow street of the Wenceslaus V Plaza. Fueled by blind anger, the citizens forced Sigismund V to climb up the The Church of Our Lady of the Snows and was promptly defenestrated from the top of the bell tower, killing the former Emperor instantaneously on impact with the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.A;Long live King Ludwig Wolfgang I of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH16.T;The End of the Thousand Years' Reich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH16.D;The HRE nominally continued to exist even after the Great German War despite the apparent division of the empire among Scandinavian, Burgundian and Bohemian spheres of interest. Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, with the ascension of liberal Ludwig Wolfgang I to the crown of Bohemia, who ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. And thus, he officially abdicated the position of (nominal) Holy Roman Emperor, with no successor to follow in his place. The Holy Roman Empire no longer exists, and yet Bohemia and all of Germany marches onwards, as the rays of dawn cover a new horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, when Sigismund V, now pressured by liberal faction within his court who were able to outmaneuver reactionary aristocrats after the Great Fire of Nuremberg, today declared his abdication of the Holy Roman Crown, with no successor to follow in his place. Instead, as an attempt to stabilize the Kingdom of Bohemia, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Bohemia, ruling from $YEAR$ onwards as Emperor Sigismund I of Bohemia. This marks the end of the Thousand Years' Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH17.A;"Altes Werk im neuen Gewand.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH18.T;The Trial of the 37;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH18.D;In the light of the coronation of Ludwig Wolfgang I, he ordered the arrest of the 37 citizens of Prague responsible for the Defenestration of previous king Sigismund V. These men, now simply dubbed "The 37 of Prague" were ordered to be executed for the extra-judicial maiming of the former head of the Jagiellon Dynasty. This move, although expected and understood to be out of fear that this regicide might become a source of inspiration for even more radical factions of Europe, was only announced after the 37 of Prague were judged by the High Court of Bohemia and executed through hanging on the outskirts of the capital. The feared reaction did not manifest itself, however. No tear was shed by the peasantry over these faceless agitators, and there were no celebrations held over their death in the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TAR2.T;Peace in the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.D;The past few years have seen the Western Pontic steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the scale of violence and destruction seen during the XVIIth and XVIIIth century in the Wild Fields between Ukraine, Russia and Tatarstan. While in the West the Zaporizhian and Dnieper hosts watch the unstable Polish-Lithuanian south-eastern borders, the Don Cossacks have recognized the Prince of Ryazan as their liege. Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids still happen it will need a change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts on the warpath. Should we unite into a single host, we might become one of the great powers of the East, and teach freedom to the oppressive magnates from the Commonwealth and the boyars from Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.A;We will see how long it lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While border raids with the Tatars still happen it will need a drastic change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts back on the warpath : should one of the hosts be annexed, or their neighbours become too powerful they will surely unite into a single host and become a formidable force in their own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR6.D;The Wild Fields, this area from the Pontic Steppe fought between bands of Slavic warriors and mercenaries who call themselves the Cossacks and the Tatar khanates has seen much bloodshed in the past centuries. The Cossacks hosts fought the Tatars, Russian and Polish ambitions, and amongst themselves while attracting serfs and slaves from their neighbors lured by the freedom of the Cossack lifestyle. The Wild fields had enjoyed an era of relative peace in the past few years but this status quo has been broken as the Cossack hosts now gather their men to face a new situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.A;What will happen to these lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a renowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War, and now, with the influence of Constantinople shinking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has begun to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

203511.A;A new era for Crimea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.T;Standardization of the Tatar Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.D;Of the many reforms implemented by Murad II, the codification of the Tatar language is often seen as his most important legacy. Prior to the standardization of the Tatar language, various different dialects of the Tatar language were spoken throughout the Wild Fields, all with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Literacy remained low amongst the Tatar peoples, in part due to their migratory nature but also largely due to the difficulty of learning the Arabic script the language was traditionally written in. Under the direction of Murad II, a new script based on the Roman one was developed for the Tatar language, and spellings and grammatical conventions were codified largely from the Crimean dialect. This allowed for the written language to be significantly easier to learn for both foreigners and native speakers, and opened up Crimea to an influx of Western ideas and literature. While the new standard was not initially popular outside the lands of the Crimean Khanate, with time these conventions would come to be adopted as the Standard Tatar language, especially as a Tatar national awakening began to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203512.A;How do you read this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.T;Military Reforms of Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.D;Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the early successes of the Crimean state were Murad II’s reforms of the army of the Crimean Khanate. Having studied Western military tactics and doctrine of the last century, and having witnessed their effectiveness during the Ottoman Civil War, Murad II had become convinced of the need for military reform. While the previous hybridization of Turkish and Cossack military doctrines had fared well against the irregular forces normally encountered in the steppes by Tatar regiments, such tactics fared poorly in an open engagement between regular military forces. Thus, under Murad II, the lance was discarded in favor of the smoothbore, and a highly disciplined army unfettered by the cossack soldier’s intimidation or provocation was formed. While initially unpopular, Murad II’s military reforms ensured the long-term survival of the Crimean state in the face of encroaching Cossack and Russian expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203513.A;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.T;The Unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.D;Both the Russian principalities and the Cossack hosts have been hungrily eyeing Tatar lands for decades now, and both have been growing in power in recent years. For the Tatars to remain free from foreign subjugation, they must be united into a single nation powerful enough to resist foreign incursions. As the only Tatar polity to even resemble a modern state, the mantle falls upon us to unite our brethren under our benevolent rule and to drive the Russians and Cossacks out of Tatarstan. Our first step lies in the conquest of our neighbors to the north, the Astrakhan Khanate. While none of the Tatar khanates remain unscathed from the times of the Departure, the Astrakhan Khanate was the one most devastated by the conquests of the Cossack hordes. Despite decades having passed, the Astrakhan Khanate has yet to recover, only staving off foreign conquest due to the relative worthlessness of their lands to the Russians and the constantly shifting political situation amongst the principalities. Before the political tides change in Russia, we must conquer them and utilize what resources they do have to strengthen our own position in the Wild Lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.A;The Astrakhan Khanate is weak. We must seize the advantage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.B;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.T;Conquest of Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.D;The Khanate of Kazan has been in slow decline for decades, and has only recently begun to recover from the Chayka Rebellion. With the Khan of Kazan increasingly relying on foreign support to maintain his rule, Kazan teeters on the edge of becoming little more than a Ryazanian client state. Before the Ryazanians can make their move, we must invade the Khanate of Kazan, and with our armies now experienced in the use of new tactics and weaponry after our conquest of Astrakhan we will no doubt make quick work of any forces Kazan may throw at us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.A;Surely our armies will not stop with just Astrakhan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.B;Perhaps it would be wise not to be too ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.T;Djihad for Saraj the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.D;Saraj the Great. Located in the approximate geographical center of Tatar culture, this city represents much to the myriad peoples of the Steppes. Prior to its conquest by the Akhtuba Host, the city was the main source of wealth and power for the Astrakhan Khanate, controlling portage between the Don and Volga Rivers, and was even briefly the capital of the khanate after the Dzungar sack of Astrakhan. With the loss of the city to the peasant armies of Zarubin Chayka, the Astrakhan Khanate was left in shambles, and the whole Tatar nation was shaken by the loss of that magnificent city to the Cossack heathens. With our recent unification of the Tatar nation, prominent imams all across Tatar lands have called for a Djihad for the reconquest of Saraj the Great. We now stand at a crossroad; on one hand, such a move would surely unite the diverse peoples of our newfound Tatar state under a single banner, and would obtain for us a worthy city for the capital of our new nation. On the other hand, the fall of the Akhtuba Host would certainly rouse the other formerly neutral Cossack hosts into action against us, potentially creating an enemy we are not prepared to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.A;Onwards to Saraj the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.B;We must not provoke the Hosts into uniting against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.T;The Fall of the Akhtuba Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.D;Truly, Allah is on our side! The heathens of the Akhtuba Host have fallen before our invincible armies, and much of the remaining Cossack interlopers have been driven out or killed. Saraj the Great now lies in our hands, never again to fall to the infidel. So claim the devout amongst us, anyway. Already, however, Cossack riders have been spotted broaching our borders, and cross-border raids from the remaining hosts have nearly ceased altogether. The more cautious warn that this is the calm before the storm, and that cossack forces are preparing for a massive war the likes of which has not been seen since the end of the cossack Departure. Whatever the case may be, should the remaining cossack hosts decide to mobilize against us, they will not find us unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.A;Let their armies break before us like waves crashing on a rocky shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.T;The People of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.D;While nominally a nation united by Islam and opposition to Russian expansion, there exist great disparities between the various different peoples that constitute the Tatar nation. The Tatars of Crimea have long been within the Ottoman cultural sphere, while the Tatars of Kazan have grown to share certain commonalities with their Russian neighbors to the north. In addition to this, recent overtures in Crimea to opening up to the West have led to an influx of ideas regarding secularization and the rights of man throughout the lands of the former khanate, meanwhile large parts of the Tatar population outside of Crimea have grown to resent this trend of increasing liberalism in Crimea. These two factions will almost certainly create much friction as the new Tatar nation struggles to define what it exactly means to be a “Tatar.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.A;To be a Tatar is to live free from foreign yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.T;Troubles brewing in Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.D;Unlike its northern neighbours, the Princedom of Ryazan holds little esteem for the title of Prince and has embraced the tradition of elective monarchy of its most powerful neighbour, albeit sugar-coating it with token remembrances of ancient Slavic customs. The Ryazanian Duma has always picked a Repnin since the union of the princess Anastasia with Nicholas Repnin, but the possibility of declaring loyalty to a charismatic unifier, like during the time of the Troubles, remains a very possible outcome. The real power in Ryazan thus lies not in the hands of the Prince but in the hands of the nobility leaders assembled in the Duma. Currently, Michael II Repnin rules in Ryazan and his fondness of military affairs (that gave him the nickname of 'Prince-in-the-barracks') has led many boyars to believe that he is not very interested in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.A;It will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.T;The coup of Michael II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.D;Despite appearances, Michael II, the so-called 'Prince-in-the-barracks' had been creating an ever-growing network of collaborators, especially among the Cossacks from the Don Host. His contempt for serfdom and boyar excesses has become more and more evident over the past few months and he finally decided to make his opinion known by assembling the Duma in his palace of Ryazan. Cossacks then surrounded the chamber where Michael II had called the nobles, while he attempted to proclaim the dissolution of the assembly and his reign as autocrat of Ryazan. The boyars were taken by surprise at first, but soon fighting erupted as the nobles launched their own retinues against the Cossack guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.A;The Coup is successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.B;Boyars take control of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.D;Michael II had succeeded in his coup. He is now autocrat of Ryazan with all power over the state, a feat that no Prince of Ryazan has managed since the times of Alexander II Repnin 'the Gunpowder Prince.' The Boyars' have been crushed, many lying dead and the few remaining either rallied to him or are in shackles. One of the first actions he took was the release of the Don Host from their allegiance. Cossacks had helped him access true power, and he thus had to pay his debt to them. However the alliance between the ataman Beketov and the prince endured, and Michael II still retained many Cossack advisors in his court and own army. Among them was the notorious commander of the guard, soon promoted to general of the Prince's armies, Yemelyan Razin, who was soon to be recognized as one of the finest commanders of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.A;Until another day, Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.T;Victory of the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.D;The fight begun by Michael II ended poorly for the Prince. As the Boyars fought for their lives, the Prince himself was killed in the fray of battle, with his Cossack guards either meeting the same fate or surrendering. The Boyars soon crowned the nephew of Michael II, Pyotr Repnin as his successor. A weak boy aged 13, he would be no danger to the power of the Duma. The various nobles now had to take a stance towards the Don Host. The ataman Pyotr Beketov has already announced that he was loyal to the Prince and did not recognize the new prince, hosting the son of Michael II, Alexander, in their territory as the legitimate heir. We could let these peasants go as they have been a thorn in our side for decades or move to directly annex them, although that may stir the other Cossacks against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.A;Let the Host go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.B;We will take back our lands from this 'host'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.T;The Cossack threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.D;As we feared the Cossacks have united following our takeover of the Don host. While it may seem unimportant, these Cossacks claim the lands we have taken and thus could strike against us when the fight with the other principalities begin. It is thus of the utmost importance that we strike first and place various loyal atamans to rule the steppe in our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR25.A;Down with the Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.T;Victory over the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.D;The feared Cossack bands were no matched for the armies of Ryazan who crushed their resistance and forced them to come to terms. The general Rada would be abolished, with the various hosts created again with loyal atamans placed at their helm. Now the South waits for Ryazan and soon Russian orders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.A;A mighty victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.T;Defeat in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.D;Our ambitions were too grandoise, and our armies could not defeat the bands of hastily prepared peasants of the South. We have lost our opportunity to create a strong state in the South and may never gain such an opportunity again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.A;A sad day for Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.T;Renew the Departure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.D;The Akhtuba host was founded as the last free Cossack host, on the ruins of the Chayka rebellion and the Turgut attack on the Astrakhani. We have spent decades defeating the various Tatar rebellions and raiders in our territory but it is not enough. As the princes of the North and even the Tatars themselves change, we must also renew our conquests of the Wild Lands and end the Astrakhani khanate once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.A;Let us end the Mohamedan !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.B;We can’t do that…;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.T;The Ukrainian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.D;Ukraine has been formed in the West by the various Cossack hosts as a means of protecting our way of life from invaders. We were not included in the original deal because of our power and also fierce independence, but as years go on and we see the stability brought by this new state, it seems to many that it would be in our interest to join our brothers under one Host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.A;Ukraine is the path forward !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.B;Our independence can’t be negotiated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR30.T;The Akhtuba Cossacks join us !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.D;The Akhtuba host that didn’t join our state after the general Rada has approached us seeking to join our glorious federation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.A;Long live Ukraine !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR31.T; Stepan Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.D;As the Cossack hosts finally threw out the Polish officials and declared independence, the Dnieper host elected Stepan Sternenko as their new Hetman. A renowned mercenary who was forbidden by Warsaw to come back to his homeland because of his experience in the German Wars and also the Hungarian Independence War, he is widely seen as one of the Cossack national heroes. But his friends and allies know that his ambitions are wild and he sees himself as the successor of the Blue Hetman, Semen Bilozersky that had unified the people of Ukraine against the Commonwealth. And he is ready to destroy anyone who might try to hinder his work.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.A;Who does he think he is ?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.T;Sternenko’s move;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.D;As the Rada convened in Kharkov, Hetman Sternenko began his speech by referring to the Blue Hetman uprising of the XVIIth century. Since his defeat, Cossacks in Western Ukraine had lived under the Polish boot and the various hosts were used as pawns for foreign designs. With their new independence, the Dnieper Cossacks were designated by God to unify the Wild Lands, by force if need be, and for this to happen, Sternenko demanded full war-powers and the end of the Rada convenings until unification. As the votes are cast …;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.A;Sternenko secures power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR32.B;Sternenko loses power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR33.T;Reunification of the Western Host;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.D;The Western Cossacks had been united in a single host before the Polish forcefully separated the lands between the Dnieper and Zaporizhian hosts. Now is the time to end the pesky southern host and unify Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.A;For Cossack unity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.T;Securing the Donets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR34.D;The Donets basin was settled by independent Cossacks in the Departure Era, and has many times been threatened by the heathen Crimean sultanate. We have the duty to protect them from the Muslims and secure these vital black lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.A;For Cossack victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.T;Ending the Northern lapdogs;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.D;The Don Cossacks pledged themselves to the Princedom of Ryazan long ago and their new independence still is plagued by the influence of their boyars. We must strike against them to secure a strong and pure Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.A;For Cossack purity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.T;Failure of Sternenko;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.D;The ambitions of the Hetman were ended as he suffered defeat in his unification wars. His opponents profited from this to convene a new Rada and end his Hetmanate, leaving him to flee for his life abroad. Now the Ukrainian plains return to peace and their old ways of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.A;Defeat means peace at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR37.T;Sternenko’s ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.D;At last, Ukraine has been united under the protection of Sternenko and his valorous soldiers. But now is the time for ruling. Already over the course of his campaigns, Sternenko made several laws modernizing the Host and turning into a real state like the rest of the West. Lingering Cossack influences have already hindered his efforts, but it seems that Ukraine’s future as a united polity is secure. But many wonder what this state will be : Sternenko has harboured some ambitions for his office to become hereditary and thus make Ukraine a monarchy, but he has fought along many Republicans in his life and could give powers to a renewed Chorna Rada.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.A;A Cossack Republic is what we need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.B;The Hetman shall lead as our monarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.C;Nothing really needs to change;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR38.T;The Kazan threat;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.D;After taking back power from the hands of the Duma, Michael II set his eyes on his neighbor : the Khanate of Kazan. The Khanate has been declining for decades, and held only because of the help we provided in putting down the Chayka rebellion that saw slaves rebel all along the Volga and threatened to spill into the serfs of Ryazan. Now Michael II wants to erase this shameful past and secure his rule and glory by pushing the Khanate to the Volga. An extensive campaign of conquest cannot be undertaken with the threat of the other princedoms but the Ryazanian court thought that reducing Tartar territory could only be helpful in the troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.A;To the Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR38.B;We cannot risk it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR39.T;Volga-Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.D;Ryazan has begun to avenge its past of humiliations at the hands of the steppe demons. Ryazanian armies swept the hordes of Kazan to the other side of the Volga and lands are already put to culture while our boats roam the Volga. Michael II returned to Ryazan hailed by the population and it seems to many of his neighbors that Ryazan will be a tough opponent in any fight to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.A;All hail Michael !;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR40.T;Setback in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.D;The plans of the Prince did not guarantee victory. It seems the Tatars are far from being uncivilized savages as many assumed, and our soldiers learnt it as they were forced back to our lands. Many wonder how Michael II could recover from such a blow to his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.A;How could it happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.T;An unstable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.D;Uniting our people under one banner was easy, but making them accept that Ukraine needs to endure as a modern state for the Cossack spirit not to die has been harder. Many want to continue the lives of their forefathers as free men in the Dyke Pole with no state to watch them. The next Rada will be decisive for the future of Ukraine and its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Let us go back to the Hosts of yore !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Ukraine will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.T;The visit of John Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.D;A strange man has appeared in Kharkov the other day. Claiming to be the son of a rich industrialist from Scotland, John Carnegie has apparently embarked on a trip throughout Eastern Europe to see the fierce and independent spirit of the Eastern Slavs in the open steppe. A romantic at heart, he has spent days with various Cossack hosts inspecting our borders and our lands, always astonished by our ways of life and the wilderness of our lands. He has proposed a partnership with the industrial conglomerate of his father to help $THIS$ develop although it will surely take years to be realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.A;A most peculiar visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.T;The creation of Karnegove;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.D;Following his last visit, John Carnegie has lobbied several bankers and fellow industrials to support his endeavors in our lands. Securing a large capital, he came back to Ukraine with the goal of building a metalwork factory in the Donbass where the abundance of coal is notorious. Our council of state has made him an honorary citizen of Ukraine and the town that sprung up around him was soon called 'Karnegove'. There, the finest steel of the East is produced and fuels a nascent industrialization of our nation. Carnegie has organized the factory on a 'socialist' model with schools and housing for his employees, hoping to create a perfect society in the middle of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.A;Steel makes us stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.T;The Donbass boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.D;The whole Donets basin is filled with coal and iron making it a natural area for industrialization to launch. Following the establishment of Karnegove several of the Cossack leaders have assembled in companies to exploit the riches of the Donbass, as foreign banks heavily invested in what many deem the 'best investment' there is right now in Europe. Many Cossacks have thus abandoned their small farms for the halls of the factories and the coal pits, ensuring the wealth of Ukraine and a rising standard of living throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.A;Let us all profit from this boom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.T;The lamentations of Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.D;Few news have reached us from the manor of Karnegove where the founder of the city has secluded himself for months. A mystical man at heart, he blames himself for the transformations of Ukraine and its people. His last speech to his employees  was written down by a journalist : 'Black smoke rises from the Ukrainian factories as it does in Scotland. Countless children are sacrificed in the pits or the factories where they once benefited from a humble but pure life in the Wild Fields...' He went on and on for nearly an hour before collapsing. The transformation is real, but at least his model factory continues to be a beacon of hope for many workers of the Donbass who crave the same housing and education provided in Karnegove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.A;A strange end for the Steelman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.T;Opening of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.D;"Rada" usually referred to an assembly of Cossack commanders, which were convened by the hetmans to resolve disputed issues. This time, however, the Rada looks quite different. At the Rada, which determines the structure and life of the unified Cossack state, absolutely everyone is allowed in, even ordinary soldiers, and they are given the same right to vote as the most influential commanders. Such an approach has increased the legitimacy of Ukraine and its Hetman, who is now respected by all parts of the Cossacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR46.A;Our fate is in our own hands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.T;Question of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.D;Despite the fact that Ukraine is considered a free land, in some Cossack hosts there is a wide layer of debt slaves and landless peasants who "voluntarily" work for the landowners. A large number of common Cossacks support the abolition of this system and the establishment of fair pay for all throughout Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.A;Serfdom in Ukraine? No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.B;We can't just abolish our customs...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.T;Question of State;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.D;The problem of host autonomy is perhaps the most pressing issue at this Rada. Despite the fact that the lands of Ukraine have been conquered by its unifier, local elites still count on some degree of autonomy. Will Ukraine be a centralized state, or a confederation of different regions, troops, and cities?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.A;The modern state have to be centralized!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.B;Confederation? Where have I heard that word before...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.T;Question of Military;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.D;At this point, our military forces are more like large bands than a regular army. Despite their combat effectiveness, Cossack military tactics are not formalized, and the creation of Western-style officer academies has not been successful. Few understand the need for modernization, and it is unclear whether their arguments will convince their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.A;United army for a united nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.B;No need to rush...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.T;Question of Voting rights;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.D;The Cossacks have a long tradition of collective decision-making. Often, even officers were elected from among the most respected soldiers, even if they were not the most competent tacticians and strategists... Obviously, the government in Ukraine will be elective, but the question is, who will elect it? It is clear to every Cossack that only the one holding a weapon in his hand has the right to choose, but the few liberals among the Cossack elite propose to give the right to vote to every man in Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.A;A voting citizen is a happy citizen.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.B;The right to vote has to be earned;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.T;Question of Hetman;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.D;The question of hetman rule had long been on the agenda. Not everyone likes the fact that a man once elected can count on power for the rest of his life, even if he no longer deserves it. A proposal was made to elect a hetman every few years, so that it would be clear that we are ruled by the most worthy one at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.A;Cossack Monarchy is our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.B;Long live the Cossack Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.T;Success of the Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.D;Despite the squabbles and arguments, those present at the Rada were still able to come to an agreement. The written Constitution of Ukraine will become the basis of our state and a symbol of unity of the Cossack people, which happened for the first time in 200 years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.T;Failure of the Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.D;Despite our seeming success in unifying Ukraine, we were unable to impose our will on the rest of the hosts. The draft Constitution of Ukraine, proposed by the Hetman, was a dismal failure, destroying his authority in the eyes of even his closest supporters. Various influential figures are already declaring themselves hetmans and restoring their independence, and it is up to us whether this process will be peaceful or whether we will once again show our strength and bring our enemies to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.A;A dream of Ukraine is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.B;To arms, khloptsi!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.T;Collapse of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.D;The situation at the Rada has heated up to the limit. Grouped into small parties, the Cossack elite and its subordinates cannot agree on a single issue. The word of the Hetman decides nothing, and no one listens to his opinion anymore. The elite accuses him of letting the "mob" into the Rada, while ordinary Cossacks blame him for compromises and his inability to demonstrate his leadership, for which he was loved by the soldiers. Delegations leave the Rada, and it has become clear to everyone that it is impossible to unite Ukraine by force of words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.T;Victory over separatists;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.D;Despite the fact that the starting situation in this civil war seemed deplorable, we were able to subdue all the rebellious areas and establish our authority there. Now that we have no serious political opponents left, we can implement our vision for the future of Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR56.T;Ruina;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.D;The war has exhausted the resources of all sides. We could not defeat the separatists, which means that dreams of a united Ukraine have been postponed for several more decades, if not forever. Weakened and divided, the land of the Cossacks is now open to conquest from all sides...;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.A;What have we done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR57.T;The Threat of Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR57.D;Our Khan has heard ill tidings from the North. The Russian polities, seemingly trapped in a circuitous conflict between themselves that would never end, have escaped this cycle and united their people. With their jingoistic attitude and focus on expanding their military to a massive size, it is likely that one day we will be under threat. This has caused a crisis and panic to descend upon the state. This panic has caused new inventions and information to be purchased from the Far West in an attempt to quickly modernize the country in response to these fundamental threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR57.A;Will information shelter us from a bullet or blade?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.T;Our Old Nemesis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.D;Our position as the protector of all Russian people is under threat. History has repeated itself many times, and no event more so than with the long history of Asiatic hordes coming to the Russian land and stamping the people down. The Russian people have been butchered, forcefully moved, and even enslaved by the old hordes of the past. The current Tatar state is intrinsically linked to these hordes and holds animosity toward the Russian people. So as long as the Tatars remain united and strong, we will never be truly safe from the attacks that are guaranteed to soon take place. The only answer that our generals, advisors, and people will accept is the utter destruction of the Tatar state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR58.A;The choice is simple. We will avenge the Russians that came before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.T;Rumors Swirl;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.D;It seems our gravest fears have been confirmed. Rumors and whispers tell of the Russian army preparing for an expedition southward towards our territory. It seems very unlikely that this movement is anything less than an attempt at the outright destruction of our state and the subsequent enslavement of the Tatar people. Without preparation, we will be caught completely flat-footed. Our armies already are less equipped than their Russian counterparts, we will need to take all the time possible to ready our troops. This information has been kept somewhat secret for now, the Khan has ordered that we continue to prepare military defenses on the border for this seemingly inevitable conflict that will decide the fate of all Tatars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR59.A;Bolster our defenses! We will hold back this tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.T;A Standstill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.D;We have been humbled. It was thought impossible that a union of the Russian people would have been able to be defeated by any one enemy however, we have been proven incorrect. On the fields of battle, the Russian army has been unable to force a decisive defeat upon the Tatar hordes. Every fight has ended without either side able to complete their victory over the other, towns and villages have been sacked on both sides of the border. With our backs to the wall, we have been forced to sign a white peace with their government.  The people are shocked at these events and we will be recovering for some time from the disastrous fallout of this military failure. For now, it seems that the Tatar question will remain unsolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR60.A;We will be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR61.T;Fixing Past Mistakes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR61.D;The glory of this day shall never be forgotten by the Russian people. The outdated and ill-led Tatar military was easily overwhelmed and routed on the battlefield. Their Khan was even killed in the ensuing rout, with some of our Cossacks riding him down. Leaderless and without hope, their nation has completely disintegrated. With this stunning victory it seems we will have no contenders or objectors to our expansion further south towards the Cacuseses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR61.A;Forward march! For Mother Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR62.T;Invaders Beaten Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR62.D;Glorious victory! Our horses, steeled with courage and hope, have with fire and sword drove the invaders back. It was thought unlikely or even impossible by outside observers for our state to successfully route the numerous and well-equipped Russian army, but they were proven wrong today! With this victory, the Khan has ordered three days of celebration to take place, in honor of the victory and those that died to achieve it. Long live the Tatar people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
TAR62.A;Three days? How about six!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TAR63.T;Invaders Beaten Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##################### Malta Stuff (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MLT1.T;An old and sick Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.D;The Order of Saint John has settled in Malta back in 1573, liberating the land from the Ottoman corsairs that had settled there. Our legacy endures but right now the current Grandmaster, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval would take advantage of this state to call a new election. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, Pons De Margarit de Biure, Montfort-Laval and his supporters will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean, although the Plantagenet king is already the official patron of the order. For the moment, the island is calm but who knows for how long ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.A;Trouble is brewing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.T;The Grandmaster of Malta ill;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.D;News have reached the European court that the current Grandmaster of the order of Saint John, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval has expressed that he wanted to take advantage of this state to call a new election, considering Cheschi unfit to maintain his power. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, he will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.A;How will it play ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.T;Death of the Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT3.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MLT4.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose our loyal supporter, Pons de Margarit de Biure to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT4.A;A most auspicious news !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.T;Death of the Maltese Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.D;Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, has finally died after a decade of suffering. With the general status quo continuing in Malta and the Western Mediteranean at large, the Holy Council soon chose the Aragonese Pons de Margarit de Biure, to succeed him as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order, and the first originating from the Aragonese tongue in a century. Jean de Montfort-Laval's influence has plummeted over the years and the man could do nothing against this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT5.A;A failed opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.T;Change in Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.D;The crown of Aragon has been the feudal overlord of the Order because the island belonged to the crown of Sicily before the Alfonsine concession of 1579. But now Aragon has lost the island and many wonder what it entails for Malta. Several groups have agitated in the previous days : the Knights are commonly hated by the population and many wish to throw them out the island for good. Among these factions many Irrendentists wish the island to join with their Italian brothers in Sicily. But in the end the Knights still possess the artillery and weapons and could try to crush this uprising. Who shall dictate the path of Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.A;The independent Republic of Malta!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.B;Malta must embrace the Italian cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.C;Knights hold out and declare sovereignity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.T;A Republic in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.D;Following our loss of the Sicilian island the Knights of Malta were ousted from the island by a popular uprising who declared an independant Republic, breaking all ties they had with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT7.A;An independant Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.T;An envoy from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.D;Following our victory over the Aragonese Crown, the citizens of Malta ended the rule of the Knights over them and have now declared their intention to join our state !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT8.A;Viva $COUNTRY$ !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.T;Malta joins Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.D;Following our defeat in Sicily, the Maltese crowds soon ousted the Knights and declared their intention to join those who now occupy the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT9.A;The nail in the coffin...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.T;Independence of the Order;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.D;With our loss of the island of Sicily, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John has proclaimed that he did not have to honour the old contract that binded the order with our Crown and proclaimed the independence of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT10.A;But ... the Alfonsine concession ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.T;The Maltese uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.D;The hold on the Knights grew weaker over the years as the newfound independence gave several ideas to the Maltese intellectuals who already hated the Knights when they were just 'Aragonese lapdogs'. Following several economic crises and scandals involving Knights and especially the head of the English tongue, the Nationalists decided to organize a demonstration in the capital of Porto Ferrante. From there Ugo Buhagiar, leader of the Nationalists tried to lead his supporters to take the Palace of the Grandmaster and proclaim the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.A;The Grandmaster is toppled : long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.B;The crowd is dispersed by the Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.T;A meeting in Marseilles;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.D;Jean de Montfort-Laval was never meant to become a Knight. The first heir of one of the greatest noble families of the Kingdom, he had to flee and become a Knight following a duel provoked by a remark of the poet Maurice de la Rochefoucauld over his sister. Arriving in Malta at the age of 21 he soon used his prestige and charisma to climb the levels of the order and become the second most powerful man in Malta. With our conquest of the Valois duchy, he has come on an embassy to negotiate officially the status of the Provence tongue possessions in our Kingdom. But in private he has asked for the support of the Rex Christianissimus, should the Grandmaster step down, and promised us to become our foremost ally in the Mediteranean. His ambitions may be high, but Malta could be used as a friendly base on the road to the Levant and would foremost lower the power of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.A;The Pact of Marseilles is signed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.T;The Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT13.D;For years, the young head of the Auvergne tongue, Jean de Montfort-Laval has criticized the current Grandmaster for holding on to power while his life resumes to lying in bed or visiting sanatoriums. The pressure has been high for Pietro Cheschi who finally decided to abdicate following the latest attacks in the Holy Council. A new election is to be called to select the 75th Grandmaster and it will surely be a contentious one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.A;Let us thanks Pietro Cheschi for his service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.T;Abdication of Pietro Cheschi;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT14.D;The Grandmaster of the order of Malta has abdicated because of his bad health. At least that's the official version : the head of the Aragonese tongue has contacted us to inform us of the latest maneuvers of the Dual-Monarchy, patron of the Order since the XVIIth century and which currently supports the young Jean de Montfort-Laval. Our ambassadors fear that they may try to place their puppet to increase their influence and make the island their possession and not ours. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.A;The election is a game we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.T;A contentious election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT15.D;The election of the 75th Grandmaster is contentious. Montfort-Laval hoped to win the election without any problems, but his influence is as high as the hatred and contempt he inspires many of his brothers. The head of the German tongue, Karl Von Preysling, has even retired to the German inn in the port, refusing to take part in the process because of the irregularities he has witnessed. For now the election is thus blocked...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.A;Such infighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.T;News from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT16.D;As the prime Catholic nation of Europe, we have an interest in the direction of the Order of Saint John in Malta, with most of the German knights hailing from our country or our allies. The Apostolic legate in Prague has contacted us because the head of the German tongue (administrative division of the order) in Malta, Karl von Preysling is blocking the election process of the Grandmaster because of his personal hatred of the main candidate Jean de Montfort-Laval. We exert a lot of influence amongst the German brothers and could force Von Preysling to come back to the table of negotiations. The Pope has informed us that the rivalry between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy is a great concern : we could push Von Preysling to make a bid to become Grandmaster and establish a new relation of the Order with his patrons, or we could just instruct him to end the election as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.A;The Kaiser wants Von Preysling to become Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.B;The Kaiser just wants the end of this political drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interference;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT17.D;The election is not as smooth as Monfort promised us. He has been challenged because of his youth and of several rivalries he made since his arrivals. Among these, the offended Karl von Preysling has recently come back to the Holy Council for the election, proposing himself as a neutral and peaceful choice for Grandmaster. We had heard of the interest of the Prague court in these matters but we did not envision they would use their influence for such a thing. Several Italian knights have joined Von Preysling because of Papal manipulations and we are now forced to demand Spain to put pressure on their knights in the Portuguese and Castilian tongues to ensure that our investment in Montfort-Laval succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.A;Contact the Spanish ambassador, they will feel important for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.T;A demand from Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT18.D;The Order of Saint John has convened for a new election following the retirement of the previous Grandmaster. Our influence there is not so strong with the Spanish knights representing a fringe minority in the ranks of the Order but as the election grows more decisive the Anglois choice of Jean de Montfort-Laval faces increased competition. The head of the Spanish knights, Pedro de Olivares has yet to pronounce his judgement and our friends in Paris have asked us for our support. Supporting them is the best course of action since it will surely weaken Aragon while enhancing our position in European diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.A;Contact Olivares, he has a favour to honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.T;Ending the stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT19.D;Factionalism has grown over the previous weeks as European diplomats sent various messages to Malta to instruct the Knights from the wishes of the sovereigns of their homelands. 3 candidates are still in the competition : Jean de Montfort-Laval's ambitions are still strong and he hopes to end the current situation of the Order with Aragon thanks to the protection of Paris counting on the support of most of the Anglois and Spanish knights. On the other hand Pons Margarit de Biure proclaims that he is a traitor and can count on the votes of the Aragonese knights. Meanwhile Karl von Preysling has come back, promoting himself as a compromise candidate, who with the backing of the Papacy and the Emperor in Prague wishes to affirm neutrality from both Aragon and Dual-Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.A;Karl von Preysling becomes the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.B;Monfort-Laval wins despite all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.C;Margarit de Biure confirms the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.T;A new situation in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT20.D;Our candidate in the election has lost but at least the Anglois Montfort did as well! The new German knight has the support of Prague and also Rome, as the Holy Father has been angered by the various intrigues that plagued the succession of Pietro Cheschi. The Apostolic legate has thus drafted a plan that would see our feudal contract ended with the Order while making sure that the archipelago would not be used by a foreign power against us, notably the Dual-Monarchy. With the intervention of the Pope it seems hard to go against this situation and Malta isn't really worth the hassle after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.B;We don't accept the Convention!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.T;The Convention of Porto Ferrante;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT21.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, he asked the Aragonese King to change the feudal contract that binded the Order to the King of Sicily by assuming neutrality in the Mediteranean. Following the vicious infighting that the election caused, this solution was supported by the Curia who had sent the first draft to Barcelona about this new situation. Malta would be ceded to the Order in full, with the Knights promising to observe neutrality outside of their protection duties. The Convention was then signed in Porto Ferrante by both representatives from the Anglois and Aragonese Kings, leading to the end of their relationships with the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.A;The Knights protect the island and nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.T;The Maltese Falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT22.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling received a letter of thanks for his support along with a magnificent Maltese Falcon. The bird had been the symbol of the feudal relationship between the Order and Barcelona and Karl von Preysling had decided that it was only fitting that his Imperial Majesty received the last of these gifts. The animal would be given to Princess Elisabeth, the first born of the Emperor who would begin a tradition of hunting with only Maltese falcons. Along with her other eccentricities, the bird would become a symbol, many of the Bohemian Imperial family members being painted or later taking photos of them with these Falcons, often nicknamed the 'Imperial Falcon'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.A;The Bohemian Eagle deserves such a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.T;Election of Montfort-Laval;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT23.D;What we feared happen, the Anglois protégé and ambitious knight, Jean de Montfort-Laval was elected by the Holy Council to lead the Order. For now he has publicly sent us our Maltese Falcon as a sign of his submission to the current agreements between the Order and our sovereign but behind closed doors, it is no secret that he dreams of an independent Malta, with him girdling a Crown...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.A;We will have to watch him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.T;An ally in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT24.D;Our ally, Jean de Montfort-Laval has won the election in Malta. In a secret letter to our goverment he has assured us that he will move quite soon against the current status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.A;New opportunites arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.T;The Grand-principality of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT25.D;The Order of Saint-John has been criticzed for decades about his general lack of utility in the modern world. With piracy in the Mediteranean ended, they have been left without a cause and hated by the general population of the archipelago because of the heavy taxation. The latest Grandmaster, Jean de Montfort-Laval took advantage of this situation to coup the Holy Council, the administrative head of the Order by declaring himself Grand-Prince of Malta, and nationalising the Order, while allowing the Knights who swore fealty to him to remain. He then promulgated a charter to associate the Maltese elites, making him vastly popular on the islands. Now, even with the Anglois protection he must face the Aragonese who are still the de jure masters of the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.A;Long live our Prince !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.T;A prince in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT26.D;The proclamation of the Grandmaster as Prince of Malta and the nationalisation of the order surprised many despite the knowledge that he was up to some scheme. But now we are faced with a dilemma : either we recognize the actions of 'John I' of Malta and his independence or we will have to fight the Dual-Monarchy who has already recognized the new monarch of the islands. Is Malta really worth a war with the greatest power of Europe ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.A;Recognize his independence, he only rules three worthless rocks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.B;The archipelago is a possession of the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.T;Safe from Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT27.D;The gamble from the Prince had worked : Aragon forfeited its claims over our archipelago, fearful of the protection from our friends in Paris. It is a new era for Malta, which is now independent. To celebrate this, John I decided to sail back to his homeland to thank the Anglois court for their support (and secure a wedding prospect now that he had been liberated from his vows), and upholding his promise of being a trusted ally in the Mediteranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.A;All is calm in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.T;The election of Pons Margarit de Biure;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.D;Pons Margarit de Biure, head of the Aragonese tongue of the Knights of Saint John has been elected Grandmaster of the Order. This news was met with joy in Barcelona given that he was the candidate of the King and the only one who supported the current relationship Malta has with the Crown. He also has opposed the Anglois interests in the islands, denouncing in particular Jean de Montfort-Laval who was accused of treason and thrown into prison following the discovery of several letters indicating his plots against the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.A;Long live the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT29.T;The election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.D;Karl von Preysling has finally come back to his senses, announcing his support of Margarit de Biure against Jean de Montfort-Laval. With the German knights denouncing him along with a general lack of support from most of the various tongues, the chances of Montfort being elected have quite faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.A;Jean de Montfort-Laval wins despite the fierce opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.B;Pons de Margarit de Biure wins a large victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT30.T;A princely visit;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.D;The new prince of Malta has come to Paris following the celebrations of the new Maltese independence and the general reorganization of the state. As he is welcomed by the King, ministers discuss the new alliance between the archipelago and the Dual-Monarchy, securing the use of the naval bases in times of peace and war. Anglois capitalists discuss the opening of this new market while the Prince announced his marriage to the third removed cousin of the King, the duchess of Longueville. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.A;A new era for Malta and the Dual-Monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
##################### Synøe Events (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.T;The Pearl of the Antilles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.D;The Southern Islands, or as we call them the Synøe, are the pride of the Scandinavian colonial empire. The archipelago comprised of the main island of Kiskøyene and the secondary island of Righavn, is one of the main sources of colonial products be it sugar, coffee or chocolate. The slave population far surpasses the local settlers who come mainly from Scandinavia although many of the lower classes trace their ancestry to some Scottish clans deported them for their support during the Anglois occupation in the XVIIIth century. This pearl of the Antilles relies on slavery and we are sure to hear the settlers demand concessions if we were to abolish this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.A;It's not on the agenda, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.T;The Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.D;The law outlawing slavery has passed following a growth of Liberal thought in our country. But in the Caribbean this Act of the Rigsdag has seen wide condemnation from the settlers who condemn idealists knowing nothing of their lives and the benefits of slavery. They demand that the state assumes the financial loss they have to suffer because of the Act, a compromise many Liberals accept because of the infringment on private property this Act represents.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.A;We will pay for the emancipation of their slaves. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.B;Paying for having freed men, what nonsense is this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.T;The Kiskøyener Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.D;Pamphlets and slogans flourish in the Caribbean against Scandinavian rule following the refusal of Copenhagen to consider the side of the Kiskøyener planters. For many this is another sign that the relationship with the metropolis must end, as the island has no representation in Parliament and must always abide to the laws dictated by men who know nothing of the life in the Southern Islands. The Kiskøyener manifesto from Peter MacKristian is the most known of these works, and has become the main subject of conversation amongst the White population.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.A;They are just a colony, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.T;The independence of the Republic of Kiskøyene;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.D;As the situation of our state grew dire in the Antilles and abroad, the resistance against our rule increased. In these new circumstances, the old Planter elite along with the rest of the population declared the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, throwing away the representatives of Copenhagen and cutting ties with the metropolis.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.A;These islands were a burden anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.B;We will reconquer the Synøe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.T;The new Kiskøyener movement;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.D;In the last decades of the XIXth century, the islands of Sydøen experienced a national awakening. Distance from the motherland along with a difference in climate and general society had always made the Creole natives wary of the 'Northern' administrators. But the abolition of slavery led to a greater miscegenation among the lower classes, and the growing sentiment that the various populations, in all their differences, from the 'pure' Scandinavian Creole planters, to the mixed lower classes born from the mixing of Highlanders, Danish sailors and African slaves, had a common destiny and formed one nation. From autonomists to nationalists, all clamour for a new relationship with Scandinavia, which should hear them if it doesn't want conflict to erupt on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.A;Sydøen or Kiskøyene, call it as you want!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.T;The Sydøen dominion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.D;Demands of autonomy have grown over the years in our Antillean colonies, their people demanding a new relationship with the metropolis. As their societies developed and grew, it seemed inevitable to many that the Scandinavian government would have to grant them some power. It seems the easier way to maintain our control over these islands would be to associate them as a Dominion of the Crown, with their diplomacy aligned with the decisions in Copenhagen while leaving them masters of their economy, health and education. We could refuse that deal, but it would bolster the nationalist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.A;We welcome the new dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.B;They are not developed enough for that.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.C;We welcome the new dominion ! (play as them);;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.T;Competition in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.D;The rise of the New World powers has been a great concern for Scandinavia in the later years. Many Kiskøyener nationalists created exiled networks in these countries, rising public opinion against us. Then, they started coming back, harrassing the colonial police over the previous weeks. Now the situation has grown dire, with most of our forces in the islands trapped by the nationalists who proclaimed the independent United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, waiting for their benefactor to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.T;Fight for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.D;The day has come! We will not let the Scandinavian oppress us anymore, it is time to rise up or die free!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.A;Liberty or Death!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.T;A Contact from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.D;The inhabitants of the islands of Kiskøyene and Righavn have risen up against the Scandinavian oppressor and demand our help. For several years we hosted exiles and trained some of their men in hope to reduce European influence in the Caribbean, now is the time!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.A;Europeans must go back to Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.B;It is better not to provoke them...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which have already declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.A;Our Navy will sail the Atlantic to end this petty republic.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.B;Let it go...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.D;The pathetic attempts of the Sydøer to gain the support of the powers of the New World have failed. They stand alone agains the might of Scandinavia and it will be easy for our Navy to end their dreams of independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.A;Let us sail for the Sydøen!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.B;Perhaps we should let them alone ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.T;Scandinavian decline;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.D;As Scandinavian power declined on the world stage over the years, the hopes of the nationalists in Sydøen rose. Our might is not what it was, and the locals saw it as less ships and colonial forces were put in the islands. In this situation, the nationalists gathered over the previous weeks, harassing local police forces and soldiers. Yesterday they felt strong enough to storm the palace of the governor and declare the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.A;It can't end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.T;The reconquest of the Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which might have declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.A;Weigh, me boys, to Sydoe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.B;We better not ...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.T;Suðurhafseyjar;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.D;Published in $YEAR$, the book 'The South Sea Islands' from Hans Johannesson was soon recognized as a monument of Icelandic litterature, and following his translation of the whole Scandinavian literature. Inspired by the life of the author who himself lived several years in the colony of Sydøen, the book describes the travels of a poor Icelandic, Sigurd Hansson. Following the deaths of his mother and sister he is forced to leave his homeland because of the misery he lives in. Arriving in Righavn he relates the beauty of this exotic land, only to witness the darker side of the Sydøen society : while slavery is abolished, the narrator witnesses the violence of the old masters on their freed workers and how Afro-Kiskøyener are only second-class citizens in the islands. Eventually the story ends on a note of hope, the Icelandic finding happiness after settling in a small village of the Kiskøyene interior with his wife. While praised for its literary quality by the various literary critics of Copenhagen and beyond, the book was also vividly criticized by Kiskøyener for his critics of their society along with the end chapter implying that the narrator marries a Black woman. Nonetheless, the attention the book received made the Synoe colony widely known as the 'Suðurhafseyjar' in the rest of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Neo-Guelphist solution proposes that Italy be organized as a loose confederation headed by the Pope, which would respect the various laws of the provinces that would join while still forming a united Italian polity.

savoie_at_fuck_italy_desc;While Savoy has been under Italian rule for centuries, that does not negate the fact that the francophone Romand people exist as the majority inhabitants of the region. Thus, Savoy is much closer culturally to the Burgundian sphere than it is to the Italian sphere, giving us justification to take the territory. As the Italian peninsula is still recovering from the chaos that accompanied unification, we can seize this opportunity to press our claims on Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TUS1.T;The Buonaparte Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.D;The proclamation of the duchy of Genoa by the former Doge Lodovico Della Rovere was not accepted by all in the Republic. Troubles brewed in Corsica for the past years, the island being notoriously hard to administer for the Ligurians. Eventually, the chief of the garrison of the island, Pietro Buonaparte declared that the Duke was an usurpator and that no Corsican would bow to the whims of a monarch. Without a fight, the various soldiers scattered around the island surrendered as Buonaparte was proclaimed Dictator of the Corsican Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.A;A rebellious island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.T;The Republican threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.D;The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the ending of the Genoan republic that had existed for centuries and was done thanks to his grip over the army. But lately his autocratic rule has alienated him several officers and throughout Liguria many resent him from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. With the Buonaparte insurrection in Corsica, some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some supports and is well prepared to face his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.A;The rebellion is crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.B;Lodovico I flees the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.T;Savoy and Genoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.D;The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows little signs of wanting to fight for his former title. For the court of our Duke, it is a wonderful opportunity : Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly- lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.A;The Duke of Savoy is the rightful Duke of Liguria:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.B;It isn't worth the cost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.T;Stabilization of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.D;Overthrowing the tyran Della Rovere did not bring a peaceful restoration of the old order. Patricians squabbled among themselves for political positions while the Duke of Savoy gathered armies on the border. But in the end all was resolved when the Dictator of Corsica, Pietro Buonaparte accepted the office of Doge and brought back the island into the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.A;La Superba will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.T;The matter of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.D;Politics of Etruria have been growing more and more polarized after the revolutionary support for the short-lived Sicilian Republic ended in failure. Conservatives have taken back the upper hand in the legislature and government but Liberals still exert a vast influence. With the Corsican revolt ending the tyranny of Lodovico Della Rovere, many Republicans hoped that he would grant more liberties to the Corsican people. But eventually, Buonaparte ended ruling with an iron fist over the island, while members of the Society of the Commons were declared bandits and outlaws. Now the Republic must decide to either support the 'Protector of Corsica' who is still an ardent Republican, or support the underground factions of the Commons. His rule is far from assured and a few weapons and official support could easily lead to a popular uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.A;Stability is paramount : support Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.B;A republic without freedom means nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.T;The deposition of Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.D;After months of local infighting between the supporters of Buonaparte and the popular movements, Etruria finally offered her support to the Commons. A Tuscan ship boarded the Eastern Coast, supplying Antonio Paoli, former officer under Buonaparte, weapons to act. His partisans crossed the maquis and finally arrived in Corte where Buonaparte had established his government. The fighting was swift as partisans attacked the city from all sides, with Buonaparte surrendering mere minutes after the beginning of the attack. The manifesto of the Commons was soon printed en masse and shared throughout the island with the various villages and families of Corsica rejoicing over the new state of affairs. The first action of the Paoli government was to proclaim an alliance with Etruria and vowing to help in the overthrow of the Old order in Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.A;Viva Corsica!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.T;Revolution in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.D;Following the official support of the Etrurian republic for the Commons in Corsica, weapons were given to the leader of the resistance Antonio Paoli who then took nearly without any blood spilled the city of Corte where the government was hosted. A democratic Republic has been established in Corsica and Buonaparte will face a trial for his crimes agains the people. Paoli has pledged to support us in any endeavours we may face against the Reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.A;Now Corsica, soon all of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.T;The election of 1838;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.D;The Etrurian Republic has been experimenting a Byzantine system of government whose all goal is to prevent the rise of either Reactionaries or Radical Revolutionaries to power. The Republic is ruled through Councils that choose various the ministers and consuls of the Republic. Among the various councils the most important is the 200 Council, which is partially elected every 3 years, with one third of the seats to be filled in the coming election. The current legislature is divided, and despite the censitary vote in effect, the Republicans have a great chance at gaining a large majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.A;Who will win ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.D;After the votes were counted the 200 Council saw a Moderate majority seated. Among the members of the Society of the Commons, rumors spread of a plot to extinguish the Revolutionary flame once and for all by confiscating the election. The people was soon in arms in Florence, while soldiers were divided on how to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.A;The people end the Moderate governement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.B;The army sides with the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.D;The Republicans ended up winning the election, notably thanks to the vote of the soldiers, exempted from having to require to pay taxes to vote. But the Moderate Consuls did not intent to let the Republicans take power in the Republic. They soon called upon the army to storm the Parliament and arrest Republicans. Street fights were undecisive as many soldiers preferred to side with the popular movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.A;The Moderates restore Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.B;The Republicans crush the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is a threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our rights to the grand duchy of Tuscany. Medicis have ruled the city of Florence for 4 centuries and it is time we renew with this tradition. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power. It would be a perfect occasion as the Republic is currenty divided and the rebels squabbling among themselves. What do we choose ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TUS11.T;A stable Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.D;The Revolution has now ended. For too many years, Liberals and secret societies seeked to embroil Etruria once again in war against our Holy Faith and the various monarchs of the peninsula. While it is true that overthrowing the Old Order was justified we must take a diplomatic stance rather than risk a war we cannot win. Etruria will thus abandon the violence of the past years but not the Italian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.A;Nessuna rivoluzione ma nessun Antico Regime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.T;A revolutionary Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.D;The Revolution has been hampered for too many years by the Moderate efforts to acquire 'normalized relations' with the reactionary states that surround us which only paved the way for the Provencal attempt to restore the Antico Regime. The people has been heard, and the Etrurian Republic will not stop until all Italy is liberated from its oppresive monarchs and foreign tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.A;Unione Forza e Liberta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.T;An opportunity in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.D;The current attempt of the Duke of Provence to reclaim Tuscany allows us to more easily take Corsica, which is a rightful part of the Duchy of Genoa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.A;The island will accept its new master by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS13.B;What could we do with Corsica ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.T;Reclaiming Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.D;The duchy of Lucca is an artificial construction of the partisans of the Antico Regime. Following the peace of Lucca of 1814 the Gonzaga of Milan organized the creation of a monarchist state in Lucca and also encompassing the former duchy of Massa with Jean of Valois-Forcalquier, cousin of the King in France, proclaimed monarch of this petty state. His daughter Marguerite who succeeded him in 1827 enjoys little sympathy from the population and it will not be hard for our armies to bring back the Revolution to these territories:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.A;Lucca is Etrurian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.T;Ending the Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.D;Following the foolish attempt of Alessandro IV of Parma to establish a Constitutional Kingdom of Italy in the 1820's, his domains were split between his cousins Alessandro V in Parma and Ferdinando in Modena. Both claim the duchy of Massa from Lucca and have sent demands of aid to all the other monarchs in Italy, or so our spy networks tell us. We must end these petty duchies and united the people of Emilia in our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.A;Onwards to Parma and Modena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.T;The Romagnol uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.D;Romagna was the second centre of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of Bologna had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, the order came back to Romagna and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors from the oldest university of Europe. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. But with our brothers in Tuscany having rekindled the flame of liberty, secret societies in Bologna have risen the tricolor and the Papal officials were forced to flee as the revolutionaries decided to join with Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.A;Italia unita !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.T;Romagna joins us !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.D;Our success in Italy and our support for revolutionaries has rekindled the revolutionary fervour in Romagna. From the Liberal bastion of Bologna, where many of our leaders have been formed, the Patriots rose against the Papal garrison and agents who were thrown out. Then the Bologna assembly decided to join back Etruria to advance the National and Revolutionary cause. While an interesting prospect for us, it also enraged the Papacy who consider that we have invaded their territory. We might soon hear from Aragonese threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.A;Viva Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.T;Loss of Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.D;Romagna has risen against our power and pledged itself to the heathen radicals of Etruria. Always a hotbed of radicalism and agitation, it seems our rule through the use of the Inquisition alienated the good people of Romagna. The Papal army is weak, and Etruria has engineered many plots over the years so the Curia is weary of trying to fight them. We will wait for our Aragonese protectors to help us in that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.A;The Church has endured for centuries, we can endure such a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.T;Commons in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.D;Memories from the 1827 and 1828 uprising that saw the creation of the Neapolitan and Sicilian Republics are still vividly remembered in our Republic along with the restoration of order that followed by the tyrannous Catalans. All revolutionaries know it : the main menace for the Republic comes from Barcelona for it is because of Barcelona that the Pope still reigns with an iron fist over Central Italy. With our success in restoring Republican rule over Central Italy, the networks of the Commons Societies in Southern Italy have gathered again. We could begin help them organize so that they would rise should Aragon decide to try to end the Revolution. However such a move would be hard to hide from Catalan spies and could give further reasons to the Catalans to attack us ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.A;Il suon d'ogni squilla i Vespri suonò!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.B;We have learnt from 1828, leave the Southern peasants on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.T;The second Italian Coalition war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.D;As many aristocrats and conservatives flock into Naples, we are forced to admit that the old Revolutionary threat in Tuscany has grown again and threatens our hegemony. We must gather our forces and restore order to Northern Italy lest we see the Green-White-Red tricolour fly over Rome, Naples and Palermo! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.A;God is with us in this holy war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.B;We can’t risk our holdings…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.T;The Second Parthonepean Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.D;Our attack against Tuscany has rallied the unruly crowds of Napoli who have risen once again against our rule. Hopefully their rule does not extend over the whole South given their opposition to Santamarians, but they can still pose a threat to our current war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.A;End this petty ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.T;The Napolitan and Sicilian uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.D;Etrurian agents had been plotting against us for years and they had sent agents to Napoli and Sicily to create a network of informants and rebels they could arm should we go to war with them. With our armies rallied to fight the Tuscan insurgents in the North, the Italian tricolour was flown over the citadel of Naples and much of Sicily, the revolutionaries hoping to win their freedom. Hopefully, we can squash these revolts again and teach the Southerners that Order is paramount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.A;We will win !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.T;Proposal of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.D;A proposal has come from the Republic of Etruria. Having abandoned their revolutionary heritage for reason, they have proposed a peaceful unification of the Peninsula in a weak confederation that would be headed by the Pope while preserving the rights of all members and its own laws. This could be an interesting proposal to end the bickering between Italian statelets and avoid a forceful unification like dreamed about by the Savoyards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.A;This is a very interesting proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.B;We are better off alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.C;This is a very interesting proposal (Switch to Tuscany);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.T;Formation of the Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.D;Italian nationalism has never really gone away despite the end of Revolution in Italy. As threats grow, the Pope, the Republic of Tuscany and Milano have decided to join in a Confederation that will be headed by his Holiness. The rights of all states adhering to the Confederation will be respected, with the Confederal government only in charge of war, trade and diplomacy. This Confederation is already very criticized, notably in Savoy who has been a prime opponent of the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.A;One Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.T;Failure of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.D;The Council we had assembled to create a new Italian Confederation ended after the refusal of several members to join…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.A;It was just a dream after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.T;Crossing the Po;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.D;The Etrurian hydra roars again. Terrorists strike in all Italy while the barbarous legions of Florence have exiled the Farnese from their duchies. Leopoldo I stands ready to end the Etrurian menace once again as he did in his youths when hordes of peasants and atheists had taken the ancestral seat of his family in Mantua, and end once and for all the threat they pose to the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.A;Florence will be freed from barbary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.B;Crossing the river would be foolish : watch the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.T;Milanese attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.D;The Milanese Duke has decided to attack us, citing various grievances, notably the annexation of his cousins’ duchies in Emilia. His goal is nothing less than walking over Florence and end the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.A;To Arms Citizens !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.T;The Transpadan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.D;Our forces have vanquished the Gonzaga duke, who is now in exile in Germany. Our forces secured the help of local revolutionaries who have been put in charge of the new Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.A;With this, the Revolution grows stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.T;The Borgia charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.D;Following the victory over the Republic of Etruria, Duke Leopoldo was approached by his daughter-in-law Maria Borgia. She exposed that Italy could not continue to be divided into petty states. Milan having defeated Etruria was the prime pretender to the defunct Kingdom of Italy and it could only come if a Charter was drafted to ensure stability and lessen the threat of the Republicans. By abdicating, Leopoldo, already aged, could secure a swift succession that could realize this idea and fight for the rights of Maria to Southern Italy. But he could also hold onto power and try to unite Northern Italy in a neutral confederation with the Pope, as suggested by Neo-Guelphists...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.A;An Italian confederation will preserve stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.B;The Charter is the first step to a unified Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.T;Marianist insurrection in Naples!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.D;Following the promulgation of the so-called 'Borgia Charter' by the Duke of Milan, Maria Borgia headed to Naples to claim her lost crown. Supported by Marianist networks, the garrison was soon overwhelmed and she could enter the city with minimal resistance. With the fall of the city, the countryside followed as many lords changed allegiances and peasants joined the Marianist banditry. War will come soon to the Boot of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.A;If one abdication is not enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.T;The March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.D;The South has heard the call of her rightful sovereign as crowds gather to be armed and fight the Aragonese throughout the Kingdom of Naples. Between our current possessions and the South lie the prize of Italy, Rome still governed by the Church. The Pope has refused to grant us access, stating that Maria had no rights to Naples since her abdication. We have no choice but to declare war on the Papal State to make sure that the Marianists are not isolated in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.A;If we can take Rome in the process ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.T;The unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.D;When Maria Borja, queen of Aragon was deposed by Josep Serna in 1835 no one thought that she could become Queen again. The masses of the South rose to her call to fight Aragon. After a successful march on Rome she joined the armies of her husband Massimiliano Maria Visconti and managed to force Aragon to recognize her as the legitimate sovereign of Naples. With their victory over Etruria and the Aragonese, Massimiliano and Maria were eventually proclaimed the rightful sovereigns of Italy, despite the Pope, a mere puppet of Barcelona, refusing to accept this new order. Challenges await the Visconti-Borgia as Italy is yet to be completely united but crowds rejoice, for it has been centuries since the end of the Kingdom of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.A;Viva Massimiliano! Viva Maria ! Viva Italia ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.T;La Regina Margot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.D;The first representation of the new play of Dominico Rezzi, 'La Regina Margherita' was met with great acclaim in Milan. It retells the story of the Great Italian War (1539-1546) originating in the succession of Margherita I de Valois on the throne of Milan. Breaking with the classical rules, the play mixes tragical elements with grotesque scenes. The author notably represented the death of Francesco de Valois, duke of Milan during the Italian Wars, in an undignified manner that was criticized by many critics. The success of the play can be partially explained by the nationalist subtext : Margherita, the duchess of Milan must choose between a Borja and a Plantagenet to marry and her eventual wedding to the Dauphin is seen as the lesser of two evils both for her and for Italy. After a dozen of representations the play  was censored in the Duchy, the Duke consedering it a criticism of the future-Duchess Maria Borgia, .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.A;A shame our Duke dislikes good theatre...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.T;The Republican Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.D;Following a commission and gifts from all parts of the Republic, a new monument was unveiled in Florence. A statue was erected in honor of the Republican heroes Goffredo Baccarani and his wife Mariana Angeliotti. Baccarani secured the existence of the Republic in its first years and nearly managed to unify Northern Italy until he was shot in the leg and forced to retreat from the battlefields. His wife ruled the Republic in his absence through a network of yesmen allowing her to overcome the fact that women were not allowed to exercize charges. Even after the Moderate takeover of the Republic, Mariana continued to head the popular movements until she was shot by a priest in 1821. An immense crowd gathered to pay their respects to the Father and especially the Mother of the Republic, who now watch over the city from the hill of the Oltrarno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.A;Statues to honor Republicans not Tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.T;The Crown of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.D;The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja, which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples, his brother and heir Ferran VI, died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV, Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive, for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them, Milan may especially prove troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.T;The escape of Maria Borja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.D;Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan, Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples. While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy, she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions, the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. In the night of the 25th February 1837, she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria, heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.A;Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.T;Maria Borgia, future duchess of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.D;Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I, the prince of Legnano, in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes, with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri. Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General, Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke, Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon, as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo, the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily, so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.A;Maria will become Queen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.T;The House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.D;The house of Savoy is one of the mightiest houses of Italy. Ever since the XVIIth century, our power has grown in Italy proper while our Transalpine possessions becoming more of an afterthought. The conquest of Monferrato and Novara from the Duchy of Milan in the late XVIIIth century saw us put firmly in the Anglois sphere. To many in Turin it appears that we could leverage our Western possessions against military help to form a united Italy. At least, we will not bow down so easily to other would-be unifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.A;FERT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.T;Our chance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.D;The call to unity from Maria Borgia and the current war against Aragon appear to many officials as the perfect opportunity for our state to gain ascendency. But at the same time, this would alienate our friends in Paris which are still interested in our Savoyard possessions and we would be alone in this war. Let us backstab our rivals in Milan and become the true unifiers of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.A;To Milan and more !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.B;Now is not the right time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.T;Ending the Revolutionary threat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.D;The Etrurian republic which has been the greatest threat to stability and tradition in Italy in the recent past is now at war with the Aragonese Crown. We can’t let either win : Etruria securing its independence would inspire revolutionaries everywhere in Italy while Aragon restoring order would just hamper our claims to the old Kingdom of Italy. We must thus cross the border and attack the so called ‘heart of the Revolution’ and bring glory and unity to the peninsula. But at the same time, this would alienate us our friends in Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.A;We will end the ‘Republic’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.B;Let them fight, we can pick up the scraps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.T;The isolation of Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.D;Turin has profited from the current state of war between us and Central Italy to backstab our enemies and proclaim that they are the only worthy unifier of Italy. While it will make our war easier, we must profit from the opportunity to bring Piedmont under our domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.A;The house of Savoy must end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.B;We must focus on our current war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.T;Foreign Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.D;$COUNTRY$ faces war as foreigners have crossed our borders and threaten to topple us. This has created a large surge of patriotism so our lands do not fall to foreign domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR5.A;For Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.T;The fate of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.D;With our influence secured in Savoy, our state can easily obtain their western territories on our side of the Alps in exchange for support in creating an Italian state. At the same time, some jingoists in our state recall that we could take opportunity of their relative weakness to crush the Savoyard state and annex it in its entirety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.A;Savoy is enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR6.B;We will cross the Alps as conquerors !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR7.B;Turin and Genoa are rightfully ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.T;The threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.D;With the house of Savoy under threat from invaders from beyond the Alps, the political climate in the Italian confederation has drastically changed. With their rivals from Turin not able to deny their legitimacy and the threat caused by the invasion, the Italian confederation has declared itself the rightful Italian state and has received the support of most of the Italian patriots in doing so. The squabbles between the various members have also been put aside, creating a federal government with far more prerogatives than the old Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.A;Avanti Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$’s proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.D;$ FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials have proposed us their help in the unification of Italy under our state in exchange for the promise of our Savoyard possessions. It is true that our state was created in the Alpine valleys and that the royal house is known as the house of Savoy. But these are rural and enclaved lands, and not many want to keep them when we can easily trade them for the whole peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.A;If they honor the deal, we will give them Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.B;We can’t renounce the lands of our ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ accepted !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted to let go of the Alps in exchange for our military aid against the Italian confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR10.A;A good trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.D;Following agreements between the house of Savoy and $FROMCOUNTRY$, the government of $COUNTRY$ has declared war on the weak Italian confederation, proclaiming that Italy needs a strong and united government rather than the mess that the Compromesso created. It is a war opposing Italian against Italian, with the support of foreigners, and whatever the end, it will change Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.A;Let us hope for the better…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.T;A Geographical Construct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.D;Italy has been ‘united’ by $FROMCOUNTRY$. A weak puppet state only controlling Northern Italy, not even Rome, this new state has already been heavily criticized by the Italian patriots who see it only as the result of another foreign imperialist. While it appeared to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government as the best option to stabilize Italy, this may lead to a renewed era of instability from the various groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.A;At least there is an Italy I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.T;Il Compromesso;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.D;The Italian Confederation is a loose compromise between the various powers of Central Italy. It satisfies no one, and few people consider it the rightful Italian state. Unless the state can assert itself in the coming years, it may easily fall to infighting and instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.A;We will unite Italy nonetheless !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful. Nonetheless, our old rival in Turin, propped up by foreign powers, has apparently decided to approach the Confederation for a proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.A;It is strange …;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful. Many officials demand a new general reunion of our members to discuss the state of the Confederation and its future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR15.A;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.T;Approaching the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.D;The Confederation while weak is still the main contender to the unification of Italy. With no strong foreign support for our cause, we have stood as rivals for decades without any particular change to the global situation. With critics accumulating of the Confederation, it seems to many officials that it would be the right time to join it, and use our influence and might to appoint our government and unite Italy. But at the same time, it is a risky move, and we could let the Confederation fail and dissolve on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.A;Integrate the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.B;Integrate the Confederation (player only);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR16.C;Better to let it fall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.T;The new Savoyard government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.D;The house of Savoy had bided its time but they have successfully managed to take control of the Confederation by appointing their chosen government with the help of many Italian nationalists and various opponents inside the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.A;What does this entail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.T;The Council of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.D;The various officials of the Italian states who are members of the Confederation have gathered in $THISCAPITAL$ to discuss the future of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.A;The dice is cast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.T;A Stable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.D;While many thought that the Confederation was living its last hours, temperance has prevailed in the Council, as all its members recognized that they were better in this Confederation than independent and only to be prey to the Aragonese and Piedmontese. Thus endures the Confederation, and maybe one day, it will be the legitimate Italian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.A;Long live the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.T;Collapse of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.D;The compromise that created the Italian confederation has failed to endure. The various members of this polity decided to dissolve the state and go their separate ways following decades of political inertia and divisions. Italy becomes fractured again, and no one knows who will profit from this return to the old times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.A;Damn the divisions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.T;The Unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.D;Following the appointment of the Piedmontese grand-duke as head of the Confederation, many feared that the Aragonese would try to disrupt the new power in the North. But unable to intervene, this has left the Savoyards to cement their rule of the Confederation and finally proclaim a united Italian Kingdom under their helm. Now Italy exists, and not just as a weak state unable to resolve disputes between the various interests groups that composed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.A;Avanti Italia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.T;Savoyard Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.D;A weak Italian Confederation served our interests well since it allowed us to play the various members of this state one against another. But the pesky Savoyards have appointed their own government following the recent political instability in the Confederation, and if we don’t act soon they could easily proclaim a united Italy. Our best chance is to secure Rome and the Pope swiftly and deal with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.A;Rome must be protected !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.B;We are not strong enough to face the Savoyards…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.T;The Italian Liberation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.D;Aragonese troops walked into Rome following the announcement of the reorganization of the Confederation under the house of Savoy. This is an outrage to all Italian patriots and it has strengthened our rule. But we must march south unless we want Italy to still be disunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.A;To Rome !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.B;The Confederation is fine without the South…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.T;Victory of the House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.D;The mobilized forces of the reorganized Italian confederation have liberated Rome from Aragonese occupation. Following this tremendous success, the Grand-Duke of Piedmont was officially crowned King of Italy and abolished the former Confederation. A new power has emerged on the European scene, and soon Italy will surely be completely independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.A;FERT !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.T;Victory of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.D;The Italian Confederation could not vanquish our forces in Rome, leaving us in control of the old city, the Pope and crushing any hope the Savoyards entertained about using the Confederation as a tool for their ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.A;Our ambitions are intact !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.T;Intervention in Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.D;The Papal states have been recreated only to be annexed by us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR26.A;A good conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.D;Backed by foreign interests, Piedmont has declared war on the Italian Confederation. Should they win, they will not stop at just Northern Italy, already planning for the conquest of our southern holdings. Now is the time for action and war against the Confederation to carve the North before Savoyards take it. Although that also means that we could end up facing the Great Power that protects and helps them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR31.D;Taking advantage of our disorder following our unification of the Italian peninsula, an envoy from Burgundy has come to press their claims on the region of Savoy. While the region has been under Italian rule for centuries the population itself is of mixed stock, with the francophone Romand comprising a slight majority. Based on this majority, the Burgundians seem insistent on claiming the territory, with the Burgundian envoy hinting at war were we to refuse their claims. As Savoy has been a part of an Italian state for centuries, nationalists have called upon us to defend the territory against Burgundian aggression. On the other hand, the Romand majority that inhabits Savoy is culturally much closer to the Burgundians than the Italians, and to reject their demands would mean perpetual enmity between ourselves and the Burgundians. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the Crimeans also impose an difficult obstacle on our policymakers: access to the Black Sea.

From the Gulf of Finland to the gulf of Riga, we may now enjoy the prosperity of Baltic trade. But our victories don’t end there, with Baltic trade comes access to the West, as the only thing that separates our state from the ones of Central and Western Europe’s is a short boat trip.

Kazan’s presence has slowly shrunk over the years as Russia has coalesced into a powerful nation, and now poses no threat to our security. But Russian interests in the region demand action, Kazan is still in our way eastwards, and its rivers will prove useful for our economy. Now that Kazan has been declawed, we may be able to force it into our empire diplomatically, turning it into a mere protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

integrate_bashkir_desc;Bashkir lays in the middle of the Ural Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Aral Sea. A symbolic gateway eastwards, wherefrom we may not only ride eastwards, but also southwards to the lands of Persia and India. Like the rest of the petty khanates, economic and military pressure might prove to be an easier solution to direct military action, for we have gone a long way since the Russian nation has exploded outwards from its Slavic heartlands.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many call for the old city of Saraj to be planned as the new capital as we build a canal between the Don and the Volga rivers.

CRUS1.T;The new Troubles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.D;The idea of a united Russia was born under the leadership of the Princes of Moscow in the XIVth and XVth century, but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia. Yaroslav, Moscow and Ryazan all had their hour of glory but Tatar attacks, Polish and Scandinavian support for their enemies and pure incompetence led to an ever changing balance of power between the three principalities. Konstantin XI Belsky of Yaroslavl hopes to unify the Russians under his absolute rule to modernize the country. The Repnins of Ryazan must face a powerful boyar assembly who thrives on serfdom. Meanwhile, Nizhny Novgorod never had the power of the other contestants, though its links to the East and the confusing situation surrounding her Prince Alexey II may lead to an opportunity to get power. The status quo holds because of the Scandinavian and Polish networks in the area but with Poland and Scandinavia growing weaker it will soon break.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS2.T;The Principality of Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.D;In 1836, the Lyapunov principality of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, the defection of a Smolensk noble confederation in Vyazma to Moscow, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europe’s sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians. In the meantime his sister Anna reigns in Nizhny Novgorod alongside her husband Alexey II. But troubles are brewing in all of Russia as the Republic of Novgorod crumbles under its contradictions while the various princes hope to vanquish us to reunify what Ivan III nearly achieved in the XVth century./nWarning: Moscow has the hardest time forming Russia since it only has access to the Form Russia decision since it is the status quo candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.T;The Principality of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.D;The Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between Russian states and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Yaroslavl-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere of influence and in the last 40 years the title of Prince of Smolensk has been part of the long list of honorifics of the Polish king. The princedom is de facto ruled by a Governor, currently General Aleksander Kilinski, who has to wrestle authority with the local Duma controlled by boyar families and the archeparch. Smolensk has agitated for years against Poland, and the recent loss of its eastern territories to Moscow has cemented the idea among the population and the elites that the Polish yoke will have to be thrown out and Smolesnk must regain its independence. Smolensk is the Russian state that has been the most influenced by the West with works of the Enlightenment translated and discussed in the salons of the capital: should it seize the occasion and unite Russia, it will surely be a new era for Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.T;Polonizacja;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.D;The annexation of Smolensk by the Commonwealth led to the extension of Western habits in the Princedom. Smolensk is thus home to the first Russian-language University and has become one of the liveliest cultural centres of Eastern Europe, especially for literature and theatrical drama. In the halls of the university, students gather in various meetings and recent inquiries have shown the development of nationalist speeches in its halls. Governor Aleksander Kilinski decided to act by passing a law to bring the Smolensk university to the same standard as the rest of the Rzeczpospolita, namely making the usage of Polish language mandatory while restricting access to the Jewish and non-Uniate students. Of course it meant receiving the approval of the Duma which had vetoed most of his decisions in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.A;Smolensk will be taught Polish!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.B;The law is vetoed in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.T;University protests;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.D;The Polish debate in the Duma was met with hostility by the student leaders and some professors who criticized both the Polonization policy of the Governor acting on the orders of Warsaw and the aristocratic Duma that clung to its privilege. Students poured into the streets brandishing a banner of gold, blue, and white that has become in the previous years a pan-Russian nationalist symbol. The demonstration nearly ended in a riot before the Smolenskian guards of Kilinski dispersed the students without shedding any blood. The day after, a new journal was born, 'Svoboda i Narodnost' (Freedom and Nation) whose director Michel Shafirov had become a public figure following a speech in the demonstration. It has become evident to many Polish administrators that Smolensk could erupt into revolt in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.A;Damn students!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.T;The Smolensk Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.D;Unrest had grown in the whole principality for months, with the newspaper 'Freedom and Nation' stirring up the various causes of discontent against Warsaw. Following the news of the death of the King of the Commonwealth, the various nationalist groups clamored for an end to Polish rule in Smolensk and demonstrations erupted in the capital. With students joined by the members of all classes of the city, Governor Kilinski was soon abandoned by his troops and forced to flee to Kaunas. The Duma was soon convened by the archeparch and the nobles were quick to use the events to proclaim Smolenskian independence. However the crowd led by Shafirov, soon entered the Duma demanding the abolition of serfdom. With the troops rallied to the insurgents, the archeparch soon proclaimed its end and called for the Duma to reconvene two weeks later to decide the future of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.A;The revolution has freed the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.T;Ending the Regency.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.D;As the archeparch had proclaimed, the Duma reconvened to decide who shall rule the Principality. Adding to the traditional seats held by the boyars and the clergy, the cities had sent representatives for the first time in its history. In this new assembly the archeparch proposed for prince, the experienced Vasily Kropotkin, a descendant of the Rurikids. Meanwhile the aristocrats attempted to place one of their own, Stanislav Bagushevic, wary of the power of a prince supported by the archeparch. With the nobility split, it was to the new deputies to decide. Shafirov who represented Smolensk meanwhile advocated for the end of the princedom: Smolensk should be a confederation under the symbolic protection of the archeparch like in Kiev and most of all grant voting rights to all its population. He argued that liberating the serfs was meaningless without their participation in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS8.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.D;Kilinski had been forced to flee, but he did not intend to let the revolutionaries win. Without any support of the Sejm in Warsaw he was forced to rely on the political networks and relations he had created while in office. He gained support in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the plans for Russian national unification and had stronger ties with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy would have succeeded if he had not been discovered crossing the border, and forced to flee back to Warsaw. Eventually the Smolenskian forces were able to disperse the Litvins in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS9.A;Will we be free of this man?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.D;Kilinski may have failed to take control of Smolensk but he soon find enough supporters in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the promises of war made by the new government, and had stronger ties with the Commonwealth than with Russia. He has now proclaimed the secession of the southern provinces who hoist the Pahonia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.A;Smolensk is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.T;The Vyazma Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.D;A decade ago the boyars of our eastern provinces have left the principality, choosing the prince of Moscow as their new liege due to heavy taxation imposed by Kilinski. This was a blow to the already waning influence of the Commonwealth which could not lift a finger to avoid it, mostly because they had allied with Moscow against Scandinavia and Yaroslavl. With our independence secured many think it is time to reclaim our lost lands, secure the capital, and prepare ourselves for the fight to come. But many nobles are angered by the end of serfdom in Smolensk. These nobles refuse to aid in preparations for war, while the Duma is increasingly divided on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.A;War will come anyway, we must strike first!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.B;War is vetoed in the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.T;The Vozhd;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.D;The veto of war preparatives has paralysed the Duma, and the aristocracy clashed with the nationalists and liberals. Eventually the situation deteriorated to the point that a young officer, Commander Mikhail Tomylovic, left his barrack with his regiment and stormed the Duma. Unknown before, this officer that has risen from the ranks and whose parents were freed serfs, is now in charge of the destiny of the state. Tomylovic has proclaimed himself 'Vozhd' (the Leader of the People), has abolished the Duma, and finally arrested several boyars of high rank while forcing the archeparch to resign from his leadership role. Now the preparations begin for the oncoming war, for the Vozhd will not let Moscow bring shame to Smolesnk anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.A;A new leader for Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.T;The Smolensk embassy;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.D;Eventually the demands of the Smolenskian state were dispatched to the prince of Moscow: he was to cede back the unlawful territories he had usurped in the past decade or face war from Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.A;It is merely for diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.T;Smolenskian declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.D;We had extended our western border in 1829 following the secession of a league of nobles angered by taxation from the Polish administration of Smolensk. But now declaring independence, Smolensk comes after us in an attempt to reclaim these lands. Warsaw had not interved when Smolensk had declared its revolution, and they will not intervene now for such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.A;We can defeat Smolensk easily!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.T;The declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.D;It is time to retake back our lands from Moscow and free our brothers who still suffer under serfdom!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.A;Vyazma shall be ours again!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.T;Return of the Vyazman Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.D;Moscow has been crushed by our modern forces and we have retaken our lands in the east. It is a great victory for $COUNTRY$ and the first actions we have undertaken is to put to trial the boyars who seceded in 1829 while freeing the serfs from these provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.A;Smolensk is ascendant!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.D;Just as we have delivered a blow to our enemies in the west, we’ve also repelled our enemies in the east. The conniving general Alexander Kilinski has attempted to overthrow our government and the duma in order to drag Smolensk back into polish servitude. The coup naturally found no support from the people of Smolensk, and the army has quickly captured and detained the general and his litvin collaborators from Polotsk. Kilinski has already been executed for his crimes, and his supporters who did not flee to Poland wait in our prisons, and will surely meet a similar fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.A;The integrity of Smolensk has triumphed!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.D;A peculiar figure has briefly reemerged in Smolensk: the traitor Kilinski. He was surrounded by Litvins, who wished to return Smolensk to the authority of Warsaw. Kilinski and his supporters against leader Tomylovic and Smolensk were gunned down by our militia as they attempted to make their way through our great city. However, the leader was greatly agitated by this coup, and perceived the litvins in the west as perpetrators, and betrayers of the russian people. The leader of the people, Mikhail Tomylovic, has unleashed the army of Smolensk on the countryside, massacring litvins who are believed to be conspirators./n/nSmolensk is bloody and quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.A;Smolensk remains unshakeable!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.T;:Insurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.D;Our forces, bloodied and beaten by the muscovite army, have been taken by surprise. General Kilinski has marched on Smolensk with the support of dissatisfied litvins in order to restore the authority of the polish crown! Our brave men have managed to repel the traitor, but were unable to capture or kill him. Kilinski has now fled to Polotsk, and began preparations for an active insurrection against the princedom. The details regarding his efforts are muddy, and we are not sure to what degree the former-governor has managed to whip up support among the litvins. Regardless of that, our army is preparing for an armed confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.A;Smolensk will NOT be torn to pieces!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.T;A free Polotsk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.D;The prince of Smolensk has finally been driven out of Polotsk, and we have achieved freedom from the east. The militiamen of Polotsk roam its streets, safe and unmolested. Now that the future of Polotsk lays within our hands and not those of the Russian, we may decide our fate: we could attempt to join our kin in the grand duchy of Lithuania, or remain a sovereign and independent state.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.A;Let us unite with our people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.B;Polotsk will remain free and strong!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.T;Polotsk secedes from Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.D;To our surprise, the fledgling Polotsk insurgency has driven out the princely forces of Smolensk. The Polotsk insurgents first took arms to bring the whole of Smolensk back to our hands, but after failing their objective, they resorted to break free from the principality altogether. Now the small state has petitioned us for annexation into the grand duchy of Lithuania. Naturally, we see no problem with such an arrangement, but the Sejm does. The Sejm has shot down Polotsk's proposal with a veto, leaving our relationship in an awkward and uncertain state. The best we could do is wait for a better time.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.A;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.T;The Sejm refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.D;The people of Polotsk are in shock as news from Warsaw has arrived: the polish Sejm has refused to admit our ascension into the grand duchy of Lithuania! Our government is uncertain about how to proceed, as we have fought tooth and nail against Smolensk for the unity of our people. The best we can hope for is a more favorable situation in Warsaw...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.A;How could they do such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.T;A Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.D;When Stanislaw Habsburg was convicted as a traitor by the Sejm, he pondered his options. Austria may have been the seat of his house but the Polish branch had cut ties with Wien following the German wars and the rift had never been healed. Moreover it meant becoming a pawn in Bohemian hands, something Stanislaw could not accept. Thus he went to Moscow, joining his sister Maria, wed decades before to the prince Peter III Lyapunov. Over the years Stanislaw had proved himself a strong strategist, at least on paper, and a commander his men respected and looked up to. Now settled in the Kremlin, he has asked for a commandment to at least 'be useful' in his exile. Approved by the Prince, this move has been criticised by some members of the pro-Polish faction who fear that the Commonwealth may look towards Moscow once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.A;The Commonwealth is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.D;The succession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslavl. Having produced no offspring despite his decade of marriage, both hope to inherit the principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for figurative and performing arts. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that the Prince is a homosexual and thus unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have wept at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' and decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife and counts Balakhnin and Varankin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.A;A strange affair...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.D;The succession of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is both the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite having been married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver hope to inherit the Principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for theater and ballets. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that a Prince enjoying acting on stage among other 'foreign vices' is unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have been so angered at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' that he decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife Anna as the counts Kondraty Balakhnin and Grigory Varankin, both men known for their respective ties to Tver and Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.A;Retiring alone in his dacha will not give him an offspring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.T;A day in the countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.D;Alexey II has been enjoying his sojourn at his hunting dacha, which was embellished by his father in order to make it as furnished as the palace in the city. Alexey has enlarged the estate, reserving an entire aisle for his theatrical endeavours. When Anna Lyapunova, his wife, came to the residency with General Temey Talantsev escorting her, the Prince was playing the main role of Orpheus, a melodrama by the Bohemian playwright, Ludwid Schubert. Following the ending of the play, the prince retired to his private quarter with his wife. No one knew what has occured during their exchange but the princess has decided to reside for an indefinite time in the dacha with her husband, leaving the affairs of state to the various factions of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.A;What is the meaning of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.T;An heir for Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, Prince Alexey has emerged to announce that his wife is pregnant with an heir. 2 years earlier, in order to relieve his melancholy caused by the attacks of politicians and the pressures of his natural family and in-law-family, Alexey had delegated all political affairs to Anna Lyapunova, with whom he had an undeniable close and affectionate relationship. This announcement at the end of a routine long stay of the princess at the dacha has shocked the Russian courts, many speculating that the presumptive heir would actually be a legitimised child of the Princess and her latest publicly known paramour. Yet after a slightly premature childbirth, healthy Mikhail Belsky was declared the natural son of the prince and princess and sole legitimate heir to Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.A;Long live Mikhail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.T;Family news;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the cousin of our prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to Nizhny Novgorod to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we would have the right to denounce the child as illegitimate to claim the principality that was ours but a few decades ago. But should Moscow support the princess and recognize her offspring as legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.A;Congratulate Alexey for the enlargement of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.B;Mikhail is a bastard and Anna a woman of little virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.T;Family news;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the brother-in-law of our Prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod, has emerged back in his capital to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. The Moscow court was always wary of Anna who always appeared ambitious and full of vices for the devout circles in court. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we could denounce the conduct of Anna Lyapunova. But should Yaroslavl support the princess and recognize her offspring legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the ourt of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.A;Congratulate Anna for her child!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.B;Anna has dishonored the Lyapunov family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.T;Denunciation  of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.D;The prince of Moscow has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, denouncing the shameful conduct of the princess, and accusing her of using another man to cover for the 'foreign vices' of her husband. Count Kondraty Balakhnin, the leader of the pro-Yaroslavl faction in the court has joined the prince in the palace to suggest to him the dissolution of the Duma and to purge the Muscovite plotters that held power in it, with the support of Yaroslavl of course. Meanwhile the princess warned him of the influence of the Yaroslavl faction that could use the purge of the Duma to ensure their own power in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.A;Alexey trusts the Count.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.B;Alexey follows the advice of his wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.T;A letter to Yaroslavl;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.D;The plots of the Yaroslavl faction have born fruit. Following the recent events at the Court and in the Duma, Count Balakhnin has secured power and put the princely family under surveillance in their palace to avoid the various assassination plots that had sprung in the previous weeks. Exchanges of letters between Nizhny Novgorod and the court of Yaroslav are seen daily as the Count prepares for the reunification of the Belsky familial lands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.A;One Belsky replaced with another;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.T;A letter from Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.D;Our man in Nizhny Novgorod, the Count Balakhnin has taken power following the events that saw the discussion of the legitimacy of the heir of the principality by our rivals in Moscow. Nizhny Novgorod is now our puppet and Balakhnin assures us that the current situation will soon 'be resolved' as the melancholy of the Prince is becoming more evident each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.A;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.T;The end of the Principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.D;Events unfolded quickly in the principality. Alexey was found dead, hanging in his residence. The prince always had depressive excesses and the news of his suicide did not surprise any at the court. His death was masked as a 'bad fall' to not tarnish his memory but as soon as he was buried Balakhnin moved. Disregarding heir Mikhail as an infant, and the Duma still dissolved, he convened an assembly of firendly boyars and together offered the crown to the senior Belsky branch in Yaroslavl. Meanwhile the dowager princess was abducted by remnants of the Moscow faction, and sent her to her brother who made her abdicate her claims to the principality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.T;Anna's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.D;On the advice of his wife, Alexey asked the Duma to confirm Mikhail as heir of the principality but faced opposition from the boyars who refused to acknowledge his successor given Muscovite accusations. His attempt to dissolve the Duma and enforce his succession by decree failed due to the betrayal of military figures close to the pro-Moscow circle including Grigory Varankin, a former paramour of his wife. In the chaos that followed, the three leaders of the boyar cliques in Nizhny Novgorod all had their chance at power. Balakhnin proposed to reconvene the Duma while purging the Muscovite with the help of Yaroslavl, Grigory Varankin's soldiers were ready to take power and reclaim the lands of Ivanovo from Yaroslavl with Muscovian help while Anna Lyapunova urged the General Temey Talantsev secure the regency for her son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS34.T;Varankin secures power Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and assumed power in Nizhny Novgorod. The general has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from yaroslavl with our support. Of course, in actuality he has ceded the principality to us. Yaroslavl is outraged by the coup, decrying the actions of Varankin as illegitimate and unlawful, and vowing to bring Nizhny Novgorod down by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.A;Time to march north!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.T;Varankin seizes power in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and stole Nizhny Novgorod away to the muscovites. Varankin has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from us with support from Moscow. Varankin has effectively ceded the authority of Nizhny Novgorod to Moscow, and his aggressive posturing is tantamount to a declaration of war! How should we respond to this affront?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.A;We will restore our rule over Nizhny Novgorod once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.B;Can we really afford an armed confrontation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.T;Nizhny Novgorod asks for help;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.D;Temey Talantsev is a Nizhegorodian general of Mari-Chuvash origins, who has managed to become the regent during the chaos that ensued after Nizhny Novgorod’s succession crisis. Now both Moscow and yaroslavl are ready to pounce on the principality. Furthermore, Nizhny Novgorod has petitioned us for help against both of their neighbours./n/n This venture could prove to be very dangerous for Kazan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.A;We embrace Nizhny Novgorod’s call to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.B;Are they out of their minds?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.T;Regent Talantsev calls for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.D;Regent Talantsev has asserted Nizhny Novgorod’s by executing sympathetic agents of Moscow and Yaroslavl that have operated in the army and the Duma. Now, as relations between us, Moscow, and yaroslavl are in shambles, the regnet wishes to take the fight to yaroslavl and Moscow as a way to put their political meddling to an end. Most of our government fears this proposition and believes this idea to hasten the demise of the principality, but the regent remains steadfast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.A;We will bring the schemers to their knees!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.B;We must back away from this insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.T;Pouncing on Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.D;The Muscovite scheme has blown up in their face. Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow and yaroslavl are now locked in a war together, and letting Moscow get away with their schemes is unacceptable. Our government has decided to take advantage of Moscow’s folly and strike while the iron is hot. We will launch an attack on the principality of Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.A;Moscow will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.T;Denunciation of the the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.D;The Prince of Yaroslavl has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, accusing the new heir of being a bastard, and citing adultery on the part of princess Anna Lyapunova as the reason. As a response to this outcry, the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma began to accuse the princess of despotism and attempted to replace her with Count Balakhnin as the regent of Nizhny Novgorod. Fortunately, the army has come to the princess’ aid and refused to make any moves against her. The situation does not remain under control for long, a few months later Prince Alexy suddenly collapses during dinner with Anna and his entourage, he spends the next days under intense medical care before finally dying. Nizhny Novgorod swirls up in chaos as the bickering factions of the Duma begin to accuse one another of assassinating the prince. Some accuse the princess, while some accuse the Yaroslavl faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.A;Grigory Varankin arrests the princess! (Will result in Nizhny Novgorod’s annexation);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.B;The army supports the princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.T;Moscow occupies Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.D;General Varankin has decided to exploit the situation in Moscow’s favor. Under the cover of night the general, surrounded by other Moscow loyalists, has entered the residence of the princess and arrested both her and the heir Mikhail. The group has quickly whisked the two away to Moscow. The prince of Moscow has acted quickly and advanced into Nizhny Novgorod unopposed. The end of a sovereign Nizhny Novgorod is here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.A;Moscow ascendent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.D;Our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexy’s death. Princess Anna Lyapunov and her son were arrested and brought to Moscow, and our armies have marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasn’t for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be “its lawful and sovereign land”, and it’s apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.T;Princess Anna confirmed as regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.D;With the backing of the army, Princess Annah Lyapunova has managed to crush and purge the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma. Now with a compliant Duma, the princess has managed to get the Duma to officially confirm her as the Princess-Regent of Nizhny Novgorod.Wasting no time, the princess-regent has appointed the half-Tatar General Talantsev as her prime minister, together the two began to introduce reforms to centralize the state, keep the boyars in line, and rein in the middle class. The princess-regent has also taken an aggressive stance on Yaroslavl and the lands of Ivanovo, promising to bring this lawful part of Nizhny Novgorod into the fold. On the other hand, Moscow and Yaroslavl are not impressed with our new government and the harsh treatment of the boyars who holds loyalties to their principalities, and the already shaken relations between our nations have all but disintegrated, as the two hostile princes will surely take on a violent approach to deal with our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.A;Let them come! The princess-regent and Nizhny Novgorod are ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.T;Moscow and Yaroslavl recognize our heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.D;To our surprise, both the princes of Yaroslavl and Moscow have recognized Mikhail Belsky as the new heir to Nizhny Novgorod. We hope that today might mark the beginning of a more friendly relationship between our domains. In any case, it seems that for now the position of our heir is secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.A;God save Mikhail Belsky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.T;General Grigory Varankin dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.D;The Moscow aligned General Grigory Varankin has recently died under suspicious circumstances. The general’s corpse was discovered frozen in the Oka river during the early hours of the morning. In the following days the Duma became a battleground as Yaroslavl-friendly members of the Duma began to accuse Princess Anna of assassinating General Varankin with the help of her lover General Talantsev. The muscovite faction of the Duma is especially harsh on Talantsev, attacking and emphasizing his Tatar heritage./n/nSensing the change in course, Talantsev flees to Kazan while Anna’s allies slowly back away from the scene. In a last bid to save their princely power, Anna implores Prince Alexy to take action against the chaos and intrigue of the Duma. The prince won’t budge. Coherency is all but lost in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.A;Can’t anything work out here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.T;Prince Alexy abdicates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.D;The Green Prince, sensing that the end is near, has officially announced his abdication, the prince is preparing to depart to a monastery to live out the rest of his life. But in a last ditch effort to salvage his legacy, the prince has petitioned the Duma to officially pronounce Anna Lyapunova as princess-regent. Princess Anna, unfortunately, has lost all of her allies, as both the Moscow and Yaroslavl factions of the Duma have torn her and each other apart. There are talks of a partition between Yaroslavl and Moscow, and even downright war. Stories from the east have also begun to surface, they speak of a disgraced tatar general gathering supporters for a final bid for power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS46.D;As Prince Alexy of Nizhny Novgorod has finally abdicated from his throne, the nizhgorodian Duma has been thrown into chaos. However our sympathizers in the Duma have managed to secure a strong enough of a foothold to allow us to march unopposed into the city!/n/nUnfortunately, we now face opposition from Moscow, who view the restoration of our rule as unlawful and illegitimate. The muscovites are allegedly already preparing for an armed conflict as their forces muster at our borders...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS47.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.D;Despite the death of our main representative in Nizhny Novgorod, General Grigory Varankin, our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexy’s abdication. His wife, Princess Anna, was powerless to control the army, and our forces marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasn’t for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be “its lawful and sovereign land”, and it’s apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.T;Our heir remains unrecognized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.D;The princes of Moscow and Yaroslavl have rejected the legitimacy of our heir, Mikhail Belsky! They claim that Alexy’s effeminate nature and dubious sexuality muddies the circumstances of his son’s birth and throws the whole ordeal into question. Alexy’s reaction is even more surprising, the Green Prince has come out of isolation and began to assert himself (against the wishes of his aides) as the ruler of the principality. Anna Lyapunov has not taken this encroachment kindly. The princess’ views towards a modernist government and military strongly contrasts against her husband’s humanist and democratic views, and his hatred of secret police and the death penalty. This conflict between the princely consorts has created a divide in the government and Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, and now two factions, a pro-Alexy and pro-Anna have been formed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.A;A shocking turn of events!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.T;General Talantsev is killed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.D;Controversy rocks Nizhny Novgorod as the death of General Talantsev, one of Princess Anna’s closest allies, is made public. The general has been killed while apparently plotting the assassination of Prince Alexy and the burning of his dacha to make it look like an accident! His death by his former co-conspirator is now the topic of a heated discussion, some believe Princess Anna to be behind Talantsev’s plot, but others claim that the entire event was coaxed by the Green Prince to kill one of his wife’s allies. The Duma is currently at a crossroad, there’s great confusion regarding who’s allied to whom, and the military is beginning to grow very distrustful towards the Duma and the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.A;Prince Alexy arrests Anna and restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.B;The army remains loyal to Princess Anna!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.T;Nizhny Novgorod arrests Princess Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.D;Upon the rejection of our recognition of their heir, the prince and princess of Nizhny Novgorod have begun to bicker among themselves. And now after an attempt on his feeble life, Prince Alexy has arrested his own wife Anna Lyapunov with the help of that scoundrel General Varankin! Our own royalty now rots in a Nizhgorodian prison. Our aides now encourage us to send an offer to Prince Alexy: to recognise his heir in favor of the freedom of the member of our princely family./n/nsome see this as a show of weakness, but most believe that Yaroslavl would make a move on the Nizhgorodians if we’d let the situation deteriorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.A;Send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.B;Perhaps we should not intervene...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.T;Moscow offers recognition for the release of the princess;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.D;Prince Alexy has wrestled control over the principality and arrested Princess Anna with the help of the ruthless General Varankin. Together the two have dissolved the Duma and proclaimed the autocracy of Alexey Belsky, while Varankin was appointed as the “Plenipotentiary Minister”. While Alexy has managed to push some serf reforms, his minister has held most of the power in Nizhny Novgorod. This struggle has been interrupted by Moscow, who offered Alexy recognition of his rule as the prince of Nizhny Novgorod for the release of Princess Anna Lyapunov, a member of Moscow’s princely family./nPrince Alexy is naturally ecstatic about the chance to ensure his rule and the independence of his state. Varankin on the other hand does not trust Moscow, and a vicious struggle between the two has begun behind the scenes...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.A;Can’t we just reach an agreement?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.T;Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.D;Prince Alexy and Minister Varankin’s cooperation has reached its end point. Today the prince is ordering the army to detain and remove minister Varankin from his post, fearing that Varankin would do to him as he has done to the princess over their dispute regarding Moscow’s offer./n/nAt the same time however, the minister has started to march through the streets of Nizhny Novgorod, flanked by a mounted cavalry company friendly to him. The band is currently marching towards the prince’s residence while civilians flee the scene. Varankin is steadfast in his distrust of Moscow, and believes that removing Alexy before he agrees to Moscow’s ultimatum is the only way to preserve the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.A;Varankin enters the compound and guns Alexy down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.B;Alexy intercepts Varankin and executes him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.T;The prince of Nizhny Novgorod dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.D;A battle has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has been gunned down and dismembered by his own minister, General Grigory Varankin. Due to our refusal to recognise the dead prince’s son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we officially view the throne of the principality as vacant. We may have the opportunity to press forwards and claim the principality as our own! However, we should keep in mind that Moscow will not take this move lightly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.A;Claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.B;Perhaps we shouldn’t encourage a Muscovite retaliation...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.T;Moscow prepares to move on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.D;An insurgency has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has won out against his own minister, General Grigory Varankin, who attempted to rebel out of disagreements regarding negotiations with Moscow. But the prince’s negotiations with the traitorous Muscovite have been for nothing, as news from Moscow hint that its prince is preparing to betray Nizhny Novgorod and make war on it! Some of our advisors have suggested offering prince Alexy our “protection” against Moscow in favor of vassalage. But due to our refusal to recognise the dead prince’s son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we may be able to declare Alexey as unfit to rule and press our own claim on the throne. In that case, we should expect Muscovite resistance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.A;Send Alexey an offer of friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.B;We’ll strike now! Down with Nizhny Novgorod, and down with Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.T;Moscow betrays the agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.D;To the shock of the Green Prince, the Muscovites did not honor their agreement. Our claim to the throne remains snubbed, and the principality has begun to mass its armies in preparation for war! But perhaps we have a chance to survive this catastrophe. Yaroslavl has approached Prince Alexy with an offer, “Commit your principality to a closer bond with ours, and we’ll help you.” The court understands the meaning of this offer, and most of Alexey’s aides push the prince to accept as a last ditch effort to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.A;We’ll bend the knee...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.B;After I’m through with Moscow, YOU are next Yaroslavl!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.T;Nizhny Novgorod returns Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.D;The Nizhgorodians have buckled under our pressure and released Anna Lyapunov to us! Now we have a magnificent opportunity to press our claim on the whole of Nizhny Novgorod! Without Princess Anna at the helm, we may revoke our recognition of Alexey’s child and declare him unfit to rule, leaving us with a casus belli to take the principality to ourselves! Of course this will provoke Yaroslavl to action, but how could we pass on this opportunity?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.A;To Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.B;We can’t break our promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.T;Princess Anna restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.D;Despite Prince Alexy’s position as the de jure authority in the principality, Anna Lyapunov has managed to make powerful allies among the army and the boyars. Following the consorts' struggle for power, the princess has managed not only to sideline the Green Prince, but also to imprison him on charges of conspiracy against her and the principality! Now aided by Count Balakhnin, the princess has been declared “Princess-Regent” and began to purge the principality of her enemies. But not all is well for Anna, for Prince Alexy has died in his prison cell a few short weeks after his fall from power. Currently Yaroslavl, whose prince is the cousin of Alexy, is enraged by his imprisonment. Should he find out that the Green Prince is dead, we’ll be in great trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.A;Keep calm and don’t let the truth leak;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.T;Prince Alexy’s becomes public!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.D;Our fears have manifested! The death of Prince Alexy has become public due to a leak by one of the prison’s officers. We haven’t heard from Yaroslavl yet, but since they never recognized Mikhail as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, they might just claim the principality for themselves as the only legitimate member of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.A;Call the army! Prepare for the worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.T;Alexy Belsky dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.D;To our shock Prince Konstantin’s cousin, Prince Alexy, has died! He has succumbed to illness in a Nizhgorodian cell. Our court naturally blames his death on the negligence of his traitorous wife who imprisoned him in the first place, Anna Lyapunov. Due to our stance on the princess’ son, Mikhail, as an illegitimate heir, we may have an opportunity to claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod back! Naturally, we must expect Moscow to come to the aid of Anna Lyapunov, as the princess is from its royal family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.A;Vengeance for Belsky’s blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.B;Can we afford to antagonize Moscow?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.T;Moscow advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.D;Moscow has moved into Nizhny Novgorod, seizing unlawfully what is naturally the integral and rightful land of the principality. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls for the reclamation of Yaroslavl’s birthright, and for dismemberment of the vain muscovites!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.A;We musn’t let Moscow get away with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.B;We can’t afford to challenge Moscow...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.T;Yaroslavl advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.D;Yaroslavl has already occupied Ivanovo for long enough, but now Yaroslavl has exploited the chaos in the principality and moved into Nizhny Novgorod itself, completing their vile conquest of what would be better off in our hands. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls to put Yaroslavl’s crime to an end, and to restore the honor and glory of Moscow and her prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.A;We mustn't let Yaroslavl covet what’s ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.B;We can’t afford to challenge Yaroslavl...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.D;Our prince and his loyal army have marched out to meet greedy Yaroslavl in battle! And victorious our prince and country are. By beating Yaroslav back, and asserting our rightful claim to Nizhny Novgorod, we have gotten closer to our dream of a Russian empire. Let prince Konstantin fear our advance, for no petty principality can stop Moscow’s destiny now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.A;Moscow emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.D;Belsky’s birthright is once again restored! Our rightful claim to the principality of Nizhny Novgorod, that has been confirmed already by the right of blood, has now been confirmed by the right of conquest! Moscow is beaten and has fled back to their own land, while Prince Konstantin celebrates our successful campaign in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.A;Yaroslavl emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.T;Moscow offers annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.D;In an expected delegate from Moscow, Princess Anna has received an offer from Prince Peter III of Moscow: the cession Nizhny Novgorod in return for monetary compensation for the princess-regent. Princess Anna may retire to live the rest of her life in leisure if she cedes the principality to her family’s hands. The court patiently awaits the princess’ response...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.A;Princess Anna accepts the deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.B;Princess-regent Anna rejects the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.T;The Generalissimo of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.D;Years ago, Talantsev was a minor noble coming from a Chuvash elder family that had made fortune on the Volga between the Khanate of Kazan and the Russian principalities. His talents were recognized and he gained rank thanks to the affection of Anna Lyupanova. But in the end he took power in the troubled times that faced Nizhny Novgorod abolishing the principality and taking the helm. He defended the independence of the city and proved to the people that he was a natural leader. Thanks to his new popularity he was able to crush boyar opposition and proclaim the end of serfdom. Now he has turned back on its Tatar allies claiming to free the people of Tartariya from slavery as he liberated serfs. This could serve him in the next fights against the Princes of Russia, and maybe he can become the providential man needed to unify the eastern Slavs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.A;Long live the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.T;The Princess of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.D;Anna Lyapunova won against all odds. A princess whose sole job was to marry and produce an heir, she managed to surpass every expectations, sidelining her husband and ruling over the principality in its most troubled times. A master of intrigue she went from regent for her son Mikhail to princess ruling in her own right. The Duma has been abolished after her control over the state was affirmed and her first ukaze as autocrat of Nizhny Novgorod was to free the serfs living under her rule. The people have forgotten the scandals that surrounded her while Alexey was still around and she has been nicknamed the 'Mother of the People' by many pamphlets and all her trips over the country see crowds of former serfs gather to acclaim her. This opinion is shared by many in her home in Moscow, with many abolitionists looking up to the rising figure of the Lyapunov family to unify the principalities and maybe then all Russia !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.A;Long live the Princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.T;The Survival of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.D;Against all odds, Nizhny Novogrod has survived when by all means it should have been dissolved during the previous crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.A;Long live the... somebody?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.T;Threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is one of the main instigators behind the current situation in Russia. When at the apex of its power, the Polish Crown claimed the title of Prince of the Rus and invaded the Principalities provoking the Troubles (1592-1613). More recently they were the main instigators of the Nizhny Novgorod war, and Smolensk only regained its independence thanks to the decay of the Polish state apparatus. But now the new King of the Commonwealth has reformed the state and the country is now again a major force in Europe. The Princes of Russia must unite if they want to have a chance against the Polish Leviathan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.A;A new troubled Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.T;The Nordic threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.D;The Scandinavians have intervened in Russia for centuries, as Rurik and Oleg settled and founded Rus while Novgorod fought Swedish and Danish attacks in the times of Alexander Nevsky. More recently the Republic of the North was forced to release the Republic of Pskov that then acquired the Baltic coast. Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. Now the Scandinavians have attacked Novgorod and acquired proper Russian territory. It is an insult to all independent powers in Russia and has prompted every ruler to arm its subjects to unify the country once and for all, lest we are played once again by other powers and the Motherland is carved by them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.A;For the glory of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.T;Loss of Nordic influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. But now Scandinavian's influence is waning as events in Finland have provoked independence of core territories of the Nordic Crown. The states in Central Russia are now left to their own devices as no Great Power can actually reach out to them, and the unification of Central Russia should be swift and decisive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.A;Unification or death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.T;A rumor in Russia...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.D;Central Russia has been never truly unified as all attempts failed due to foreign powers interventions and local fighting forces. Ivan III of Moscow, Dimitri I of Tver, Feodor II of Yaroslav all look down on what Russia has become and what could have been. There is a rising sentiment that Russia must evolve to survive in the modern world and that the divisions must go away for a new nation emerge and protect the Motherland from all threats. Now is the time to forge a new Principality of Rus that will avenge the woes that Russia has suffered over the centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.A;But please do not repeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.T;The Muscovite Wars era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.D;Tensions had grown between the principalities of Central Russia over the last decades, only tampered by the possibility of foreign intervention. Now that this threat is gone, every leader in Central Russia wants to claim the title and power of the Grand Principality of Rus, which few rulers could claim in the history of Russia. No longer shall Central Russia be divided, and the masses are armed and ready for the coming fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.A;A new Central Russia will emerge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS73.T;The Unification of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS73.D;From the ashes of the divided principalities of Central Russia emerges Muscovy, following the path traced by Ivan III the failed 'Tsar', Dimitri I 'the Savior' and Feodor II of Yaroslav. The Muscovite wars have claimed countless lives and now soldiers go back to their fields and cities to renew with a more normal life. This is the first stage for a new Russia to emerge but to avoid the fates of those who failed before, the ruler of Muscovy must now administrate the new lands under their control and let the land and its inhabitants rest before they take on new enemies and forge a true Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS73.A;The first victory in the series of many!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS74.T;The Muscovite Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS74.D;We must take on our neighbours once and for all, time is of the essence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS75.D;The era is full of wars and our neighbour $FROMCOUNTRY$ just attacked us, we must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS75.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS76.T;The Unification of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.D;Woe be upon us! Our worst fears have been realized! After a period of anarchy, the princes of central Russia have been united into a single nation. Now the Russians stand united against their external enemies, and we can only pray that they show leniency in their dealings with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.A;We shall not go down without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.T;Submission to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.D;After having won out over the other Russian princes, the ruler of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now claims sovereignty over the entire Russian nation -- at least, what they perceive it to be. Unfortunately for us, their perceptions of Russia include the lands of our nation. A representative from the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, demanding our annexation. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.A;Can we even resist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.B;These pretenders shall never have control of our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.T;Submission of the Cossack Hosts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.D;By force or guile we have usurped the other princes and obtained a dominant position in the Russian heartland. Having secured the home front, our interests now look towards the Russians not yet united with our nation. Despite a diverse set of origins, the Cossacks are ultimately Russian in language, culture, and religion, making the independent hosts of the Wild Fields an integral part of the Russian nation. Being part of the first Russian states to live free from foreign meddling, surely the spirit of the Russian dream lives in the people of the hosts! We will petition the rulers of the independent hosts to willingly accept annexation to the growing Russian state. Those that refuse may find their people liberated from their tyrannical rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.A;The Cossacks are Russians: they must be a part of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.T;The Unification of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Russian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.D;Emerging from the chaos that embroiled the south, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has succeeded in uniting the disparate principalities of central Russia into a single unified state. They now stand as the sole power in central Russia, powerful enough and secure enough to challenge the remaining Russian states in their quest to obtain dominance over all Russia. It remains clear to all observers that $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeks the complete unification of the Russian nation -- a project that naturally includes the lands of northern Russia. Many among us see benefits to be had in our joining a unified Russian state. Depending on what they may offer us, we may even choose to willingly unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$. It remains to be seen, however, whether we can reconcile our differences, but at the very least we will hear them out on any offers they may make -- it certainly beats fighting a war over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.A;Let them know that we are listening. Now it is up to them to reciprocate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.D;For some time now the inherent contradictions in the structure of the confederation have caused the rise of factionalism within our government, with the ever-present threat of the Russians from the south the only factor uniting these factions in support of the confederation. However, with recent events, these factions have come to a head, throwing the entire confederation into disarray. Princes and republics alike are in open revolt against the authority of the Prince of Novgorod, with neither party satisfied with his rule. The Prince retains authority only over the city of Novgorod and the surrounding territories, and with any attempts at compromise being too little and too late, the remaining representatives of the Veche and the Council of Lords have unanimously declared dissolved the Novgorodian Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.A;If only we had reformed sooner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.T;Secret Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.D;It is absolutely obvious that the reunification of Russia is impossible without Novgorod. Its current masters, the Prince and his puppeteers, however, are weak and cannot control anything outside the city itself. We have a favorable offer for them - in exchange for recognition of our monarch's authority, they will all receive large estates and, ahem, monetary compensation. Our diplomats have already left for Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS80.A;Time to end the Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS81.T;Palace Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS81.D;Despite the fact that the Prince himself suddenly showed no desire to give up the phantom remnants of his power, those respectable gentlemen behind him forced him to swear an oath to the ruler of All Russia. For this, all those involved received large estates as well as a solid annual pension. Those few who refused to obey the outsiders from the south began a desperate, but pointless and short struggle - soon they will all obey the Tsar, of that there can be no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS82.T;The Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS82.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our monarch's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we offer the rulers of Novgorod nobility, large estates, and a decent pension, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will also make it clear to them that, if they refuse, a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.T;An Offer for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS83.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. In exchange for loyalty oaths, our elites are offered substantial land grants, nobility, and a pension from the Grand Prince. This offer could only be laughed at if it were not for the second part: if we refuse, we are threatened with war. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS84.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our dictator's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we threaten the rulers of Novgorod with a war, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will make it clear to them - a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.A;Simple as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS85.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. We are ordered to obey. If we do not recognize their sovereignty over Novgorod, they threaten to declare war on us. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.T;Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS86.D;The Republic and its future are the responsibility of every citizen. This is the main principle of our state, expressed by its founder. The idea of the unification of the Russian lands has long agitated the minds of many citizens of our republic. In recent years the Novgorod Republic has become much weaker than before, and the most audacious liberals among us have floated the idea of holding a plebiscite in Novgorod to unite with other Russian lands.It is absolutely clear that the citizens of Novgorod, tired of instability, will choose a strong and united Russia, so we should only wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.A;Get the champagne ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS87.T;Great Unification Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS87.D;When diplomats from the south came to propose a plebiscite on reunification, many were skeptical. At this point, however, it is obvious to all that the Novgorod Republic is over, and the end of our independence is only a matter of time. In the plebiscite held today, the proposal for reunification received an absolute majority of votes. On the streets, people rejoice at the end of the turbulent instability and look forward to the bright future - a future in a unified Russian republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS87.A;Better them than Scandies, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRUS89.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRUS90.T;The end of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS90.D;The greater Novgorodian Republic, our former master, is now gone. A new hegemon has bent over the ruins of the ancient city, and now we are all alone in the face of an imminent threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS90.A;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.T;Question of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS91.D;Now, with Novgorod gone, we have to make a decision. Should we join the new Russian hegemon voluntarily? No official ambassadors have been sent to us to propose annexation, but it is absolutely clear that such a thing will happen soon. If we do not join now, we will be forced to face the military force of a united Russia -- a force that will be difficult, if not impossible, to defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.B;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.T;Pan-Russianism in Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.D;While Lord Novgorod the Great has managed to resolve its internal struggles, it has thus far remained divorced from the affairs of the other Russian principalities. Novgorod's isolation has upset the pan-Russian factions within Novgorod, who believe that the city should leverage its influence and unite the disparate Russian states into a single nation. Our recent ascent however has convinced many supporters of the pan-Russian movement in Novgorod that $COUNTRY$ and not Novgorod is the true heir of Rurik, and to that end we have taken the opportunity to aid our brethren within Novgorod in fulfilling our destiny as the natural leader of all Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.A;Novgorod must bend her knee to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.T;The Pan-Russian Revolt of $year$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.D;While pan-Russian demonstrations have become common in recent years, the successful reassertion of our hegemony over the confederation has de-legitimized most such movements, allowing us to keep them in check. However, a pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has recently broken out all across the country, paralyzing communications and diverting our forces away from the capital. Taking advantage of the chaos, a group of partisans has advanced on the Veche and the Council of Lords in an attempt to coerce them into electing the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as Prince of Novgorod. While there can be no doubt that our southern neighbors are responsible for this attempted coup, our main concern is to deal with the threat of these rebels. How shall we react?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.A;Our forces have been overwhelmed. Stand down lest there be more unnecessary bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.B;All is not yet lost! We will eject these would-be usurpers from Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.T;Union with Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.D;After some initial difficulties, the pan-Russian revolters we supported have succeeded in uniting Lord Novgorod the Great to our nation! Our king has been confirmed as the rightful Prince of Novgorod by both the Novgorodian Veche and the Council of Lords. After centuries of independence, however, the people of Novgorod are reluctant to accept the rule of what many see as a foreign usurper of the title of Prince. Armed bands of peasants and former Novgorodian garrisons alike rove the countryside, extorting the populace and thwarting our efforts to effect any sort of control over much of Novgorod. While Novgorod may now be ours -- that much will not change -- it will be some time before we can integrate these lands effectively into our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.A;With this union we have been saved from causing unnecessary bloodshed. Now we must reconcile with Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.T;Pan-Russian Separatists Flee South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.D;Despite some initial victories, the soldiers of Novgorod managed to hold key positions within the city of Novgorod, including the Veche and the Prince’s palace. With the initial shock of the uprising having worn off, the pan-Russian separatists were no longer able to compensate for the irregular nature of their forces, and having found themselves steadily losing ground to the armies of Novgorod, the pan-Russian rebels hastily withdrew from the city. Similar word has been heard throughout the rest of Novgorod, with pan-Russian rebels having been routed by local garrisons and even peasant militias hostile to their brigandry. Those surviving groups of rebels have fled across the border to their masters in the south, and only time will tell how our southern neighbor will react to this failed plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.B;Let us hope these fleas do not signal the arrival of rats from the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.T;The Conference of Kostroma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.D;With $COUNTRY$'s consolidation of power over the formerly independent princes of central Russia, Russians everywhere excitedly convene to discuss the imminent completion of Russian unification. In $CAPITAL$ and in Novgorod alike, intellectuals gather at coffeehouses to debate the nature a unified Russian nation should take, and everywhere one can find ministers and statesmen working to make the Russian dream a reality. The newest source of gossip in these circles is the ongoing Conference of Kostroma between $COUNTRY$ and Novgorod. $COUNTRY$ has been attempting to peacefully form some sort of union with Novgorod, uniting the Russian people into a single nation. To that end, $COUNTRY$ has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of Novgorod and subsequently the future of the entire Russian nation. Russians everywhere await with bated breath to see what the results of such a referendum would be, or even if the Novgorodian government would agree to such a proposal in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.A;The unification of Russia is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.T;A Referendum for the Future of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.D;Having previously agreed to conduct a referendum throughout the entirety of Novgorod regarding our possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have now counted the final tally. The results are clear: union with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has won a majority. However, while the pan-Russian supporters have won a majority, their majority is not overwhelming, and a large portion of our population still supports the independence of our state. Supporters of our independence within the government have begun to congregate and scheme to preserve the existence of the Novgorodian state. While it would alienate large parts of the populace, we could lend their movement our tacit support and renege on the results of the referendum. Such a move, however, would certainly infuriate our southern neighbor and render our government as little more than a puppet of the independence faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.A;We will respect the will of the Novgorodian people. Russia shall be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.B;$FROMCOUNTRY$ will have to pry Novgorod from our cold, dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ thought they could woo us with promises of the preservation of our ancient rights, guaranteed positions within the new government, and financial compensation for titles lost. It seems that they do not understand that our sovereignty is not for sale, and that we will not give in to their demands. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has left the conference infuriated with what they denounce as “pig-headed obstinacy,” meanwhile we have satisfied ourselves with having driven home our right to sovereignty to these foreigners. Hopefully this will finally put to rest all this nonsense of “Russian unification” and we can return to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.A;Surely nothing could go wrong with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.T;Talks Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.D;Despite our overtures of a peaceful and equitable union between our two nations, and despite our promises to ensure that all parties involved were duly compensated, the Novgorodians have rejected any offers to unite with us. The Conference of Kostroma has been deemed a failure, causing us embarrassment for having even considered negotiation with such pig-headed fools. One of our ministers has approached us with one last-ditch effort at unification with Novgorod before the situation escalates into a full-scale war. Pan-Russian undercurrents flow strongly within the Novgorodian populace, and the harsh Novgorodian regime has led many in Novgorod to consider $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule to be more tenable than that of the Novgorodians. Our ministers have been in contact with a pan-Russian secret society called the Yaroslavl Circle for some time now, but were we to provide money and matériel we could inspire them to action. A successful uprising aimed at toppling the authoritarian Novgorodian government would surely install a government more amenable to our offers of Russian unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.A;We shall support this pan-Russian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.T;The Yaroslavl Circle Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.D;While the pan-Russian tide has been rising in recent years, our government has been overall successful in quashing any sort of dissent that would threaten Novgorod. Until now, that is. A pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has broken out across the entire nation. Prominent officers and even whole garrisons have defected to their cause, leaving the entire Novgorodian army in disarray. The rebels, calling themselves the Yaroslavl Circle, already control a number of important cities and have begun to advance on the city of Novgorod in an attempt to restore the republic and elect the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as the new Prince of Novgorod. Given their aims and their weapons there can be no doubt that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is responsible for this uprising, most likely in the event of talks breaking down. And given the rebels' success, perhaps we should have taken $FROMCOUNTRY$'s original offer for unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.A;Salvage what we can, we will make peace with these rebels if they ensure our security!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.B;Never! We will turn these peasant hordes back to the fields and hovels from which they emerged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.T;The Invasion of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.D;Having consolidated our hold over central Russia, the only thing standing in the way of our complete domination over the whole of Russia is the Novgorodian Confederation. Having decided to forego the diplomatic approach, we have already begun to mobilize our armies in preparation for a sneak attack on this last barrier to Russian unification. We are the sole masters of Russia, the true heirs of Rurik, and the people of Novgorod will soon learn that for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.A;Prepare the attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.T;A Grand Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation stands on the cusp of unification. Against all odds, our republic has beaten out the old autocratic regimes of central Russia, uniting the formerly independent principalities to our own nation. At this moment, the majority of the Russian nation lives under our banner. The only remaining holdout preventing the realization of the Russian dream is Novgorod. While not the model upon which our democracy is based, the Novgorodian Confederation is nonetheless the most significant source of inspiration for our nascent republic. It was in Novgorod that the Russian nation first knew what it meant to be ruled by the people, and while the centuries were tumultuous, it was Novgorod that kept alive the flame of Rurik and of democracy in Russia. As we share this common ground of democracy with the Novgorodians, and as the Russian people yearn for the unification of the nation, let us come to terms with Novgorod in order to unite Russia as one people under one republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.A;Russia shall be united under liberal democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.T;A Grand Unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation is on the cusp of unification. To our south, the autocratic princes of the old order have been vanquished, replaced by a confederation ruled by the once-oppressed Russian people themselves. Meanwhile, our own confederation has stood the test of time, preserving the flame of Rurik even in the face of threats external and internal. Having discussed back and forth with our newly-liberated southern neighbors, and despite the differences in our ancient traditions, the Novgorodian Veche has decreed that it is time democracy reign in Russia: Lord Novgorod the Great will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$ for the good of the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.A;We will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.B;Novgorod will lead this new confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.T;A Diplomatic Approach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.D;Against all odds, our republic has prevailed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, uniting the formerly autocratic principalities into a single state ruled by the people. The Russian nation now stands on the brink of unification, with the sole remaining thorn in our side being the Novgorodian Confederation. While the original inception of Novgorod as a confederation of equals served as a spiritual precedent for our own government, the ancient institutions of the Novgorodian Confederation have proven to be non-adaptive to the demands of a modern republic. In many ways Novgorod is a shell of its former self, having de-emphasized or even completely curtailed many of its democratic traditions in favor of a more autocratic style of rule. Despite this, it is imperative that the Russian nation be unified under the banner of democracy, and we must come to some agreement with the Novgorodians in order to accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.A;Make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.T;An Offer from the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.D;Emerging from the chaos that had embroiled the south, the peasant hordes that the southern princes once lorded over have overthrown their masters and achieved dominance over central Russia. While noble in intention, these peasants have proven incapable of grasping the subtleties of our ancient institutions, and in their attempts to imitate them under the guise of "liberalism" the people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made a mockery of our nation's legacy with their republic. And it is this bastardization of our ancient confederation that has dared claim the legacy of Rurik. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently sent us a diplomatic proposal demanding that we submit to them. Refusal would most likely mean war. Our surrender would not be without generous compensation, but it would certainly mean the loss of our sovereignty and our privileged position as the middleman between Russia and the rest of Europe. Honor demands that we reject their proposal, but pragmatism says otherwise. Which consideration will win out in the end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.A;Their offer is admittedly generous. We begrudgingly accept annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.B;We will never submit to peasants who cannot understand the subtleties of our confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.D;With our refusal to accept the offer of our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Many of our top strategists are advocating a policy of pre-emptive action, favoring a surprise attack on key locations just across the border. The armies of our enemy will take quite a while to mobilize completely: by striking first, we can negate their numerical advantage. With our forces outnumbered, they argue that this is the only way we can ensure our victory in the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.A;We must strike first, to ensure our own independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.B;Such a move would be dishonorable. We must not stoop so low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.D;With our refusal to submit to our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Due to our numerical disadvantage, it is important that we strike first before the armies of our enemies are able to mobilize their forces. Otherwise we risk giving our enemy the time necessary for them to organize their armies to counter our offensive. These upstarts from the south will learn that we, not they, are the true heirs of Rurik! Russia shall be ours and ours alone to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.A;We must strike first in order to ensure our mastery over all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.T;The Figurehead Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.D;Having obtained the success we have over the other Russian principalities, it is clear that our king possesses the divine right to rule over the whole of the Russian nation. The Prince of Novgorod remains the only man left standing in open defiance of our rule. The Prince, however, is little more than a figurehead in Novgorod: the true power of that state lies in its nobility, whose loyalties can be bought. If we make a proper offering to these petty nobles we can entirely bypass the rule of this so-called "Prince" and defeat Novgorod without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.A;Forget this “Prince,” we only seek to negotiate with those who possess actual power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.T;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.D;It is no surprise that this self-proclaimed "Tsar" in $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the end of the Novgorodian state. What does come as a shock, however, is the means by which he has recently attempted to effect it. The prince of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has completely foregone diplomatic channels with our nation and has instead attempted to conduct individual dealings with the nobility. This abominable act is both a flagrant disregard for our status as an independent state and a personal insult to the authority of the Prince of Novgorod! While a few may have turned coat, those of whom we will punish severely later, the majority have rejected the offer of $FROMCOUNTRY$, professing loyalty to the Prince of Novgorod. Hopefully with this, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will know that neither our nobility nor our sovereignty can be bought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.A;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.T;The Plot Against the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.D;Surprisingly, the Novgorodian nobles have for the most part rejected our generous offer! Perhaps this figurehead prince holds more sway within Novgorod than we had initially realized. If we are able to get this prince out of the picture, however, surely we will see the mass defections of the Novgorodian nobility to our cause! Within Novgorod are various narodniks with anti-monarchical sentiments. While they may be dangerous to us in the long run, for now at least our ministers assure us that any one of these groups would readily serve as our unwitting agents in an attempt to assassinate the Prince of Novgorod, so long as we provide them the necessary support and obscure its origins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.A;We need not stoop so low ourselves. Let these peasants kill their lowly prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.T;An Assassination Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.D;A bomb has been thrown at the prince’s carriage in an attempt to end his life! While the prince is unharmed, the question remains who would orchestrate such an act? The captured terrorists claim connection to some obscure narodnik organization. While the connection is credible, the group they name, while not necessarily unknown to us, is one with little history of previous action and is known to have had limited resources. It seems unlikely that this organization acted on its own. Further investigation reveals that known members of the group have in recent weeks made trips to the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Considering the recent fallout between our two nations, it becomes clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ wished to create a power vacuum in our nation in order to encourage the defection of the nobility. We will stand insult no longer! If $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not respect our sovereignty, then perhaps we shall not recognize theirs! The people of the south live oppressed under the rule of this self-proclaimed “Tsar,” and it is our sacred duty to liberate them and unite the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.A;We shall make them pay for endangering the life of the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.T;The Divine Right of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.D;Having gained dominance over the formerly independent principalities of central Russia, it is clear -- to us at least -- that God favors us, and that we rule all Russia by divine right. These Novgorodians, however, fail to see how providence favors us. They persist in choosing rulers amongst themselves in what is little more than a glorified popularity contest, ignoring our rightful place as lords of Novgorod and Tsar of all Russia. However, they shall ignore us no longer! We have sent them an ultimatum demanding their complete and unconditional surrender. Should they fail to comply, we shall reign down destruction upon Novgorod the likes of which has never before been seen under heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.A;As God wills it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.T;The Reply of the Novgorodian Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.D;It is no secret that the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the our lands. His rhetoric proclaiming a divine right to rule all Russia, and his usage of the title “Tsar” are indicative enough of his intentions. Thus, the most recent communiqué from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador comes as no surprise to any of the representatives in the Novgorodian Veche: $FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded the dissolution of our republic and our annexation to their nation. Failure to do so will result in our “complete and wholesale destruction for defying the will of God.” Naturally, we have brushed aside his threats, though we have not sent his ambassador home empty handed. Having long expected this upcoming war, the Novgorodian Veche has unanimously approved a message addressed personally to this “Tsar” denouncing him as "$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ devil and damned devil's kith and kin,” and informing him that he “shall no longer, son of a whore, make slaves of Russian men.” Should he come, this Muscovite scullion will find himself stripped of his crown by the hands of the Russian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.A;Screw thine own mother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.T;Detente with Novgorod?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.D;Having triumphed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, our nation has achieved dominance over the Russian heartland. Now the only stumbling block to Russian unification is our relationship with Novgorod. Novogord has never been on the most friendly of terms with the southern principalities. Nevertheless since achieving preeminence in the Russian heartland we have worked to improve our relations with the Novgorodian state. Recently we have begun diplomatic talks with the Novgorodians in order to see what terms, if any, they would consider acceptable in order to achieve political unification. Hopefully these talks will bear fruit and we will see the creation of a pan-Russian state, or at least the pathway to one. And if not, there are always other means by which to continue policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.A;Peace shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.T;The Diplomatic Farce;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.D;Despite the overtures of compromise, talks with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have proven to be little more than a farce! The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats refuse to budge on even the most simple of issues, rejecting reasonable proposals that would ensure our interests are protected. All the while, we have noted that the armies of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have begun to amass along the border. Many in Novgorod believe that these talks were meant as little more than a means by which $FROMCOUNTRY$ could stall in order to adequately mobilize their armies. The situation has recently come to a head, with Novgorodian sailors having been arrested by the soldiers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ for exercising their right to river navigation. With this final insult we refuse to negotiate any further with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Everyone from the coffeehouse intellectual, to the paper-pushing bureaucrat, and even the most pigheaded reactionary now sees that a unified Russia is inevitable. We must strike first and strike hard to ensure that we are the ones to head this new Russian order, and not our enemies in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.A;Let slip the dogs of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.T;A Pro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.D;As we have assumed mastery of the Russian heartland, we are now able to effectively utilize the resources of this rich land to expand our power outwards throughout the rest of Russia. Our first target of conquest is the ancient city of Novgorod, the heart of the Novgorodian Confederation to our north. Having ultimately decided to forego diplomacy with the Novgorodians, we have sent insurgents across the border to attempt to lead a revolution under the guise of a pan-Russian rebellion in order to install a new regime friendly to our cause. Soon we shall know of their results, and whether we will have to openly intervene or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.A;Novgorod will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.T;The Oath at the Holy Wisdom Cathedral;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently attempted to suborn our independence by sending over insurgents in an attempt to overthrow our government. Naturally the majority of them were intercepted before ever reaching the capital, but the fact that they would resort so such means has created fear everywhere that the whole of Russia might soon become subject to the tyrants in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Russian pan-nationalists everywhere call upon Novgorod to take up the mantle of Rurik and fulfil her destiny at unifying Russia. Even within $FROMCOUNTRY$ word reaches us of suppressed uprisings and demonstrations in favor of a Novgorodian-led Russian nation-state. This morning, on the steps of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral in the city of Novgorod, our generals and our soldiers pledged an oath to end the despotic government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and unite the Russian nation under Novgorod much like Rurik did a millennium prior. After kneeling before the metropolitan and receiving his blessing, the armies of Novgorod departed the city and marched south to wage war for the soul of the Russian nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.A;We shall dethrone these tyrants and liberate Russia from their grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.D;The chaos that not long ago plagued the lands of the southern principalities has now reached the people of Novgorod. Already the drums of war sound over the horizon, signaling the arrival of war to the towns and villages that dot the lands of northern Russia. The fate of the entire Russian nation hangs on the outcome of this war. Will $COUNTRY$ unify all of Russia under its rule? Or will Novgorod succeed in asserting its independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.A;The final battle for the fate of all Russia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.T;Victory over Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.D;The armies of Novgorod have been defeated! After nearly a millennium of existence, the Novgorodian Confederation has been vanquished by its external enemies. In its place we have assumed direct control over the former lands of the confederation. The veche has been dissolved and a temporary administration over the city has been set up. There will be much reconciliation to be accomplished between former enemies but one thing remains certain: Russia is now united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.A;And nevermore to be separated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.T;A Devastating Defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.D;Despite outnumbering the forces of Novgorod by a significant margin, our armies proved unable to leverage that advantage in the field. Long supply trains stretching through hostile lands, armies bogged down in the swamps of Novgorod, and attrition from the harsh Russian winter all ensured that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Army remained just the opposite of that. What really won the war for Novgorod, however, was the defeat and capture of an 80,000 strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army by a Novgorodian force less than half its size. With such an embarrassing defeat and the subsequent capture of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general Novgorod has succeeded in forcing us to recognize their status as an independent nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.A;Is a unified Russia destined to remain no more than just a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.D;Early this morning we received a communiqué from Novgorod declaring that a state of war now exists between us and the Novgorodian state. It was less than an hour before further reports started to flood in relating the loss of key positions along our northern border to the advancing armies of Novgorod. The bastards in Novgorod have struck first, and our forces are now in disarray! We must mobilize every man possible to drive back this treacherous enemy, for the fate of the entire nation -- nay, the soul of mother Russia herself -- lies on the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.A;The earth itself trembles as armies march across the fields of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.D;After a long and bitter struggle, we have finally vanquished the treacherous armies of Novgorod. After surviving flood, fire, and enemy for nearly a millennium, it is us who has finally brought an end to the Novgorodian Confederation. With the downfall of Novgorod, the flame of Rurik now passes on to us as the true masters of the Russian nation! Much reconciliation will need to occur between both sides, but one thing remains certain: Russia stands unified under us, never again to be broken apart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.A;Russian unification is finally at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.T;Novgorod Triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.D;For a thousand years our nation has stood and for a thousand years more shall we stand! The armies of the south have been decisively defeated! Against all odds we have come out victorious against our southern neighbor. While there will be much hardship to be had in the future as we rebuild Russia from the ground up, now is a time of jubilation! No longer shall foreigners speak of the Russian principalities in the plural, for now there exists only one Russian nation to speak of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.A;The flame of Rurik guides our path! Onwards to Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.T;An Uneasy Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.D;With both sides having exhausted themselves, diplomats from Novgorod and $COUNTRY$ have come together to negotiate the end of the war. Despite years of conflict, no decisive victory has been won by either side, and in the end what was supposed to be a war to decide the fate of Russia resulted in little more than some minor border changes. Neither side is satisfied with the result but both sides welcome the relief that peace has brought. Already, though, politicians from both sides are calling for the renewal of conflict, and have reasserted the right of each nation to rule over the other. What was ironically termed a treaty of perpetual peace now seems unlikely to last longer than a few years at most. There lies no doubt in anyone's mind that this conflict over the soul of the Russian nation will remain unresolved until one side ceases to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.A;The final battle for Russia has yet to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.T;The Grand Principality Looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.D;Not satisfied with just their hold over central Russia, the Grand Principality of Rus hungrily eyes the lands of the Cossacks to the south. While we would normally be ambivalent to the affairs of the Cossacks, the radical change in the geopolitical situation to our south has demanded our attention. This unified central Russian state poses a major threat to the sovereignty of Novgorod, and given how the Grand Principality of Rus has acted towards the Cossacks one can only imagine their ambitions towards us. It is imperative that we prepare to intervene against the ambitions of this new power in Russia, lest we find ourselves alone to face their might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.A;Mobilize our forces, we must stand ready in the event that they act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.B;We are unconcerned with the affairs of a bunch of illiterate horseback riders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.T;Novgorod Takes Action;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.D;The unification of central Russia has been met with hostility on all sides. It seems the Novgorodians, discontent with the creation of our new state, have begun to act in order to dismember it piecemeal. All along our northern border Novgorodian troop movements have been observed, and word reaches us of a partial mobilization of the Novgorodian army for seemingly inexplicable reasons. If the Novgorodians continue with these acts of aggression we will be forced to act against them in order to preserve our sovereignty. However, we will open talks with the Novgorodians and see what, if anything, can be done to resolve the situation peacefully. Who knows, perhaps we may even be able to extend discussions to the issue of Russian unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.A;We must seek to resolve our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.T;The Future of Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.D;Having noticed the recent movements of our armies, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us seeking to de-escalate the situation. As talks continued, however, the conversation slowly shifted from a simple detente to a discussion regarding the future of Russia. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made it clear that they seek the complete unification of the Russian nation, which naturally includes our great confederation. In many ways we would likely stand to benefit in the event of the creation of a united Russia -- depending upon the form that this new nation would take. For now at least we shall remain receptive to what $FROMCOUNTRY$ has to say, at least until we can discern whether our images for a unified Russia are compatible or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.A;We shall listen to what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.T;Cossackia Rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.D;To our north, the Novgorodians quarrel with the central Russians over who will lead the Russian nation. Little do either of them realize that the true soul of the Russian nation lies south, in the lands of the Cossacks! As the first Russian nation in centuries to truly live free from foreign enslavement, it is in Cossackia where the flame of Rurik burns brightest! It is our sacred duty to intervene in this war and assert our rightful place as hegemon of all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.A;They shall know who the true masters of Russia are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.B;Perhaps we ought to remain out of this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.T;The Invasion of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.D;For weeks now, forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been spotted amassing at the border. While it was initially believed that they were attempting to crack down on Cossack raids, it has quickly become clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends to invade our nation and annex it to their own. However, we are not the weak and disorganized confederation that they believe us to be. We shall turn the tables on them, and as they have come for us so shall we subjugate them! We must mobilize every man available and strike at $FROMCOUNTRY$ before they can do the same to us, else we lose that independence which embodies the Cossack spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.A;These would-be oppressors won’t know what hit ‘em!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.B;Maybe they will leave us alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.T;The Great Trial for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.D;Sensing our vulnerability, the unified Cossack hordes of the south have launched a sneak attack on us in a desperate bid to seize the whole of Russia. With Novgorod attacking from the north and this new front opened up in the south, the Grand Principality of Rus is assailed by enemies on all sides. But no matter! This war for the livelihood and right to sovereignty of our entire nation has galvanized our people into resisting this onslaught. This is nothing less than the great trial thrust upon us by heaven through which all Russia will be baptized by fire! Our people shall rise up and overcome these hardships, forging a new nation from the ashes of our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.A;Arise, men of Russia, and defend your motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1290.T;The Month of Mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.D;The Princedom of Yaroslavl had been dragged into a medieval dynastic dispute that has resulted into a great loss of life and the further weakening of Yaroslavlian interests in Russia, for nothing. As the overly ambitious Nizhny Novgorod expedition of the Belsky prince ended in bitter failure, the princely family was also struck by disaster as a local smallpox edipedemic ended with Konstantin IV dead along with several of his grandsons. Many had hoped that the prince’s heir could reform and strengthen the state but Paul I ascended the throne in mourning, having lost both his father and his son in the incident and showed little interest in running the state, despite the crucial times. With the head of state retired in his dacha, the autocracy of Yaroslavl could not do anything. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.A;Let us pray for those who left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.T;Rise of the Zemstvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.D;Paul's seclusion led to administrative chaos as the high centralisation wanted by his predecessors backfired due to the Prince's absenteeism. To fund the war, taxes had been raised and corruption had become rampant. The need for reform could not be ignored any further. Parallel institutions grew beside the official administration. In normal times, a Zemtsvo was a provincial assembly mostly made up of nobles and some rich burghers, but sometimes also representatives of serfs and free peasants. While on the outside they presented themselves as charities and cultural circles, offering minimal welfare to the poor, they were the hotbed of opposition to Belsky despotism. Following the Prince’s absence, the Zemtsva spruced up in all towns of the Princedom and began to act in place of the Prince’s agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.A;What is going on in Yaroslavl ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.T;Return of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.D;Prince Paul eventually returned to the political scene after his mourning, with the intent of ruling his state. But he was much surprised by the new state of affairs, despite his new moderate yet still conservative stance. The damage to his authority was huge as the Zemstva had federalised and requested recognition as official institutions of local government. Prince Paul faced a choice : either accept this erosion of his prerogatives or attempt a bold move to deprive the Zemstva of their power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.A;The Prince negotiates with the Zemtsvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.B;The Prince takes action;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.T;The coup succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.D;Paul found himself alone and without political support, and was therefore pressured to ‘peacefully agree’ to sign his abdication without being humiliated. He retreated to one of his countryside mansions, without ever seeing again his son or brother or other members of his family and eventually died due to a firearm wound self-inflicted while trying to make rats flee his bedchamber. His son died of pneumonia, leading to the crowning of Dimitri III Belsky as Prince of Yaroslavl. \n \n He wiped away the Zemstva, persecuting its leaders with secret police and re-establishing the old absolute princely rule. Opposition moved underground and further radicalised, growing closer to marginal intellectual movements advocating emancipation and egalitarianism. The dispossession of many bourgeois, progressive land owners and proto-industrialists staled the princedom's economy, while the political paranoia and rampant reactionarism returned the judicial and administrative system to a paralysed semi-feudal level. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.A;Dimitri rules supreme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.T;The coup backfires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.D;The pro-coup faction was curbed by the opposition of Princess-Dowager Irene, despite her old age and attempts to cut her off from the court. A letter gave Paul a warning of the incoming coup attempt, allowing him to make the first move and save his throne. Prince Dimitri was imprisoned and many co-conspirators were executed for treason. \n \n Prince Paul co-opts new leaders from the administration and military from the most loyal and moderate members of the Zemstva, giving many middle-class members a chance to raise their societal status. The Zemstvo Union is hollowed out and the control of the princely commissioners becomes effective. Prince Paul must, however, accept some limitations to his absolute power and recognise the growing demand for modernisation, especially regarding the issue of serfdom. The Prince grants a small but meaningful constitution and announces the creation of a commission to plan full emancipation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.A;The good ending ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.T;Anarchy on the Volga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.D;Prince Paul and his sons are brutally killed after resisting the proposal of voluntary abdication and the forced removal on the grounds of insanity. Feeling responsible for the action of the rogue troop, Dimitri refuses the crown despite the acclamation by the reactionary faction. /n /n Sensing the collapse of princely authority, the Zemstvo Union coordinates loyalist troops and crushes the reactionary coup. Under the leadership of major romanticist writer Nikolai Druzhinin, the radical intellectuals and the nobles opposing the return in all forms of Belsky despotism joined forces and drafted a constitution loosely based on the Novgorodian customs. The new High Volga Council accepts the formal sovereignty of the Metropolitan of Tver, while a new complicated hierarchy of Zemstva from the village to the national level exercises political power in the most byzantine way imaginable. \n \n The chaos is absolute and some regions rule themselves in almost complete autonomy from Yaroslavl while remnants of the Belsky family raise militias roaming the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.A;A Republic at all costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.T;The Rostov Edicts backfire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.D;Despite the jubilation of the intellectuals, the reaction to the edicts was poor. The serfs, sensing their transformation into individually taxable citizens, feared the loss of collective Mir responsibility, which safeguarded their right to land and house in face of the ever-hungry tax collectors. While emancipation had been silently longed for centuries many did not see the difference between what life would have been before and after. \n \n The Prince attempted to save the situation by strengthening the Mir assemblies and giving them the opportunity to choose communal property and repartition of land, but attacks against government officials checking the emancipation progress became frequent alongside tax dodging. Then the Miry effectively allied with the Zemstva, which offered increasingly tempting services while preserving the old social order. Prince Paul was forced to temporarily, then permanently, stop the reform without even attempting to expand it to boyar-owned serfs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.A;They don’t know what is good for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.T;The Rostov Edicts work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.D;After some hesitation, the Mir assemblies cautiously took the clearly historical step requested by their sovereign. The reform did not fully modernise the way the rural world worked, but already a few months after the Edicts it became clear that things had started to move. \n \n Tensions rose to the highest level when full Emancipation was proclaimed by Prince Paul, including private-owned serfs. The step was probably taken too early and while the boyars were economically crippled they still had the capabilities to oppose this decision. The "court" and the Prince became distant and hostile as the autocrat felt the full burden of despotism and the responsibility of his gamble. The private-owned muzhiks weren't given enough land and the price they had to pay to their former owners was much higher than the tariff asked to state-owned serfs. Nobles and peasants rattled their sabres, but the Prince cautiously integrated new landowners into the Zemstva and the administration, suppressing the oppositions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.A;Divine rule gets things done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.T;The Rostov Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.D;Prince Paul tried to gain time: most of the boyars of the Zemstva were deeply in debt, usually with state-owned banks, which meant they lacked effective control over them as a growing percentage is mortgaged to support their lifestyle. By gaining political power at the expense of the prince they hope to secure their status by emptying the coffers of the State, turning Yaroslavl into a paralysed and isolationist noble republic like Ryazan and the Commonwealth. \n \n Keeping faith to the unbroken alliance with his people, the Prince knew it was his to duty to guide all his subjects towards a better future. Thus he promulgated the Rostov Edicts which ordered the immediate emancipation of all state-owned serfs. The most important measure is the new power of the Mir (village) assemblies of former state Muzhiks to divide a generous percentage of the land under their jurisdiction between the peasant households, based on family size. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.A;The Prince knows what is good for his subjects!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.T;The Prince's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.D;Prince Paul attempted to gain the reins of the Zemstva by imposing the tutelage of a Prince-appointed commissioner and by making some of the welfare activities offered by the Zemstva a service offered by the state. But administrative efficiency remained low and the new competences taken from the Zemstva make it even harder for the state to administrate. It led to growing hatred toward the Prince among the lowest class, which had had hopes for better standards of living thanks to these services. Discontent also grew in the Belsky family, as cousins and brothers of Paul became convinced that he had become irreparably unfit for rule after the death of his son and his actions were destroying the legitimate authority in Yaroslavl. Dimitri, Paul's brother, was asked by reactionary generals and nobles to lead a coup to imprison and depose his brother and become regent for the young Alexey, Paul's son. Dimitri accepted but the divisions within the Belsky family make the coup attempt less smooth than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.A;A ... coup ??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.T;The vision of Mikhail;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.D;Michael II Repnin has managed to bring back Ryazan to power and unify the Central Russian Lands as no ruler has ever done in the history of Russia. Curtailing the Boyars? powers, their rich estates are now worked in the name of the state. The rich lands of the South now feed the ever growing population of the Grand Principality. With soldiers loyal to him and his ideals of a Russia master of the steppe and thus her destiny, he now turns his eyes south to the Cossack and Tatar lands in which he will forge a new nation upon the ashes of her old enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.T;The realm of the Boyars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.D;The Boyars of Ryazan have withstood the problems caused by Michael II Repnin and held on their prerogatives in power. In the wars that followed, Ryazan emerged victorious, the Duma now becoming the main power responsible for Central Russia. Serfdom still is an important piece of the nation, and it has been used to fuel unprecedented population growth thanks to the rich lands from the South that the peasants from all Russia will now toil in. The aristocracy that guides the new unified Prince of the Rus knows where its interests lie. It is not in Northern Russia, filled with radicals and idealists that the Russian nation will be forged, but in the open lands of the South where lands only demand for the boyars to come and exploit them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.A;For the true nobility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.T;The expansion of the Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.D;The Vozhd of Smolensk rules over the unified Union of Muscovy, contemplating the efforts done in the former years. Inefficient rule of the Assemblies has been sidelined as Smolensk and the whole of Russia needed a strong but benevolent hand. And who but to lead the rising Russian nation but the Vozhd of the People ? Soldiers have been sent to educate the former serfs who are now armed to vanquish the foes of the Vozhd. Boyar rule has ended in central Russia but it is not enough. For the true Slavic nation to appear, blood will need to be spilled as the archaic and free Northerners and Cossacks must be subjugated and learn true Russian Narodnost !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.A;We follow the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.T;Russian Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.D;The Smolenskan Confederation that emerged from the independence has survived and achieved a transition into a Muscovite Confederation ruling over all of Central Russia. Many sought to extinguish the light that emerged in the West, preferring to keep the masses in serfdom and ignorance. But our Republic knows better, it is the era of the masses and we hear the lamentations from our cousins in the North and South who look up to us to realize the ideals of Freedom and Equality in the lands of the Rus. The road ahead will be tough, but a new Nation shall arise, one that will not repeat the mistakes of the past and unify the Slavic people of the East under one flag and one rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.A;For Liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.T;A stable principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.D;The enlightened rule of the Prince of Smolensk and his advisors in the Duma has maintained balance between the ideals of the West and the traditions from Russia. Only Smolensk could modernize Russia without upsetting what made the Russian identity. Masses are now being enlightened by their betters as it should be and while the worst Boyars have been deprived of their powers, all recognize the necessary role of the aristocracy in guiding the Grand Principality. Now the armies of the Rus must march once again to forge a new Slavic Nation in the East, against the unruly Cossacks and the archaic Novgorodians !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.A;Modernity will not sweep all traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.T;The Tsarina looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.D;The Grand Principality of Rus has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod. The grand princess Anna Lyapunova now rules alone over Central Russia, having reconquered her home and beyond while reforming the lands she holds. Boyars are now curtailed by the ever-growing state apparatus while the masses celebrate the ?tsarina?, a title evocating the brief rule of Ivan III and Zoe Palaiologos with whom the Princess has cultivated various ties. With her position secured and the support of the Russian people, Anna looks east and south across the steppes to acquire the land necessary to forge a new nation that could rise to the occasion and become a leading power in the East. Soon the glory of the Tsarina will be discussed over all Europe and all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.A;Long live Anna 'The Mother of Russia'!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.T;The Bear on the march;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.D;The Union of Muscovy has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod, with the Generallisimo Talantsev at her helm. The general has won over the support of the masses of whole Central Russia despite his foreign origins and lowly rank. The old hierarchies have been swept away as the Talantsev squadrons began to apply the new order across the Union. It is time now to look further than the current borders : the Volga has been the blood of Nizhny Novgorod for all its existence and shall become along with the Don the source of the new Russian Nation, as the Tatars are pacified and the lands christianized under the helm of the greatest conqueror the Russians have ever known! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.A;Long live Talantsev! For a more glorious Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.T;The Autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS83.D;Konstantin IV of Iaroslav has vanquished his enemies and reclaimed the legacies of Ivan III, Dimitri I and Feodor II ! An autocrat now rules over the unified Grand Principality of Rus, and never has it been such needed ! The nobility and the clergy needed to be reminded of their subservience to their sovereign while the masses had grown desperate at the hands of unworthy masters. Now the Autocrat sees all and balances the needs of the states justly. But it is only the beginning : soon a new nation will rise from the ashes of the old Russia and it only needs to bend the old Republic of Novgorod to the command of Konstantin to truly rule all the Russias. Then the Russian Crown shall look further west and south to begin the new power of Europe and Asia under the benevolent rule of the only one legitimate sovereign !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS150.T;The Polish Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.D;Now that the wars have ended and Moscow has reunited the old Grand-Duchy of Vladimir and Muscovy, the place of Stanislaw Habsburg has only strengthened. His role in the war, notably his success in leading the charge that gave the final victory over the Belskys of Yaroslavl have made him popular with the soldiery, and he has been given a lavish palace who belonged to the Prince of Nizhny Novgorod as a reward. However, his Liberal stance and his criticism of the Boyars’ rule have attracted him many enemies in court. Moreover, he has not abandoned his Catholic faith and has already clashed with the Patriarch of Moscow several times. Already a pamphlet has been issued anonymously, calling him a Trojan horse of Poland, and calling for all ‘faithful Russians’ to remember the damage the Polish kings brought during the Smuta. The Grand-Prince has already censored the work but many wonder what place Stanislaw will occupy in the new Russia that is being made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.A;He is a national hero for God’s sake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.T;A Threat from Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.D;The escape and then subsequent banishment of Stanislaw Habsburg from Poland was seen by most of the Sejm as the most logical course of action. When they heard he had fled to his brother-in-law in Moscow, most thought they’d never hear of him again. But news from his actions during the Muscovite Wars have been the main focus of many newspapers in Warsaw and the rest of the Commonwealth, notably his heroic charge against the Prince of Yaroslavl. Now the Sejm grows alarmed : Moscow has united and seeks to unite ‘Russia’, a country that wishes to take our lands and people. With Stanislaw at the helm of their armies, who knows what the radicals could do ? Already people discuss a possible split of the Commonwealth between Stanislaw and his brother-in-law and that has made even the most reluctant members of the Sejm agree to rally against our new neighbour : We shall ask them to banish Stanislaw and give back any land that belonged to the Commonwealth, notably Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS151.B;Remember Wladyslaw and the Troubles? We can’t attack Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.T;The Commonwealth Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.D;To the utter astonishment of our entire government, the Commonwealth has become so overwhelmed by its own arrogance that it has seen fit to deliver a demand to us : hand Stanislaw and Smolensk over to them, or face war! From our spies in their nation, it seems that the specter of Stanislaw leading a Muscovite army into the Commonwealth has become too agonizing for them to bear, and so it has driven them to this act of incredible rashness. Our cabinet is almost unanimous in agreeing that to obey this directive would be an intolerable humiliation, yet can we afford to face war when Russia is still not yet unified? We have still not healed from the wars by which Great Russia was united. To face the Commonwealth now, with the question of the north still unanswered, could jeopardize our entire program of Russian unification. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS153.T;Reply of the Muscovite Velikorussians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS153.D;While we had anticipated a lack of cooperation from the Muscovites, few of us ever expected them to reply with such laconic conciseness. A messenger from Muscovy arrived before the Sejm and made a grand display of flourishing a letter replying to our ultimatum, sealed with the sign of the Muscovite ruler, and then addressed him by his long, formal, ostentatious title. However, once the letter was finally unsealed and read, the entire Sejm was astounded at its contents : merely a single word, “No!” At this point the Sejm burst into outrage, with hundreds of nobles demanding the messenger be seized and brutalized for the insult. While several soldiers intervened and escorted the messenger away – for immediate deportation – much of the Sejm is furious that the Muscovites would not only defy us but do so in such a flippant and petulant manner. For the first time in memory, the Sejm’s opinion is united : war with Muscovy is the only way to recover our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS154.D;Despite all of the hardships that we endured, despite all of the sacrifices which we made for the good of Russia, despite all of our hopes, aspirations, and dreams of a people united with a strength not seen since the days of the Kievan Rus’, the Commonwealth has trampled our ambitions beneath the hooves of their winged hussars. With our armies shattered in the field and the government in chaos, Stanislaw was rooted out of hiding and brought back to the Commonwealth for whatever dark fate they have planned for him. Already the Commonwealth is laying out the peace terms they seek to impose upon us, each one another dagger into our chest. As our domestic politics inch closer and closer to the abyss, the first flames of a political explosion beginning to flare up, many of our people wonder : has all of our work been for nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bitter peace of status quo ante bellum has been signed with Muscovy, who is technically the victor of this war, whatever a term like that means at this point. As the peoples of both our nation and theirs turn with newly critical eyes towards their rulers, who drove them to sacrifice so much on their behalf, the halls of power in Warsaw and Moscow are filled with fear for the future.

CRUS155.D;A cataclysm has befallen the Commonwealth. The armies of the Muscovites proved overwhelming, and our attempt to pressure them diplomatically has reaped the bitterest of harvests. With our forces broken and the government in chaos, the Sejm’s resolve quickly faltered and they hurriedly agreed to a long list of Muscovite demands simply to save their own hides. The nation lies burning, as the nobles have once more covered their assets by throwing the country to the wolves at the door. Already news is spreading of the peace terms which the Sejm consented to in order to halt the Muscovite march, each one another knife in our backs. Is this the beginning of the Commonwealth’s end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS156.T;Anarchy in Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.D;The loss of not only Stanislaw, but the entirety of Smolensk, to the Commonwealth has plunged the nation into a level of disorder not seen since the Time of Troubles. Wild-eyed prophets roam the countryside, proclaiming the end of days, while furious boyars denounce the Tsar with a bitterness that would’ve been seen as blasphemy before this crisis began. The chief critic is none other than the Patriarch of Moscow himself, who has begun to question the Tsar’s very fitness to rule! Worse, news is spreading of efforts by several influential boyars to build support for an aristocratic coup against the Tsar. If we want to halt this crisis, extreme measures are needed. Two radical suggestions have been put forward by the Tsar’s advisors : either convert to Unitarianism – which would, at least, deprive the Patriarch of his authority over the Tsar’s government – or organize a massive payout of bribes to the most powerful boyars of the nation. What shall be done to save Muscovy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS157.T;The Patriarch's Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.D;Our efforts to thwart the mobilization of the clergy and the boyars against the Tsar have failed. With public animosity towards the throne finally boiling over, the charismatic and reactionary Patriarch Dmitry of Moscow has decided to take matters into his own hands. A coalition of boyars led an army into Moscow late last night, overpowering the city guards and heading straight to the Moscow Kremlin. Quickly fighting their way inside, they escorted Patriarch Dmitry into the bedroom of the Tsar. Dmitry then anathematized the Tsar for his “degradation of Muscovy, his grievous injuries to the Russian people,” and his “failures to uphold, honor, and obey the will of the Most Holy God.” The anathematized Tsar was dragged to a hastily convened Zemsky Sobor within the Kremlin’s walls, in which the Tsar was officially deposed, and Patriarch Dmitry coronated Dmitry I of the Holy Muscovite Patriarchate. The Tsar may have failed the Russian people, but Patriarch Dmitry, backed by the boyars and guided by God, shall not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.A;Slava Dmitry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.T;Continued Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.D;It seems that not even Patriarch Dmitry could bring instantaneous stability to Muscovy. The disestablishment of the monarchy has greatly aggravated the situation of the countryside. Rural villages, whom the clergy have told for generations that the monarch was God’s primary agent on Earth, have reacted poorly to the news that God’s will shall now be executed by the Patriarch instead. Many have begun to withhold taxes, to the point of violently attacking army units sent to escort tax collectors. Worse, certain religious cults are cropping up as people slander the holy name of Dmitry and accuse him of perverting the will of God! But both problems pale in comparison to the reaction of urban elites and intelligentsia, who have denounced the Patriarch and his seizure of power with unrestrained fury. Cities across the nation have become hotbeds of resistance, with protests and even small riots practically a daily occurrence. The situation is only growing worse with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.A;"Yet though I walk in the shadow of the valley of death...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.T;An Uneasy Calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.D;So far, it appears that Patriarch Dmitry’s swift removal of the Tsar has thrown the opponents of the regime into confusion. Unable to coordinate their opposition, resistance has been limited to various isolated incidents. Yet this may be merely the calm before the storm, as our domestic patrols indicate that unrest may be rising in both the cities and the countryside. For now it seems that all we can do is wait and hope that Muscovy shall finally know peace once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.A;Whatever happens, God shall provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.T;Protests in Every City!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.D;Our worst fears have been confirmed : the calm of the last few weeks was illusory. Over the past few days, liberals and dissatisfied boyars have ignited protests across Muscovy. In almost every major city, crowds have marched through the streets, shouting their denunciation of the government and its failure to address their needs or find an effective foreign policy. Not only have the urban elite stirred their followers up, but even in the countryside, rural communities have begun to fortify their villages, as peasant collectives begin to become more and more like armed camps. Collecting taxes has now gained the occupational hazard of rifle fire from defiant peasants. Law and order is on the verge of breaking down in Muscovy, and there are really only two options if Dmitry wants to maintain power : call out the army and lock down the nation, or gamble his popularity on a massive campaign to unite Russia by fire and sword. If he succeeds in the latter, his name shall be blazed into the heavens. If he fails…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.A;Cloister the country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.B;Commence the Crusade for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.T;The Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.D;Dmitry, Patriarch of Moscow and now ruler of Muscovy, has seen his popularity erode precipitously over the last few weeks. With protests sweeping the nation, he has decided to wage one last desperate campaign to bring all of what he considers the “natural lands of Russia” under his rule. Muscovite armies are now bearing down upon us, and we must make ready to defend ourselves from these mad legions of fanatics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.A;If they seek martyrdom, then we are happy to oblige!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.T;The Great Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.D;With the holy armies of Muscovy now fully assembled, Patriarch Dmitry has given them a benediction. “Loyal sons of Muscovy, sons of Russia, faithful men of God! Before us lies the land of our ancestors, the primordial earth of the Rus’, where our forefathers forged a mighty nation. Yet mighty as she was, her sons did not preserve her, and so squandered their inheritance. For ages, Russia has laid sleeping, unaware of her children’s condition. But now, Russia stirs! She awakes to find herself in the light of God, her strength returning to her. As she draws her sword, she is not alone. She marches to battle with every man and woman in Muscovy who keeps the love of God and the glory of His son, Jesus Christ, in their hearts!” The Patriarch makes a sweep with his hand, towards the horizon. “There, my sons, lies Russia! There lies this ancient, long-slumbering land, this realm of warriors that yearns for one nation, one faith. In the name of most holy God, I implore you : be the instruments of her salvation!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.A;AMEN! §R(DECLARE WAR ON ALL RUSSIAN AND TATAR STATES)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.T;Holy Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, a few blasphemous fools dared to question his wisdom, claiming that God would not protect us as he has done for ages. Once again, however, the doubters have been shamed and shown the error of their ways, and God’s will has triumphed. All of Russia is now under Muscovite hegemony, and the road to unification has never been clearer. Throughout the land – throughout all Russian lands – people are beginning to finally understand Patriarch Dmitry’s role as God’s foremost messenger, and pay him the praise which has been so long overdue. With Russian unity now only a matter of time, the faithful may rest assured that Russia shall retain its holy Christian character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.A;God truly was and is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.T;The Destiny of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, most thought him mad, and saw the war as nothing more than the last desperate act of a power-hungry tyrant. It seems, however, that fate found it a more delicious cruelty to humor his delusions by granting him victory. With the hordes of zealous Muscovites rampaging through our lands, the issue of our place within the future Russian order has, apparently, already been determined. Our only hope is that they shall prove more benevolent masters in peace than in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.A;God help us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.T;The End of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.D;The clocks of Moscow all strike midnight, as a messenger dashes through the city gates. Weaving past rows of field hospitals, through alleys full of tense soldiers, he proceeds to the Kremlin, a dire message in hand. Finally receiving admittance, he approaches the monarch’s quarters to deliver the news : the last Muscovite army has been broken. But, he does not deliver his message – there is nobody to deliver it to. God has called the leader of Muscovy home, and he lies dead, sprawled upon the floor, his Bible still open to the Book of Revelations. /n/n The end of our national stability, and the news of sovereign’s death, has spelled the collapse of Muscovy. Boyars have given up on the central government and contacted local generals to declare their own petty realms. As foreign powers swoop in upon the Muscovite corpse, the conclusion of nearly all observers is that Muscovy has lost any chance of unifying Russia. Time will tell if another state will take up the task but for the time being, Russia is lost once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.A;Life, a series of increasing sufferings, flies further and further towards its end—the most terrible suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.T;Muscovy Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.D;Muscovy as we knew it is no more. All of the lands which it claimed in its quest to unify Russia have broken away, steered onto new courses by ambitious boyars and generals. Perhaps we shall write the next chapter of Russia's history?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.A;Total freedom, with all the horror it entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.T;Peace Returns to Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.D;The dire prophecies of pessimists both foreign and domestic have failed to be born out, as the Muscovite ship of state once more crests the waves. Protests have begun to fade into minor complaints, the peasants have returned to their work, and the boyars have accepted the new order. Yet while collapse has been averted, the future of the nation is still unclear. Some believe that Dmitry’s best bet to ensure long-term stability is to reconcile with right-wing members of the Lyapunovs, crowning a suitably pious conservative as the new Tsar and returning to spiritual duties. Others believe that the radical cause has merely gone underground, and is in fact poised to strike at the heart of Muscovite power and seize control. Still others hold that Muscovy’s future lies in building consensus and establishing a balance of power between the estates. Finally, hardcore Orthodox Christians encourage Dmitry to maintain his position as head of state. In the end…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.A;...Prince Konstantin Lyapunov is crowned Tsar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.B;...a republican coup is executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS168.T;The Patriotic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS168.D;The Commonwealth has finally managed to overcome all political obstacles and centralize itself into a modern nation state. While this would be problematic enough for our foreign policy, they have not contented themselves with organizing their domestic politics, but have pursued an ambitious and aggressive policy abroad. This has now been taken to the most dire extreme, as the Commonwealth has declared that the “situation in Muscovy” is “no longer acceptable,” and have proclaimed their intent to “reorganize the region” through nothing less than a campaign of brutal subjugation! Already the Commonwealth’s legions are marching towards us, hellbent on shattering our nation and ending the threat of Russian unification. As the hoofbeats of their winged hussars begin to echo in the ears of our border guards, Muscovy faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS168.A;We shall fight for the future and destroy these invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.T;Victory in the Patriotic War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.D;To the joy and relief of all true Russians, the vile Commonwealth’s invasion of Muscovy has been destroyed! They fought with the strength of devils, but this was not enough to overcome the indomitable Muscovite spirit, nor the power of our valiant soldiers. This victory shall surely further our reputation as the rightful unifiers of Russia, and draw outlying states to our cause. The Commonwealth may have thought itself newly invincible but we have revealed their weakness, and soon enough, once the Russian people are united, we shall repay them - with interest. Long live Muscovy, long live free Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.A;May our light shine in glory for all Russians to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
##################### THE GIGANTIC BLOB OF NOVOGROD LOCALIZATION. GOD HELP EVERYONE. ##############################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.T;Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.D;Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.A;For Novgorod the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.T;The Uralic petition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.D;The Vyatka Republic is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs but Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws. Vyatka is a peculiar case of political integration, as Udmurt, Mari and Komi people live within its borders and enjoy a certain degree of citizenship rights. However, They are still treated as second-class citizens, despite their almost complete conversion to Orthodoxy. The Uralic people of the republic have petitioned the local Veche to abolish some long standing norms like discriminatory legislation for land ownership and military conscription. The spokesman of this group is Yevgeny Blinov, a russified Udmurt noble and patron of the first Udmurt publishing house, his wealth has attracted many Vyatkan officials to his side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.A;Vyatka will recognize the rights of its loyal citizens;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.B;This is a Slavic Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.T;Fate of the Mari Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.D;The Mari Confederation is situated in the no-man's-land between Tatary, the Novgorodian Confederation and central Russia. The Mari have fiercely fought against both Russian and Tatars, resisting attempts at conquest, colonization and conversion. There is no clear centralized administration in the area, but numerous tribe leaders have already converted to Orthodoxy and have made trade relations with Vyatkan their main source of wealth and power. When news came that Vyatka expanded the rights of the Uralic people living within its borders, including some northern Mari tribes, many chieftains wondered if they would not be better off joining Vyatka, and Novgorod as a whole or keep their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.A;Join Vyatka!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.B;Independence has served us well!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
NRUS3.C;Ask to join the Novgorodian confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

There is no clear centralized administration in the area, but numerous tribe leaders have already converted to Orthodoxy and have made trade relations with Vyatka and Novgorod their main source of wealth and power. They have asked to join our Confederation as a new free state, and we have accepted. A Novgorodian embassy will create a Veche in Yoshkar-Ola and ensure our power stretches even farther!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS4.A;Let them join!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.T;The conscription law;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.D;The news of the integration of Uralic peoples in the Vyatkan Republic has created a negative reaction in Novgorod. While Karelians and other Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows. The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax and challenge the colonial attitude some colonists harbor towards the Uralic people. The northern volosts have asked the Veche how to deal with this large minority who have heard of the new Vyatkan laws. A new conscription law is proposed as a replacement for the yasak, which would establish Komi and Nenets units as military reserves and assistants for frontier outposts and isolated garrisons. Tyko Verigin, a representative of Samoyedic origin from the volost of Arkhangelsk, also proposes to give Uralic chieftains and elders the right to join local administrative assemblies, giving them a voice in the administration of their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.A;Savages do not deserve rights;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.B;The Conscription law strikes a compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.C;Rights are granted to the Uralics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.T;News from Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.D;Our new laws of integration for the Uralic peoples have created quite a stir in Novgorod, for the Veche has reaffirmed the discriminatory laws that we abolished. While autonomous, we still bow to Lord Novgorod the Great and keeping our laws could be poorly seen in the capital. On the other hand, it would be easy enough to write a sham law that would appease the republic while keeping the rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.A;We bow to our Lord of course…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.B;Our rewriting means nothing, we assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.T;Udmurt unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.D; Our refusal to grant rights to the Uralic people have created unrest within our small republic. The Udmurts and Mari living in Vyatka have started to resent the increasing discrimination caused by the harsh rejection of Blinov's proposals and strange rumors come from their territories, talking of seditions and troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.A;They can revolt. We are stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.T;Blinov's insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.D;The Udmurts have declared independence under the guidance of Blinov! A Confederation similar to the Mari has been  formed, with a political structure based on the democratic institutions of Vyatka. At the same time, the Udmurts reject envoys from Vyatka and have started harassing Russian garrisons. Many Russians in the countryside are escaping north or west, although those living in urban centers have been granted full rights. Vyatka must rally the various garrisons and march East to avoid a complete collapse of their authority in the hinterlands. Envoys have also been sent to Novgorod to ensure we get reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.A;Pesky Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.T;News from Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.D;Worrying news has reached us from our subjects in Vyatka. The small republic is facing an insurrection launched by the Udmurt tribes, who have grown resentful of the discrimination they face in their lands. They ask us for our support in quelling the rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.A;We will march against the Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.B;It is too costly to commit troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.T;War in Udmurtia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.D;The War against the Udmurts has been raging for several weeks already, and many fear that the Vyatkans aren’t strong enough to take care of this threat on their own. Following a rowdy session in the Veche and Council of Lords, it has been decided to send several regiments to the East to end the troubles and secure our trade again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.A;The forests will burn if needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.T;Defeat in the Votyak War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.D;As the Udmurts have secured their territory and defeated the platoons sent to defeat them, the Novgorodian Republic has been forced to recognize their independence to avoid any more financial losses. The defeat in the Votyak War proves the disastrous condition of the Novgorodian army and the administrative chaos of the confederation, which couldn't resist the uprising of mere disgruntled peasants. Valuable territory has been lost and communication with the Ural territories has become more difficult, as Novgorodians envoys and merchants must circumvent Udmurt territory to avoid customs or harassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.A;What has happened to us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.T;Victory in the Votyak war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.D;The Udmurts have been vanquished and their territory has been reintegrated into the republic. The end of the Votyak War proved that Novgorod still has an army capable of ensuring control of the confederation's territory, although many still doubt the capability of its leaders in the case of an actual conflict. The exile of Yevgeny Blinov and the closure of his publishing house has radicalised the few Uralic intellectuals, which along with rogue chieftains continued to stir unrest in the region long after the end of the uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.A;Nonetheless, it’s a victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.T;Fate of Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.D;Novgorod must decide what to do with Vyatka. The Vyatkan Veche has been replaced by a military authority, people flee westward and the economy is in shambles. Routes towards Siberia move northwards outside the territory of the Republic, the Vyatka river is too dangerous to navigate and the ironworks facilities are either in Udmurt territory or are being dismantled to be rebuilt in the Urals, where now they are more profitable. Two options are proposed: Vyatka would be reorganised under a military government becoming a stronghold against the attacks coming from the Tatars and the Uralic tribes or the Vyatkan Veche would be restored as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS16.D;”I went silent as this nobleman praised the institution of serfdom and the lack of worries the serfs enjoy. ‘The serf is the happiest man in Russia’ he told me. But I thought, as they do not feel worries, they can not possess families, feel affection, happiness or grasp other moral sentiments. They possess nothing, not even their life, and thus any of the natural rights that were unearthed after centuries of despotism by our philosophers” /n /n The son of a Novgorodian merchant in the Russian quarter of Copenhagen, Leonid Vorontsov, has published in Copenhagen a fictionalised voyage diary of a trip from Nyenschantz to Vologda based on his own first visit to his motherland, describing the inhuman living conditions of the Russian serfs. His work widely translated has also started again the debate on serfdom in Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS16.A;At least this book is only sold abroad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.T;The Serfdom debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.D;Novgorod is a collection of different political entities that have different legislations, especially regarding serfdom. Some countries or regions don't have it, like Yugra or the Pomor lands. Some have normal serfdom, like Novgorod’s core territory, and some have a very conservative and harsh serfdom similar to the southern princedoms, like Galich and Beloozero. There has been no major evolution in serfdom legislation for at least fifty years, but the percentage of serfs has been steadily increasing, as is the number of escapees to free territories.The debate launched by Vorontsov’s book has led to the abolitionists clamoring for the Veche and Council of Lords to take a stance on the matter. The main problem comes from the stark opposition between the Council of the Lords that oppose any law proposal, and the leader of the Veche, the Posadnik, Konstantin Levashov who has decided to push for an harsher abolitionist stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.A;Let them debate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.T;The first draft;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.D;The Veche has debated for several days the idea of a unified Muzhikate Code that would make the laws of the city of Novgorod concerning serfdom effective throughout the entire Confederation. Widely seen as a compromise as it doesn’t abolish serfdom and even could restrict some freedoms enjoyed in the northern territories or volotsks, it has drawn the opposition of the Posadnik who wants the Muzhikate Code to be amended by restoring old laws, especially the tradition that allowed serfs to leave their masters on the day of Saint Yuri. Regardless of the amendment, the law will go to the Council of Lords, that will oppose any form of Muzhikate Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.A;The first draft it is;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.B;Draft the amendment into the Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.T;The Muzhikate Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.D;The Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche has been accepted by the Council of Lords despite its members relying on serfdom for their wealth and position. Many believe this outcome to result from popular discontent towards serfdom along with the realization by some noblemen that gradual reform is better if they hope to keep power in the long run. Nonetheless, this law, while quite minor, will better the lives of the serfs in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.A;A small step;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.T;The Levashov Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.D;To the surprise of many, the Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche and amended at the demand of the Posadnik has passed through the Council of Lords. No one really knows how the game was played, or the reasons behind it, but rumours talk about how the Posadnik would have bribed and threatened the members of the Council thanks to citizen bands loyal to him. While the law will improve the status of serfs in the confederation, this move has greatly angered the boyars and the princes of Beloozero and Galich who now begin to scheme together and fragment the Republic even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.A;A victory, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.T;Veto from the Nobles;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.D;While the Boyars of Novgorod do not possess a power as great as the Slazchta in the Commonwealth, the Council of Lords can veto proposals from the Veche. Unsurprisingly, the draft demanding better living conditions for the serfs has been refused. While crowds have gathered to voice their anger towards the boyars leaving the Yaroslavl palace, there isn’t much that can be done to revert their decision. Only one person can act: the prince, but many fear that his senility will lead to the same result or worse. The law can also be abandoned: abolitionism while an important political debate in Novgorod is not shared enough amongst the wealthy and educated to be worth basing a political career on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.A;Postpone any further debates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.B;Ask the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.T;The refusal of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.D;Simeon Yemin was already old when he was elected to be Prince of Novgorod. But as years go by, his role, already weak in the political circles of Novgorod, has become one of a symbolic figure that appears in front of crowds, presides over some ceremonies and signs the necessary papers from his seat in the Yaroslavl palace in the centre of the city. Many claim the old man is insane or senile, while the ones who are close to him say that it is a façade he has built over the years to be tranquil. No matter what the truth is, the Veche's representatives have regretted asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince refused to overrule the decision of the Lords and then shouted at the Posadnik that he had interrupted his afternoon rest. With this peculiar event, the hopes of the abolitionists have been crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.T;The Most Glorious Code!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veche’s representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince not only accepted to overrule the decision of the Lords. He promulgated the Code with the Amendment, and praised the text to be the Most Glorious Code of the Republic. The nobles heavily criticized the prince, as many saw it as another proof of his lunacy and his influenceable state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The prince agreed to overrule the decision of the Lords if the text said that the law was passed on his initiative.

NRUS25.T;A speech at the university;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.D;For the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Novgorodian University, the President of the Fur Traders Guild Artemy Trediakovsky was invited for a speech. The Fur Traders Guild has been a major philanthropic and political association involved in all kinds of cultural and economical affairs for decades. Fur trade is now only one of the many economic activities of the guild, whose main focus has become the promotion of modern industrial culture and the opening of the Republic to the West. He talked for an hour and proclaimed that the city of Novgorod was the door to the West for all of Russia and that the right path for the Republic was the "enlightening marvels along the Narva''. He condemned the "mirages of the ancient times", that only had to offer "another thousand years of toiling" for Russian peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.A;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.T;Meanwhile in the Ural...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.D;On the other side of the country, far away from the comforts of the city, the Yugrian Confederation administers the lands of the eastern frontier. A federation of Cossack hosts, monastic communes, fortified villages and barely loyal Uralic tribes. Its only role is to protect Novgorod and its trade concerns from the raids of the Siberians. What was once was a barely cultivable territory plundered by slave raids and migrating hordes has recently started to become one of the richest territories in the Union. The Ural Mountains have become a major center of extraction for metals and coal, giving every man the opportunity to become rich if he's willing enough to toil in the mines or haul the goods to the Russian river network along dangerous routes. Most of the trade, especially fur, comes from Siberian tributaries or trade routes across the Perm pass, which is administered by the Fur Guild. This has of course caused many problems for Yugran traders, who are forced to pay a large tariff despite having moved within their own territory and often rely on contraband.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.A;And the problem is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.T;The Guild concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.D;The Fur Trade Guild has formally petitioned the Veche to legislate on the transit of goods crossing the Urals, following a loss of income as Yugran traders use contraband to circumvent their monopoly. This demand has been met with surprisingly large opposition as hostile guilds, representatives of the Yugran territories and even members of the clergy have united against the backward proposal that would create further barriers within the union and concentrate even more power in the hands of a few merchants in the city of Novgorod. The Fur Guild which funds half the liberal associations of Novgorod find themselves having to rely on their political enemies to protect their lucrative monopoly. In the Veche three proposals emerge: the first law would confirm Guild privileges, expand the number of border patrols and enforce the tariff. The second law would create a competitive market for the Guilds and the Yugran traders. Finally, the "Laptev Amendment'', proposed by a representative from Arkhangelsk asks for the creation of a national Siberian Fur Trade Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.A;The Guild shall keep its privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.B;Let the free market decide!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.C;Nationalize the fur trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.T;Monopoly confirmed by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.D;The Fur Trade Guild’s proposal has reached the Council of Lords, and was passed into law. Now the Guild has received the authorization to monitor the passes of the East and keep a close eye on Siberian trade. While a great move for the urban bourgeoisie of Novgorod, the law would create resentment in the East, and would provoke years of unrest and smuggling in Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.A;Let the furs... flow?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.T;Monopoly rejected by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.D;Surprisingly the Council of Lords has rejected the Veche proposal of confirming their monopoly and privileges. Many thought that the aristocracy would support the urban bourgeois since it would benefit them in the end, but past grudges between the two groups were too strong to overcome. It has become clear to the Veche, that Guild privileges have gone too far and that the riches of the Novgorodian eastern lands are being left unsold due to useless ancient privileges. The creation of a modern trading company, as proposed by the Laptevs, which may kickstart Novgorodian economy, gains support in the assembly despite the risk of angering one of the most powerful political groups in the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.A;The status quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.B;Let us petition the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.T;The Prince does nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.D;Years have done their work on Simeon Yumin who seems hardly fit to rule anymore. When the Veche representatives reached him, the old man refused to receive them because it would interrupt his sleeping habits, and only after one aide convinced him to host them, he decided to welcome them in his quarters. His response was as harsh as his first words had been: the amendment would not receive any support from him as he respected the traditions of Novgorod. The status quo will leave a bitter stain in Novgorodian politics as the Yugrans often continue to fight against the Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.T;The Prince supports the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.D;Years have done their work on the Prince of Novgorod, but he is still involved in Novgorodian politics. Following the proposal of the Veche to create a national Siberian Fur Trade Company, the Prince would decide to pass the Laptev amendment into law. While a profitable endeavor for the Republic, this action would necessitate heavy compensation to the Fur Guild who was to be absorbed by the Company and anger the aristocracy who had been sidelined.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.A;Thank you, old man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.T;A surprising action;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.A;A great move, but was it deliberate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.T;Free trade of furs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, de facto creating a competitive market in Siberia. The move greatly angered the Fur Guild who was nonetheless compensated for the loss of privileges, and it did not change much in the Novgorodian economy as the Guild was the main entrepreneur and still dominated the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.A;A wasted opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.T;Refusal from the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, which would have created a competitive market in Siberia. The only person capable of ending this deadlock is the ailing Prince of Novgorod, but members of the Veche have expressed preference to letting the status quo endure rather than having to face his unpredictable temper. The Veche could also ask the Prince for approval of a modified and moderate version of the law which also contains parts of the original Laptev Amendment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.A;Leave the old man alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.B;Go to the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.T;The Prince follows the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.D;The prince’s involvement has resulted in the moderate version being promulgated into law. Nothing noteworthy changes in Novgorod following this legislation and the Guild and its supporters consider themselves very offended by the recent attacks. No one is happy about this arrangement, as the Guild still retains an important power in Yugra and the rest of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.A;A waste of time and money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.T;The Prince enforces status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.D;The Prince has enforced the status quo concerning the Ural passes and tariffs, angering the Yugrian traders. Moreover it has led to new expenses for border forts in the East. Nothing noteworthy changes as the independent merchants continue to struggle against the Guild which is itself angered by the attacks it suffered in the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.A;Unity in Novgorod is no simple task...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.T;The decision of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.A;A surprise, but a good one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.T;The Lords refuse the Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.D;The Veche has asked for the creation of a Siberian fur trade company, only to have the Council of Lords reject the proposal. Debates are still going though, as Aristemy Laptev gathers several witnesses and various supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.A;What will happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.T;The Semyonov testimony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.D;Aristemy Laptev has taken the opportunity brought by the ongoing debate to denounce the unlawful practices of the Fur Merchants Guild, exposing their unlawful treatment of Novgorodian citizens in the north and in Siberian lands and blaming them for the misery of these naturally rich territories. The testimony of Vasily Semyonov, a Yugrian fur trader who lost an eye following an attack by Guild agents shook the assembly to the core. In the chaos of the revelation, a group of radical representatives in the Veche has started an overall attack against Guild privileges of all kinds, asking for the abolition of many ancient rights that hamper Novgorod's ascent into modernity, or so they claim. The Veche representatives must now propose either the dissolution of all the guilds or just focus on ending the Fur Trade Guild and then pass the proposal for the Prince for approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.A;The Veche votes on the dissolution of all Guilds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.B;The Veche only targets the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.T;Dissolution of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.D;Given the guilds' sudden infamy and the discovery of serious cases of corruption, the Prince easily accepted the Veche’s proposal and the backlash was limited. Many guilds eventually resurfaced as enterprises or associations within a solidified free market. The Novgorodian system has changed for the better according to many, and has become more western-like.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.A;Guilds were an hindrance to prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.T;The Status Quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.D;The prince has refused to end the Guilds, claiming they were an important part of Novgorodian society that could not be liquidated. Intellectuals resent Novgorod's unwillingness to abandon what they consider its feudal roots and eastern trade remains the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.A;Well, nothing changed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.T;The end of the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.D;The Fur Traders Guild was dissolved by the Prince following the Semyonov testimony, but it soon resurfaced under a new guise. Trans-Uralic trade ended up still heavily regulated and Novgorod-based merchants were able to keep the largest slice of the cake, leaving the Yugrian and Pomors in relative poverty. The liquidation was thus a radical move (and expensive) but it neither changed the situation for Northerners nor shook up the traditional status quo of Novgorod's trade regulations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.A;Well, this backfired...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.T;The Prince refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.D;The Prince has refused the proposal to end the Fur Trade Guild, preserving the status quo in spite of the recent revelations. Following this action, it appeared to most people in the north and east that Novgorod had once again taken a step backward, preserving ancient institutions to keep its aristocrats happy instead of choosing the interest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.A;Is it that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.T;A new proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.D;The Prince has refused the liquidation of the Guild and chose to enforce a competition regime, starting by granting a chapter to the Laptevs to create a new Fur Trade Company with a timed monopoly on Siberian and Arctic Trade. With their practises exposed in Novgorod the Guild is forced to reform and change its stances towards the Yugrians, and even start working with the Laptves. The economy of Novgorod is booming, and eventually the fur trade system becomes the basis for new enterprises in the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.A;A happy ending!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.D;Novgorod maintained control of the lower Ob river valley (also known as Kantekia) with the support of various Khanty and Mansi tribes hostile to the Sibir Khanate. While the southern tribes were under the control of the Yugrian Confederation, tasked with the protection of the Urals from Siberian raids, the northern tribes recognised the authority of a Prince, who had direct contact with a Novgorodian military governor. The Prince of Kondia (from the name of an Ob tributary) collected the yasak from the local Khanty-Mansi tribes, including some from the Siberian wilderness. By taking advantage of a period of political distress, the Prince of Kondia has become even more politically relevant. Some tribes in the south and the east have also gathered under his protection, defying their old Tatar or Cossack masters. The Princedom of Kondia is now, de facto, a vassal state of the Novgorodian Confederation and not a mere tribal institution to collect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.A;A worrying development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.D;We are forced to give lands to the Prince of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.T;The Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.D;For a long time, the inhabitants of the Russian Far North have met and mixed with Uralic people, Southerners fleeing war and serfdom, Cossacks and Tatars searching for new homelands, sects and monks looking for isolation and many adventurers willing to risk their lives in the Arctic Sea. Thanks to this varied influx of cultures and the proximity to the sea, the "Pomors'' have distinctive traditions and customs that make them unlike any other Russian community. Most of them are Povolniks, people who are not bound by constant obligations with any guild, princedom, monastery or boyar. The main center of Pomor culture is the port of Arkhangelsk. A group of Pomor intellectuals and merchants, including representatives from communities in Scandinavian territory have recently created the Saint Michael Brotherhood to further Pomor culture, economical and political interests. The organisation creates problems in Finnmark, as its local chapters alarm Scandinavian officials who are concerned about a growing Russian presence and influence in the area, but they also generate wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.A;Restrict the movement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.B;Accept their benefits and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.T;Developments in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.D;Recent events in Novgorod have started to strain the relationship between the Volosts in the North and the capital. Unlike Vyatka or Yugra, the popular assemblies of these territories are supervised by a governor sent from the capital. The locals have created a ‘Seven Volost Assembly’ gathered in Veliky Ustyug, under the auspices of salt and iron magnate Maksim Rogovich-Strogonov. They have formed a new entity under the name ‘Permyak Federation’, taking inspiration from ancient Great Perm and acknowledging Komi-Russian intermingling. Rogovich-Strogonov's immense influence in Novgorodian politics forced the recognition of his autonomous fief, of which he was chosen as the first Posadnik. Meanwhile in the farthest north, the Volost of Pustozersk refused integration into the Permyak Federation. This region is dotted with isolated orthodox monasteries, acting as intermediaries between the Pomor merchants and the Nenets tribes. From the chapter of Pustozersk, Archimandrite Tikhon gained the prerogatives of the former governor in Zapolyarnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.A;Two new states in the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.T;The Pomor Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.D;The Pomors have reached a point of no return regarding their relationship with Veliky Novgorod. After centuries of obedience and service, the people of the Russian Far North have decided to organise into an autonomous political entity within the Novgorodian confederation. No longer shall governors and city boyars hinder the decisions of the free Pomor people. This has been a painful decision, but following the birth of numerous Pomor cultural associations and their meddling with the politics of Arkhangelsk it had become clear that Pomor separatism was gaining the upper hand in the region. Secession talks are still frowned upon, but this separation will leave an ugly scar regardless. The prince of Novgorod can decide to nominate a prince when he promulgates the Founding Charter of the new state or let the Pomors govern themselves with fully democratic institutions like Vyatka and Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.A;Nominate a prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.B;Let them rule themselves;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.T;Scandinavian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.D;Our annexation of Pskov and our refusal to part with Ingria has attracted the ire of the Scandinavians. Copenhagen sees us as a possible threat to their Baltic hegemony and has declared war on us with the intent to humiliate us and retake the coastline. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.A;We learnt from Nevsky !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.T;Utter defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.D;Not a single shot was fired in the end. Scandinavian troops walked in Karelian villages with the approval of the locals as the instability of the Republic has grown too strong. Our leaders were weak and divided and we pay the price for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.A;How could that happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.T;Victory in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.D;To the surprise of many, Novgorodians managed to fight back the Scandinavians, surprising their regiments in the cold forests of the North. The Republic was divided, but now it appears stronger than before, with the leaders of the Republic joining together for the cause. The victory of Novgorod has been deemed the new David and Goliath fight in Russia, and many patriots rejoice throughout the land for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.A;A glorious event !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.T;Defeat in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.D;Karelia was soon taken by the Scandinavians as our Republic could not manage to muster its forces efficiently against this stronger enemy. The divisions between our leaders have hampered our war effort and many people have grown disillusioned at the state of the Republic, especially the Pomors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.A;It’s just snow and trees though;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.T;The War for what ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.D;Karelia didn’t just matter to much people in Novgorod. After the various crises of the previous years, the question of holding on or not onto Karelia didn’t matter for many. Ultimately the Kremlin did not really care much than the rest of the population about deserted Pomor territory and was not willing to make it a national affair after the rough experiences of the previous years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.A;Why die for Karelia indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.T;The Glorious victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.D;Karelia may be empty land without a lot of interest but the war was seen as many as the last piece towards the rebirth of the united Republic. Soldiers fought for the unity of the nation and leaders temporalily set aside their grudges for the good of Novgorod. This ensured a victory against the master of the Baltic sea and one of the great colonial empires of Europe. Now is the time for celebration and the continued reconstruction of our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.A;Long live our Lord Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.T;Revanchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.D;The war for Karelia had mobilized every soul and body in the nation but it was not enough in the end. But as Karelia was lost, our national consciousness still endures stronger than ever. People are already enlisting and preparing for the revenge and reconquest of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.A;We’ll get them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.T;The massacre of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.D;Scandinavian victory was the natural result in their war against Novgorod. The armies of the Republic could not stand and defend the lands they had stolen from Scandinavia. Eventually Scandinavians breached the city walls and secured the Kremlin. As they intended to place another puppet Prince a bomb exploded and killed several men of a Norwegian regiment. In retaliation, the troops set the city ablaze, looting and killing on sight. Novgorod ended on this day, as the various states east declared independence and refused to let Scandinavians into their country. Copenhagen settled on influencing the rump states of Novgorod and the Pomors, securing their hold in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.A;What an horrible fate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.T;The miracle on the Neva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.D;Many thought that Novgorod would be forced to submit to Scandinavia after having annexed the Republic of Pskov. But the forces of the fledging Republic managed to fight back the foreign troops and securing their hold on the Baltic. Now is a time of celebrations in the Republic, as Scandinavia has also been forced to pay heavy reparations and admit the independence of Lord Novgorod the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.A;The world turned upside down !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.T;The defeat of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.D;The attempt by Novgorodians to challenge the status quo and take back the Republic of Pskov ended in defeat as Scandinavians managed to get back their territories and occupied large swaths of land in Novgorod proper. The Novgorodian prince was forced to go to Copenhagen to sign an humiliating treaty. Pskov was to be taken back by Scandinavia and the Republic would pay an enormous war reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.A;A shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.T;Scandinavian defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.D;The Second Neva War has ended in victory for Novgorod which managed to take back its Baltic Coast and force Scandinavia to recognize its independence. In addition, heavy war reparations were paid in exchange for the numerous Scandinavian prisoners trapped during the winter campaign and the end of occupation of the Baltic and Finnish lands of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.A;A glorious future for Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.T;Victory for Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.D;Scandinavia fought an hard war in Novgorod as militias from the whole Confederation flocked to the Baltic coast to defend their land. Even after countless victories on the battlefields, the spirit of Novgorod was never broken. When they entered the city Kremlin, the officials had fled to the countryside and led a guerrilla war. Eventually peace was signed with heavy reparations, but Novgorod endures as a strong country in Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.A;Peace without victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.T;Victory of Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.D;The Second Neva War had triggered a national awakening in the Republic as the people came together to fight the oppressors. Militias from the whole Confederation held on the Baltic fortresses and forced the Scandinavian armies to flee from their country. Huge crowds have gathered in the capital to celebrate the victory and public enemies like the Posadnik Levashov and the Prince of Galich Matveyev were seen together with the Prince to announce a reorganization of the Republic with a new Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.A;Long live Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.T;The Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.D;The Millennial Charter has been signed by representatives from the whole Republic, giving Novgorod a new written constitution following the national cohesion created by the war. The confederate nature of the republic is formally preserved, but the reorganisation de facto creates a federal system with a strong central authority under the helm of the Veche. Powers of the Prince and Lords have been reduced, while serfdom is gradually abolished throughout the land, although compensation for former owners are very expensive. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.A;A new millennium for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.T;Treaty of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.D;Our aim was to take back the whole Republic of Pskov, but the war took such a huge toll on our forces that many think it would be best to just limit ourselves to the Baltic coast as to not trigger another war in the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.A;We will be merciful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.B;We won didn’t we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.D;After a long and disastrous reign, Simeon Yumin, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died. Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation.\n\nThe Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached Novgorod yet. Dimitriy Matveyev, the Prince of Galich, and one of the most reactionary figures in the feudal faction, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.A;These are troublesome times;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.T;The Siege of the Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.D;After weeks of deadlock, the Prince of Galich has decided with the support of the military to take power. While the plot was largely successful as the troops took control of most of the city, the liberals and progressives barricaded themselves in the city Kremlin. Among them, Konstantin Levashov, the Posadnik and leader of the progressive faction, awaits the arrival of the Northerners and Siberians while hiding in the city Kremlin. The siege begins, with the Kremlin completely cut off by the troops of the feudal faction. Eventually, the Prince of Galich offers a final deal to the besieged: exile or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.A;Exile is best for the city...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.B;The Posadnik holds on;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.T;Death of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.D;Following the ultimatum from the Prince of Galich, the Posadnik Levashov convened with his followers gathered in the Kremlin and decided to accept exile. A white flag was hoisted from the walls, as the defenders walked out and passed before the infamous Prince of Galich who still kept true to his word and let them go without molestation. With the siege of the Kremlin ending and the exile of his opponents, the Prince is free to reorganize Novgorod as he sees fit. All pseudo-democratic institutions were reduced to mere formalities while the title of Prince was formally given to the Metropolitan. But all effective power has been transferred to a Committee of Ministers led by the Prince of Galich. Meanwhile the authority of Novgorod has crumbled in the North and East, as the Pomors and Uralics refuse to accept the new state of affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.A;Novgorod lives…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.T;The shelling of the Novgorod Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.D;The besieged liberals have refused the ultimatum of their opponents, prompting the shelling and destruction of the city Kremlin. The last pockets of resistance in the ruins were then cleared by the bayonet, with the corpse of the leader of the Veche, Konstantin Levashov found in the ruins. The oldest city of Russia is forever scarred and the whole Slavic world looks at those responsible for this tragedy with shame. The title of Prince, which prompted the whole affair, remains vacant as one by one domestic and foreign candidates refuse the blood-stained crown, leaving the feudal faction in disarray. The Novgorod confederation ends, as everyone thinks for themselves. The Princes return to their fiefs, preparing to deal with the incoming rebellion while the military command establishes a provisional administrative assembly and de facto takes control of the Novgorod region. Garrisons around the country are emptied as many defect or are called to the central territories to safeguard what remains of the city and its neighbourhoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.A;A sad end for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.T;Fate of the peripheries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.D;The throne of Novgorod is vacant, after a millenium of greatness, the city of Rurik barely controls the surrounding countryside. Novgorod has become a military dictatorship and the confederation has been dissolved. The Siberian delegates reach the city as it resembles more of a military barracks than the old capital. Their assembly no longer exists, the periphery has been abandoned. The shockwave of the collapse makes local institutions unstable, opening the path for commanders and conspirators to take the reins of the states left unguarded. The local Novgorodian garrisons can take control instead of retreating to the capital, or local boyars and noble with the support of the military can dissolve the democratic institutions, or simply informs them of the trying future that awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.A;Commanders take control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.B;A Prince is proclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.C;We will endure as a Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.D;The Prince of Novgorod has died, leaving behind a country more divided than ever. The boyars in the Council of Lords and the representatives of the Veche are unable to compromise on a candidate. In the baroque halls of the grandiose Yaroslav's Palace, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, a fight erupts among the delegates. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev of Galich accuses Posadnik Konstantiv Levashov of seeking absolute power for himself through populism and the bending of all institutional rules. The Posadnik replies by attacking the backwardness of the princes, whose hatred for progress in all fields is bringing the great republic down to the levels of its southern neighbours. In a final gesture of goodwill, all factions agree to convene for the first time in more than two centuries a Bishop's Veche, near the Holy Wisdom Cathedral at the centre of the Kremlin. The Metropolitan asks for a week of solitude and prayer before making his decision, hoping to find spiritual guidance through the Znameniye icon that saved the city multiple times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.A;Let the Holy Wisdom enlighten him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.T;Choice of the Metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.D;In the old times, the Metropolitan of Novgorod had been a leading political figure in the Republic, especially when weak princes came and went. With the decline of Unitarianism and the rationalisation of traditional political institutions, the religious head lost most of its influence, while remaining a respected national unifying figure even for Orthodox citizens. The old Metropolitan Dmitry, confirmed by Rome and Tver merely three years prior, had little experience with the city's politics, preferring the ascetic lifestyle of the city's numerous monasteries, yet he had no choice but to bear on his shoulders the confederation's future. He ponders his options: Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, a prominent and devout nobleman has the support of the aristocracy. Meanwhile, he could say he found no figure and propose a vote of the unified Veche. Or he could propose a vacancy of the office, leaving four years for the oppositions to die down. As he emerges from the Cathedral before the Veche he finally proposes.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.A;The Metropolitan proposes Chemiakin-Belsky for the Prince office;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.B;Count the votes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.C;The Metropolitan proposes to elect no Prince for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.T;The Cathedral explosion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.D;The Metropolitan announced his support for the feudal faction's candidate, Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, an affluent landowner from a minor branch of the Yaroslavl's Belsky known for his zealous patronage of church-building projects and traditional values. This decision infuriated the anti-feudal faction and made the delegates from Siberia and the North particularly uneasy given the Prince's zealotry. Right before the enthronement ceremony, boycotted by the opponents, a powerful explosion devastates the entrance of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, killing 24 participants including the Metropolitan. Vyacheslav survives, miraculously unscathed, and immediately blames his opponents. The Veche is dissolved via ukase while the ‘plotters’ are sentenced to capital punishment in absentia. In Staraya Russa, on the other side of the Ilmen Lake, the surviving members of the Veche pledge their loyalty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", a metaphorical way to refer to the City, refusing to swear fealty to a Prince. The two sides gear up for war to restore the "Republic".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.A;We follow the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.B;We follow Lord Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.T;Change of alliances;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.D;Following the coup in Novgorod, we have chosen to side with the Republican forces in Pomoria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS72.A;For the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.D;The division between the feudal and anti-feudal factions have grown too much to amend without bloodshed. Now is the time to reunify Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS73.A;For the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.D;Prince Vyacheslav Novgorodsky, as he has been renamed, has won over his opponents, unifying Novgorod under his strong hand. Novgorod has become a princedom not very much different from his southern neighbours, especially Yaroslavl, and it seems that the ambitions of the Northern State will not stop at just unifying Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.A;Long live Vyacheslav!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.T;Restoration of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.D;Prince Vyacheslav has been defeated along with his allies by the free forces of the North and the East. The old republic is restored, with a sympathetic nobleman proclaimed as the new prince by the restored Veche. The Council of Lords has been curtailed however and the old princedoms of the Confederation have been annexed directly in retaliation for their actions. Novgorod is far from being truly united as the control over the East and North is not assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.A;Long live the restored Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.T;Change of allegiance;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.D;We are now a puppet of Novgorod as before;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS76.A;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.T;The Peace of Cherepovets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.D;The war has ended without a true victor. Novgorod is now reduced to the original city and the old feudal princes, while its former subjects in the East and North have become independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.A;An end to the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.T;The Bakers Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.D;After the Metropolitan categorically refused to assume the title of Prince or a new ad hoc equivalent, voting resumed. But the conflict amidst factions grew so violent that the bishop's Veche had to be dissolved and the Kremlin vacated with military intervention. Street fighting ensued between the City's Guard and supporters of the opposed factions. After a week of attempted restoration of control, rumours of incoming military columns from Beloozero and the South started spreading. Supporters of the feudal faction had already escaped the city when an anti-boyar pogrom ravaged the city. Posadnik Konstantin Levashov organised a makeshift "Five Kontsy Council'' to replace the de facto defunct Council of Lords and Veche. The "Bakers’ Coup'', as it was contemptuously called in the princedoms, marked the end of the "Old Republic". The reactionary states of the Confederation joined forces with a large section of the military command to restore order in Novgorod at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.A;The Republic must put down the princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.B;The Prince of Beloozero will safeguard our traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.T;The Novgorodian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.D;After weeks of pointless negotiation and preparation on both sides, Levashov formally declared the Princedom of Beloozero and Galich enemies of the confederation and prepared to end their continued independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.A;For the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.T;Victory of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.D;Beloozero has fallen and the republic has been preserved. Levashov nonetheless refused to disband his puppet Five Kontsy Council and has proposed the creation of a "Chamber of the Pyatinas" as a parallel assembly. The Council would legislate on Novgorod's surroundings, while the Chamber would deal with matters regarding the periphery. The Posadnik would remain a leading figure in both institutions, as they are filled with his own yes-men, but the states' autonomy would be respected, at least formally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.A;Our Posadnik knows the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.T;Posadnik’s choice;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.D;We accepted Levashov’s power grab because of the threat the feudal lords have portrayed, but now that Beloozero and Galich are vanquished, it seems that he will not be content with the way the republic worked. He has sent a message to all the members of the confederation to join the ‘Chamber of Pyatinas’ and to be integrated more closely into the republic. But at the same time, the old institutions that guaranteed our rights and a form of democracy have been side-lined, so we could refuse this new arrangement and go our own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.A;We follow the Posadnik...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.B;We won’t accept tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.T;The "New Confederation Charter";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.D;With the old confederation integrated and under the power of Levashov, the Posadnik has promulgated the New Confederation Charter that acts as the new Constitution of the republic. The powers of the Posadnik are near absolute, as he rules for life and can appoint at will the members of the various assemblies. At least Novgorod knows order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.A;Long live the Posadnik-for-life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.T;Reorganization of Novogorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.D;The Five Kontsy Council that led the city since the riots that followed the Bishop’s Veche has been vanquished by the princes and members of the military. Novgorod is pacified as the would-be Dictator Levashov lies hanged like a peasant inside the Kremlin. The city suffered another scarring event with a terrible repression, but order is now reinforced. A puppet noble, Roman Medvedev, has been selected as the prince of Novgorod, and the old institutions have been reformed to concentrate all real power in the Council of Lords, the true political body of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.A;Long live the aristocrats!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.T;Annexation of Beloozero;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.D;Fulfilling its political goals, Beloozero is ready to rejoin Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.T;End of the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.D;As the war dragged on, the free states blamed Levashov for having destroyed the confederation and the loss of liberties and rights they suffered. The East and North thus left, while the southern princes were also unable to defeat the Posadnik. His powerbase in Novgorod has been consolidated and he tightened his grip on the city and its surroundings. The Novgorod Republic now only exists on paper and the new Novgorodian state forged by the "New Rurik" is a completely new entity where power rests only in the hands of the Posadnik who rules for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.A;A sad end for Novgorod...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.T;The Metropolitan prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.D;The last vacancy of the Novgorodian throne dated back to two centuries earlier and it coincided with partial Scandinavian occupation, leading some to think that the confederation had effectively entered its final days. Postponing the election of the Prince requires a supermajority in the joint assembly of the Veche and the Council of Lords. The feudal faction demands to vote for a new prince, knowing well that a vacancy would mean greatly expanding the prerogatives of Posadnik Konstantin Levashov. As the assembly nearly ends up in riot, the Metropolitan decides to take a decisive step to avoid the dissolution of the confederation. Against his wishes, he accepts the nomination as Prince. The feudal faction reluctantly accepts the compromise, hoping to be advantaged by a conservative leader. But the Metropolitan is politically incompetent and his desire to stay neutral leads to absolute prominence of the Posadnik. Only a few weeks after the election, the Council of Lords is dissolved by decree of the Veche, prompting division in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.A;An unexpected development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.D;The dissolution of the Council of Lords by the Veche has alarmed the southern princes, who fear that the new regime will restrict their privileges. The Posadnik Levashov has thus decided to declare war to restore order in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.A;Destroy the Princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.T;Victory of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.D;The Republic of Novgorod has vanquished the reactionaries of the southern princedoms, securing the role of the Veche and other democratic institutions. The first act of the reunified Republic was the long-awaited abolition of serfdom. But even victorious, the Republic has already fallen again in various political disputes, and it seems there is no grand vision of its future and its role amongst the various eastern Slavic states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.A;A victory nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.T;Feudal victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.D;As the Prince of Beloozero and Galich managed to win against the new Novgorod Republic, the confederation has reverted back to its old state: Levashov has fled abroad as armies marched to the city and the Veche has been purged, while old institutions like the Council were reinstated. The Metropolitan abdicated as the prince and the winners of the war chose Roman Medvedev, a weak nobleman as the new prince. The confederation appears frozen in its old derelict state, and it will not have the strength to rescind the rights of its constituent states, should a threat appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.A;A new situation in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.T;Failure of the republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.D;The white peace between the princes and the republic was seen as a shameful stain on the republic. Convinced that the urban bourgeoisie could not lead the republic to a strong future the various members of the confederation chose to leave and take their fate into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.A;The end of a political legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.T;Death of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.D;The death of the Prince of Novgorod closed a troubled parenthesis in the history of the Novgorodian Confederation. Veliky Novgorod, the Russian gate to the west, represented the tensions between two seemingly irreconcilable societies: a city of world-travelling merchants, sublime poets and Croesus-like lords living and voting side by side with the wretched of the Russian lands, the faceless human machines in the new factories or the wandering souls of the rural estates and arctic villages. Many Panrussian intellectuals thus look at Novgorod as the most desirable candidate for the unification of the Slavs. During the joint meeting of the Council of Lords and the Veche to nominate the new prince, many wanted to seize the opportunity to settle old feuds, notably the Posadnik Levashov. But in the end, his candidate, the weak Roman Medvedev, was soundly defeated by the Livonian noble Pyotr Gustavovich Litke, the first non-boyar elected to the office. Originally from Dorpat, he had made himself known in Novgorod for his anti-Scandinavian rhetoric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.A;Long live Pyotr Gustavovich!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.T;The nomination of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.D;The first obstacle to the rule of Prince Pyotr Litke was the cohabitation with his insubordinate Posadnik Levashov. Gathering allies in the Veche, Pyotr Litke helped the Prince of Galich and Levashov's main opponent Ivan Anisimov strike him down. Konstantin Levashov thus lost his title of Posadnik a few days after the election, but retained his seat in the Veche. The Prince now has the power to influence the selection of the next Posadnik, but he knows well that he must play divide et impera. Having been elected for his strong will and his distance from any major boyar clan, his role was to remove Levashov and restart the political rotation of the office between the factions. Litke has ambitions of his own and he knows that his supposed allies have little esteem of him, but at the same time he knows that to build his rule he needs solid foundations. The prince can either come to terms with Levashov and allow the election of Anisimov as Posadnik or let the ex-Posadnik and the Cossack smear each other freely in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.A;The Prince brokers a deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.B;The Prince stays out of it;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.T;Anisimov elected Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.D;After a series of meetings between the candidates and the Prince, the Veche elects Ivan Anisimov as the new Posadnik. The session was surprisingly calm given how Levashov's supporters had insinuated until merely days prior that Anisimov was a co-conspirator of a "reactionary coup". Many saw this event as a sign of the Prince's effective mediation skills and Levashov's acceptance of his downfall. But two weeks after the election, Levashov's political stances had completely reversed, bringing him back in the spotlight. He claimed that Anisimov’s “extremist and incapable" government was bringing the country on the brink of collapse and that only the guidance of the prince could bring Novgorod back on the right track. Even if Anisimov had only ruled for a dozen days, he had already attracted resentment from nearly all Novgorodian society for he was ambitious and idealistic, but far from capable. Once again, Pyotr Litke moved behind the scenes to broker a deal between two former archenemies: Konstantin Levashov and the prince of Galich Dimitriy Matveyev.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.A;What does the prince choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.T;The curtailing of the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.D;In a surprising turn of events, Prince Pyotr Litke openly addressed the Veche about the government of Posadnik Anisimov, deeming it "divisive" and "misguided". With the compliance of the reactionaries brought by Matveyev, Levashov's cronies and the disillusioned former supporters of Anisimov, the prince has bent centuries old rules with a simple speech. Not only had he curtailed the Posadnik as the most influential figure in the state, he had also greatly reduced the prominence of the Veche. With the Veche under control and Anisimov removed from power, the new Triumvirate of Litke, Levashov and Matveyev affirmed the control over the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.A;Long live the new Princedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.T;The Novgorodian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.D;Following his speech in the Veche, the prince gathered his allies to work on a constitution. Levashov and Matveyev old distrust and enmity was soon soothed by the diplomatic attitude of the prince. The three men agreed that Novgorod’s institutions were to be renovated. The prince would gain accrued power establishing a Western cabinet for affairs of state and becoming an hereditary office. In exchange for these concessions, the old Veche and Council of Lords would still exert power. Levashov obtained the minister of finances while Matveyev was chosen as prime minister with the support of both chambers, unifying the confederation once and for all under the rule of the prince and his two trusted advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.A;Long live the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.T;Political deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.D;Despite his actions, Litke was not able to find a common ground between Levashov and Matveyev, leading to a political deadlock. But the prince knew that he hadn't yet moved all his pieces. With the paralysis of government activities due to the political crisis many were starting to fear an action of force to restore order. The Novgorod garrison stands on alert, the prince of Galich has retreated to his estate while Levashov preaches to the mutinous capital about the sacredness of the ancient laws of Novgorod. The choice of the prince is now pivotal: will he ask the garrison to enforce order in the capital or leave the Kremlin and address the people to reassure them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.A;Gun the rioters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.B;There is no problem here;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.T;The military steps in;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.D;The outrageous order of the prince shocked the garrison, which was preparing for attacks from outside the city, leading to a general mutiny. Levashov made a last attempt to save his face and distance himself from the prince, but his position was too compromised. Both the prince and the former Posadnik were brought under arrest by none other than Ivan Anisimov and his Cossack guards. The war hero and popular leader Anisimov, rivalled only by his defeated nemesis Levashov, had discarded the mask of democratic kindness, choosing his favourite recipe to restore order and peace: with military discipline and ruthless action. While the two "conspirators" were allowed to rot into the prisons of the Kremlin, Prince Matveyev was not so lucky as even before he could reach his estate and prepare to march on Novgorod, he was gunned down by one of Anisimov's best men. The whole Novgorodian Republic was now ruled the same way it controlled the northern wastes: living in fear in the shadow of the barracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.A;Novgorod will know order;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.T;The Novgorodian autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.D;The prince found the crowd already energised by Konstantin Levashov. After reassuring them that there was no incoming army, Prince Pyotr Litke started attacking the Posadnik and his government for letting the situation slip out of their hands. Seizing the moment, he announced the dissolution of the government by decree and the creation of a princely council to restore peace and the "normal functions of the Council of Lords and the Veche", which were meant to convene right after the speech. By having the consensus of the masses and the army, the Prince muted all opposition and had opponents quietly sent in prison or to the firing squad. The survivors, including Matveyev and Anisimov, bowed to the Prince a few days later in the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, where he proclaimed a new "Act for Perpetual Peace" which de facto gave him total control over all aspects of government. The Republic died, as Litke assumed autocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.A;The end of our traditions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.T;Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.D;After days of inconclusive debate, the Veche is unable to elect a new Posadnik, as no compromise can be found between the conservatives, Levashov's faction and Anisimov's supporters. Government activity is paralysed and fights erupt in the streets between the various factions. With a dike left unwatched because of the unrest, a major flood devastates the eastern part of the capital, including Yaroslavl's Palace and the offices of the Posadnik. The lower class neighbourhoods take this as a sign and rise in open rebellion. The allegiance of the military is not clear and there are rumours of a general mutiny or a coup. The Prince is forced to lock down in the Kremlin, cut off from the outside world due to the incessant guerilla warfare around the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.A;This is madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.T;Unrest continues;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.D;The Prince still hides in the Kremlin, as the riot continues to engulf the city. The Citizen Guard formed by Levashov and the Cossacks of Anisimov rallied all men of good conditions, and restored order to the city. Now the prince must either turn towards Levashov, or heed the advice of Matyevev who has sent him a letter about restoring ‘order at all costs’.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.A;Accept Levashov’s call;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.B;Order at all costs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.T;Rule of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.D;Thanks to the last minute collaboration between Levashov and Anisimov, the rebels were pushed towards the devastated riverside where they had no choice but to surrender or fight to the death among the rubble. Sadly Anisimov was shot during the street fighting, leaving only the former Posadnik at the top to once again prove to be a godsend for his people. For a few months, Levashov continued to govern with emergency decrees while the two chambers remained inactive and the Prince and the Metropolitan were safely secluded to avoid undue interference with the business of government. When the situation came back to normal, nothing had formally changed in the structure of government, but it had become obvious that the confederation was now ruled by one man only with his clique of cronies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.A;Levashov played everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.T;Matveyev’s intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.D;The general uprising comes to a sudden end as news of an incoming military column starts to spread. The provisional Council of the Five Kontsy, assembled by Posadnik Anisimov with the last minute support of Levashov (tragically deceased after an ambush), had almost completed the pacification of the city with the help of the garrison's loyalist faction, when from Ilmen Lake came the troops of the prince of Galich. From the ruins of Yaroslavl's Court, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, he ordered Anisimov to surrender the city claiming to have been summoned by the prince to restore order. The exhausted citizen's guard had retreated north, preparing for urban warfare, with no intention to surrender. The garrison remains neutral, awaiting orders from the prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.A;Litke supports Matveyev;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.B;Litke contacts Anisimov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.T;The tale of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.D;The prince of Novgorod emerged from the Kremlin, confirming his support for Matveyev's actions and ordered the immediate disarmament of the "rebel militias". Meeting on the New Bridge, which had miraculously withstood the flood, the two princes organised the next political and military moves to ensure the pacification of the city and the restoration of order throughout the confederation. Their demise, however, unfolded before their eyes as Matveyev's regiment fell into Anisimov's trap. The two princes then tried to retreat to the Kremlin, only to find that the garrison had defected to the Posadnik, after Matveyev army’s terror tactics. The Battle on the New Bridge between Anisimov's Cossacks, the citizen's guard, and the garrison and the remnants of Matveyev's expedition force ended with a bloodbath and the summary execution of the two Princes. Hailed as a hero and the savior of the Republic, Anisimov declared the princedoms dissolved and in the following months proceeded to call the elections for a new Constituent Assembly to write a constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.A;Long live the hero of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.T;One Prince leaves, the other hides;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.D;After coordinating in secret with Posadnik Anisimov, the prince emerged once again to address the city, asking for relentless resistance against the coup of the Prince of Galich. Matveyev, caught by surprise, attempted to retreat away from the city, going as far as abandoning his troops to escape dressed as a monk, but the horrible conditions of the terrain and the swift action of the garrison stopped them on their tracks. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev was brought back to Veliky Novgorod, where he was publicly executed on the grounds of the Kremlin. Prince Pyotr Litke declared the dissolution of the princedoms and proclaimed the forging of a "New Union" on the ashes of the old one. With Anisimov's trusted men enforcing the Prince's will across the confederation, the city starts recovering from the recent devastation while a new Yaroslavl Court is being built to host the reformed Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.A;Long live Litke and Anisimov!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.T;The death of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.D;The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod, a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod.It has become clear to all, from the richest boyar to the most austere pomor, that the difficult and often tragic events of the last few decades have radically changed the structure of Novgorodian society who needs a new strong constitution. During the first phases of the election process for the new prince, the Russo-Livonian magnate Peter Casimir von Lütke was shot dead after accepting the candidature proposed by the conservative caucus of the two chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.A;Can Novgorod catch a break?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.T;The fall of Levashov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.D;The assassin of the soon-to-be-prince had disappeared in the shroud of the night, but he was suspected to be a petty criminal hired from the slums. The crisis paralysed the works of the assembly, as the moderates accused Posadnik Levashov of having stirred unrest in lower class neighbourhoods to start a revolt and seize power. Despite his vehement counter-accusation, this was the final nail in the coffin of Levashov's declining political career, leading to his hasty discharge. His emergency replacement was Prince Dimitriy Matveyev, assuming executive power not as Posadnik but as leader of the Council of Lords. Under common accord with the vast majority of the Veche and the Council of Lords, with the exception of few reactionary elements and die-hard supporters of Levashov, it was decided to reconvene the joint assembly in two months to write a new constitution, while a Transitional Council assumed temporary control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.A;Unusual but necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.T;The National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.D;After weeks of political deliberation throughout the city, the new Constituent Assembly presided by the prince of Galich was convened with members from the Veche and the Council of Lords. Within a few weeks of complicated negotiations, reformulation of ancient practices and innovative codification, the new constitution was ready and can only be described as...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.A;Populist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.B;Monarchic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.T;The new Popular Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.D;Despite the strong opposition of the most conservatives, it had become clear that the traditional prerogatives of the prince were an undue interference in the management of the affairs of the representatives of the Novgorodian people (with different ways based on class and census, of course). The head of state would become a symbol of national unity, as well as a moral and spiritual guide, overseeing the respect of the constitution from above the political games. Following the categorical refusal of Matveyev, it was decided as a compromise that the Metropolitan of Novgorod would always have this role, despite the timid opposition of the current office holder who was nearly forced to accept his new role. Despite this peculiar position, Novgorod grows closer to become a democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.T;The new Kingdom of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.D;The centuries old traditions have been preserved by the Assembly without sacrificing the progress made in the last decades. The new constitution has however disgruntled many progressives, who see the compromise as a grungy attempt to preserve the old power relations without bringing any real improvement to Novgorod's politics, and leaving the people without a real voice. The election of the prince has been preserved, but the powers of the office have been greatly diminished, having become redundant after the rationalisation of the relationship between the two chambers by the Constitution. Roman Medvedev has been chosen as Prince thanks to his bipartisan popularity and as a sign of compromise with the former supporters of Levashov, which had been his main political sponsor. He then unveiled the new Constitution of the Kingdom of Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.A;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.T;Preparing the Millenium of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.D;As our state prepares to celebrate the Millenium of Novgorod the Great, many projects have been gathered by city officials. The less ambitious is the construction of new boulevards in the Eastern parts of the city which would intersect in front of a Bronze statue of Riourik. A renowned Anglois architect, Philippe Billaud has also proposed to destroy the old fortifications and build a new modern and planned European city. But the most ambitious and also costly project is the work of the so called 'Novgorodian school' of architecture that wants to reinvent the whole city. The Council of State must now decide between these three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.A;The Statue is fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.B;Hire Billaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.C;Let the young Novgorodians have free rein!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

decree_to_abolish_samurai_desc;As Japan enters the modern age, the samurai stand out as anachronistic. A feudal warrior class is not what the Japan of the future needs, and the time has come to eliminate them. This will be done peacefully through levying taxes onto their government stipends and converting said stipends into government bonds, along with replacing samurai as battlefield commanders with a professional and fully meritocratic officer corps. Though former samurai families may adopt the title of shizoku, or "warrior family," to preserve some of their honor and prestige, the samurai as a martial class will soon be but a memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Not only are they a backwards remnant of the old Japan, but their status as hereditary warriors loyal not directly to the state but to the daimyo, or even, in the case of ronin, to nobody, places the government and its citizens under constant threat of intimidation or revolt. They have even displayed a disturbing tendency to support political ideologies, particularly reactionary and traditionalist schools of thought which are anathema to our own ideas.

weaken_guild_privileges_desc;The guilds' monopoly on nearly all aspects of trade and production are enfeebling our economy and chaining us down with obsolete methods and ideas. While we are not yet in a position to abolish them entirely, we can establish a set of restrictions on their operations, while also expanding the rights of merchants and generally promoting free trade as an economic practice. Taken together, these measures will undermine the guilds' dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

abolish_imperial_guilds_desc;The kabunakama, or imperial guilds, are a parasite upon the Japanese economy, shackling us to medieval conceptions of production and distribution. A modern Japan cannot have such a backwards financial system. We will issue an order immediately dissolving all guilds and seizing their assets, before splitting these assets up and selling them off to independent merchants piece by piece to prevent any one merchant from gaining too much. This will breathe new life into our economy and end guild monopolies at a stroke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

JAP_kill_the_cult_desc;The establishment of an extreme Shintoist movement emphasising absolute religious purity, fanatical hostility to all other faiths, and most of all the Emperor being a living kami and ruling through absolute and divine right, has been a disaster for Japan. This cult, spread by the infernal Ministry of Divinity, has perverted our ancient traditions and caused no end of suffering, not to mention emboldening cultists to fight on even after their "divine" sovereign was deposed. We must undertake a dedicated police and propaganda effort to both wipe out the cult's remaining practitioners and de-legitimize the cult's ideology and theology among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_title;Embrace Full Secularization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_desc;The pursuit of egalitarianism and the emancipation from outdated ideas has spread the notion of freedom of religion throughout our nation. While unthinkable mere decades ago, today Japan is accepting its status as a land of multiple faiths. Shintoism, Buddhism, Catholic and Protestant Christianity, even the shamanism of peoples like the Ainu, and many subdivisions within these religions, all exist within our nation. In light of this, it is absurd for our government to lift any one faith above the others as a matter of policy. Formal state support for any religious faith, institution, or organization shall be terminated and henceforth banned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Sunrise Period. Although it was not the only such "mission", being heavily inspired by the earlier Fukuzawa Mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of strained relations with the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch-Burgundian missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck years after the conclusion of the Fukuzawa Mission ordered by Prince Regent Mitsuhito. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To cultivate Japanese diplomatic ties with the Great Powers and the West in general, and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_rescript_title;The National Rescript on Education;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imperial_rescript_desc;During the Sunrise Period, the leadership of the Japanese government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centred on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality. However, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for a "state-centred" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Japan's head of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

imperial_japanese_navy_title;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled "Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion” asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan's primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy. After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.T;A New Shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.D;Last year, Tenno (Emperor) Komei was crippled in a failed assassination attempt, and is now confined to his bed and rarely conscious. Unfortunately, the Tenno is only in his fifties and he is likely to live for decades more. Abdication has almost never occured in Japan, and even if that was an option, his heir is a one-year-old baby. Thus Prince Mitsuhito, Komei’s brother, has assumed the position of Sessho-no-miya, or Prince Regent. Mitsuhito was already the Daiko-Daijin, or Great Chancellor, of the Daijo-Kan, or Great Council, of the Imperial Court. The Great Council was reformed following the Imperial merger with the bakufu, but Mitsuhito seems intent on using it to claim even more power. Mitsuhito has gained rapid support among Japanese traditionalists-who seek to defend the “kokutai,” a complex phrase describing Japan’s national and cultural sovereignty-and has even begun to be referred to by his reformist and moderate opponents as a Neo-Shogun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP2.T;Return of Admiral Yusumoto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.D;A retainer of the Date clan, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki is deeply connected to Japan’s colonial endeavors in northwestern Arcadia. A strong proponent of the Hokkaiganese fur trade and a specialist in amphibious warfare, Yusumoto was the only surviving admiral of the Xiazhou Expedition, the ill-fated attempt to conquer Qingqiu. Owing to his familiarity with the region, Yusumoto volunteered to lead a team of Japanese marines to disable Qingqiuan naval defenses, but despite his heroic efforts, the marines under his command were encircled and destroyed. For this he faced exile and began travelling throughout the New World and Europe. He has written much during these travels, and these writings have finally been published after his return to Japan as the Travel Commentaries of Yusumoto Hideki. While a fascinating picture of the ways of other nations, the book also contains Yusumoto’s ruminations on the failure of Xiazhou, his arguments and suggestions for reforming the military, and some rather liberal statements on egalitarianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.A;"The national military must never be hostile to reason.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.T;The Military Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.D;Yusumoto's return to Japan and the publication of his Travel Commentaries has ignited a firestorm of controversy, all centered around the military. The reformists argue that it was Western aid which tipped the scales in Qingqiu’s favor, and thus Japan should adopt Western tactics and weapons. Most daimyos sympathize with Yusumoto and support some military reforms to avoid another Xiazhou catastrophe. Traditionalists support the proposal of the tozama or “outside” daimyo, a group of nobles who were the last to submit to Nobunaga, who have proposed to allow samurai status to be earned through victory on the battlefield, while stripping mediocre samurai of their statuses, effectively making the samurai a meritocracy. Prince Regent Mitsuhito has blamed Xiazhou’s failure on a lack of morale and purpose for the bushi (synonym of samurai) and agrees that meritocracy could revitalize them. Debate about the Military Question has begun to rage across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.A;All this because of an admiral and his book?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.T;Imperial Declaration on Military Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.D;The Military Question has become impossible for the Daijo-Kan to ignore, and the time has come to decide the future of the Japanese armed forces. There are three general options. First, the Daijo-Kan could support the tozama daimyo’s proposal to impose meritocracy upon the samurai, an idea which the Sessho-no-miya prefers since it would ensure the preservation of the samurai in some form. Second, they could draft a reform to slowly eliminate the samurai class, replacing them with a professional officer corps, but without any sudden shocks to Japanese military organization. Finally, they could embrace the radicals’ proposal to hire advisors from Europe to teach the military the lessons learned from the Great German Wars, as well as familiarize them with modern European weapons. What shall become of the Japanese military?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.A;The best commanders of Europe shall teach us their ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.B;Professional officers shall slowly replace the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.C;The samurai shall become meritocratic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.T;The Osaka Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.D;Japan’s malaise has led to increasing violence by reformists. In reaction, a traditionalist group whose name and motto is Sonno Joi, or, “Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians,” has formed, supporting Neo-Confucianism and a Sakoku or “closed country” policy. Even some traditionalists view them as a nuisance since Western trade and technology are critical for us, but some of the bushi admire Sonno Joi. These samurai have now caused trouble in Osaka, the most important city of Japan--its primary trade port, one of only three free trade ports along with Yokohama and Nagasaki, and with less powers for the Gaikoku Bugyo, foreign policy magistrates. This all has led to it possessing a large foreigner community. Yesterday, a small number of Sonno Joi samurai attacked the Anglois Merchants’ Association, killing a trader named Samuel Gallois. A crackdown was immediately launched against the Sonno Joi on the order of Mitsuhito to forestall Western retaliation, but the trade question has seized the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.A;A poor way to revere the emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.T;Trial of the Osaka Four;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.D;While the Sonno Joi movement has been curtailed across the nation, there is still the matter of Gallois’ murderers. Four samurai known to either belong to the Sonno Joi movement or support it--Sakuma Taketo, Fukuhara Hashimoto, Sanai Echigo, and Akane Shozan --appear to have been the orchestrators of the Osaka Incident. The Imperial judges in Osaka have found all four guilty of murder, and the Dual Monarchy was content with the verdict and reparations offered by the Imperial Court. The main question is whether the samurai will be allowed to commit seppuku to keep their honor, or whether we wish to have them executed as commoners to show the severity of the judgement and perhaps send a message about the future of the samurai class if such events occur again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.A;Allow them an honorable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.B;They are rebels and traitors, to the gallows with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.T;Imperial Declaration on Kaikoku Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.D;The Osaka Incident has inspired the various proponents of Kaikoku or “open country” policy to come together to try to change the official policy concerning the opening of the country to foreign trade, putting pressure on the Daijo-Kan to act. Currently, only Osaka is freely open to foreign trade, while controlled by Imperial functionaries. This excludes the leased ports of Yokohama and Nagasaki, which have become foreign enclaves. For many daimyo, further opening to trade would allow them to modernize their domains, and thus there is a strong movement to open the country even more. Moderates advise a middle ground, gradually expanding foreign access to Japan and loosening trade restrictions but preserving aspects of state control and supervision. However, the growth of the Sonno Joi movement has left a mark on our nation, and even after its curtailment there are those who believe its adherents had good ideas about preserving national integrity. What shall become of Japanese trade laws?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.A;Kaikoku must be expanded to bring prosperity to our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP8.T;Christianity in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.D; Kirishitan are still present in Japan, but they are not what they used to be. Most Catholics are located in the Arima domain in northern Kyushu where they form an important minority along with the daimyo, thanks notably to the Jesuits of Spanish-leased Nagasaki. Meanwhile some Protestant missionaries have entered Japan through Burgundian-leased Yokohama and have converted many intellectuals over the years and have even begun to sway members of the Musashi clan itself. The status of the Christian faith, in any iteration, is ambiguous at best in Japan. Formally, it is not allowed outside of foreign legations in Osaka, and banned throughout the Imperial demesne, for example. Yet the longevity of the Christian presence and the consequences of Kaikoku mean that it has still made inroads across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.A;Hello, my name is Father Chiarra, and I am here to tell you about a most amazing book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.T;The Sadao Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.D;Shinto is an ancient Japanese polytheistic faith revolving around the kami, divine spirits which inhabit all things, and kannagara, the “way of the kami,” upholding the nature order. The growth of Japanese religious nationalism has given rise to “State Shinto,” an informal system of government-supported Shintoism. This favoritism has caused an issue in Hiroshima, due to a printer named Sadao Aoko. Owning one of the city’s largest presses, he made a fortune printing Western books at cheap prices. Towards the end of his life, he sought spiritual advice from Buddhists, Catholics, and Shintoists. Sadao recently died, and he willed his shop to three different temples-Buddhist, Catholic, and Shinto! Samurai belonging to each religion entered the city to defend their faith’s claim to the shop. After a riot in front of the shop, all bushi involved were arrested. Imperial judges awarded the shop to the Shintoists, but religious tensions are inflamed, while the Spanish government lodged a complaint since one bushi was apparently a Jesuit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.A;Our religious situation is growing perilous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.T;Imperial Declaration on Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.D;The Sadao Affair represents a dangerous recurrence not seen in many years, a clash of samurai not over Japan’s government but over matters of faith, and one which has begun to open up old wounds across the country. If we want to avoid being ripped apart by religious turmoil like so many Western nations, then we must determine a national religious policy. Three options are before the Daijo-Kan. Reformists seek to establish true freedom of religion throughout Japan, creating protections against religious discrimination to prevent sectarianism. Moderates want to formally establish support for State Shinto but also want to establish limited religious pluralism to avoid unnecessary conflict. Finally, the traditionalists, in their quest to uphold the kokutai, demand extensive support for State Shinto and the explicit confirmation, by law, of the emperor’s status as a living kami, deifying him. What shall become of Japanese religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.A;The only path to religious peace is religious freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
NJAP10.B;We shall support State Shinto but other faiths will be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.C;Shinto is supreme and the emperor's divinity is undeniable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.T;Education in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.D;For centuries, Japan has been a center of learning and education. Confucianism, introduced ages ago, stresses the importance of an educated elite, while samurai have grown to be expected to be as skilled in literature and poetry as they are on the battlefield. Over time, however, it has become obvious that Japanese educational systems, though sufficient for literacy and everyday skills, have not advanced much in contrast to the leaps and bounds of Western methods. Though reformers frequently point to the school systems of Europe and Arcadia as models for Japan, traditionalists maintain that it is merely the techniques and resources which are lacking. This issue has begun to weigh upon the Sessho-no-miya and the Daijo-Kan as the Imperial Prince, heir to the Emperor, approaches the age where he must begin his education. A decision will need to be made, not just for the sake of the throne, but for Japan’s intellectual future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.A;Time to go back to school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.T;The Fukuzawa Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.D;At the request of the Prince Regent, a group of scholars led by famed author and orator Baigan Fukuzawa have toured Europe and Arcadia, their primary goal being to investigate different Western methods of education in order to determine which elements Japan might adopt. The schools and universities of Anvers, Nouvelle Bruges, Paris, Prague, Stockholm, and Bologna were all visited and inspected by the Fukuzawa Mission. They have finally returned and presented their findings to the regent. Fukuzawa has endorsed the adoption of Western teaching methods, the pursuit of national literacy, and the support of universities. While this mission was limited in scope and we might benefit from a more substantial and broadened endeavor in the future, this information has fueled arguments regarding the merits of Western education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.A;Mitsuhito seemed unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.T;Education of the Imperial Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.D;The question of a national education policy and the question of the heir's education have become linked. Whichever method we choose to use for him shall shape him as a ruler and signal to the people our preferred course for Japanese education. Within the Daijo-Kan, reformists have proposed to scour Europe for the finest scholars and invite them to Kyoto to ensure that the Prince receives the most modern education possible. Moderates have suggested that scholars from the Yosho Shirabesho, a new school and research center in Edo founded by a group of famous academics to use Western literature and methods in a Japanese context, should be brought to educate the heir. Finally, Prince Regent Mitsuhito has declared that, as he is kin of the emperor and thus “blessed by the kami,” he should educate the heir, and it is likely that he would rely heavily on the traditionalists to aid him. What shall become of Japanese education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.A;We need a new vision - bring foreign preceptors to Kyoto!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.B;The Yosho Shirabesho shall teach next Emperor in a balanced way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.C;The blessed Prince Regent Mitsuhito shall instruct the heir personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.T;The Decline of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.D;Several institutions have come to dominate the Japanese economic landscape. The most prominent are the kabunakama, government-licensed guilds given sanctioned monopolies on certain trades such as woodcutting or brewing and operated via a group of shareholders each holding non-transmissible shares. Other groups include toimaru, wholesale merchants focused on storage and shipping, and even the venerable za, the pre-Sengoku guilds. In the aftermath of the Sengoku, Nobunaga tried to reign in the guilds by creating ‘free’ guilds known as rakuza, but many of these were eventually assimilated by the older guilds into a new type of guild, the nakama. The government then attempted to start licensing these nakama, transforming them into kabunakama, but they have now become a problem. Over the last century or so, these kabunakama have come to dominate the market, and increasing industrialization and foreign competition is hurting their profits. This has now sparked a recession and even the Imperial treasury is hurting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.A;We must untangle our economy from these guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.T;'Raikichi-Raikuza';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.D;Japan is abuzz with the new treatise, ‘Raikichi-Raikuza’ or ‘Free markets and Open guilds,’ written by Mizuno Heihachiro, Osaka’s eccentric daimyo. In it, Mizuno declares that Nobunaga sought to rebalance the Japanese economy through ‘Raikichi-rakuza’, placing urban economies into the hands of local merchants rather than guilds. This originated from the daimyo Rokakku Sayadori of Omi Province in the town of Ishidera during the Sengoku. Rokakku dissolved the za of Ishidera, granting exclusive sales and non-taxation rights to local merchants and tradesmen. This transformed the town into a trade hub, and the practice spread across Japan. However, it also fed a growing black market in order to meet rising demand. The conquest of Korea distracted the Japanese government, allowing many guilds to creep back into prominence. Mizuno concludes by arguing that these daimyo were the forerunners of liberalism. The book has become popular as people seek new financial solutions during the recession, much to the guilds’ ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP16.D;Traditionally, each daimyo has had the right to issue their own currency, known as hansatu, while merchants have issued loans and guilds have managed trade, resulting in a disjointed financial system. A group of Osaka merchants, however, aims to change this. They have founded a new institution, the First Bank of Osaka. The goal of this bank is to store clients’ money, supply loans, print money, and make investments. The bank’s new shareholders have made it a priority to lobby the government to support new financial developments, pointing to the proliferation of Western corporations throughout Japan and arguing that Japan must develop its own indigenous corporations. All this has been done with the sanction of Mizuno Heihachiro, who has shielded the Bank from guild retaliation. The Bank’s openness and reliability has brought stability to Osaka, causing Mitsuhito to tolerate this experiment, but the kabunakama are enraged. At the same time, the Bank’s success has led people to question if guilds are still relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.A;The end of the kabunakama?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.T;Imperial Declaration on Guilds and Corporations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.D;The founding of the First Bank of Osaka has angered both guilds and reactionary daimyo across Japan. They are horrified at its infringement upon their traditional rights regarding money printing and commerce, as well as the unprecedented power which these merchants are claiming for themselves, with a daimyo’s blessing no less! The issue has reached the Imperial Court, and the Great Council must decide the fate of the Japanese economy. Reformists proclaim Mizuno to be the prophet of a free-market rebirth that Japan should embrace. Moderates propose the creation of state-supported corporations to replace the guilds, but without sacrificing state influence over the economy. Finally, traditionalists argue that the guilds are a cornerstone of Japan, and that they should be helped to modernize and reform themselves to keep the economy running smoothly, not be discarded. What shall become of the Japanese economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.A;Mizuno is right, market liberalism was born in Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.B;We must find and form new corporations to challenge the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.C;The guilds must evolve, but remain relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.T;Twilight of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.D;Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito had just emerged from his morning prayer session when the emperor’s chief physician asked for a private word with him. After making their way to the Regent’s chambers, the physician brought forth shocking news : Tenno Komei is dying. While he had never recovered from his maiming in 1835, essentially becoming vegetative, it now appears that he is reaching the end of his life. His breathing is becoming increasingly strained, his pulse growing fainter with each day, and his general condition is rapidly deteriorating. Preparations must soon be made – first for the Emperor’s passing, and then, after a period of mourning, for the heir’s coronation. Above all, however, this information must be withheld from the public so as not to cause even more chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.A;No matter what, this must not leak out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.T;Jiyu Minken Undo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.D;News of Komei’s impending death has already leaked, and now a specter is haunting Japan – the specter of political parties. For the first time, a group of like-minded reformists have come together under the banner of a Western-style organization, the Jiyu Minken Undo, or Freedom and People’s Rights Movement. Led by intellectuals but seeking to organize liberal and democratic-minded people across all social classes, the Jiyuto, as it is commonly known, hopes to use the Emperor’s passing to pressure the government for massive social reforms. Their primary demands are for a formal Japanese constitution that will enshrine the rights of the people, and many Jiyuto members also wish to push for a democratic voting system, including an elected national legislature. A few especially wild-eyed fanatics support such insane ideas as greater equality for the sexes! While purging them would be the simple option, they have brought many intellectuals into their ranks, including most scholars and educators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.A;What bizarre ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.T;The Kimimasa Draft;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.D;Kimimasa Yokoi is an infamous Japanese liberal author who fled into exile after being sought by the Imperial authorities for his pro-democracy tracts. He has shown particular interest in Burgundian and New World constitutionalism. After spending time in Atlantia, the Belgian Confederacy, Burgundy, and Vinland, Kimimasa has traveled to Hong Kong where he has joined the Jiyuto and written his most ambitious project yet : a draft for a Japanese constitution. It includes common suffrage, abolition of the class system, a Western style parliament, and the sanctioning of political parties. Kimimasa has also mentioned the “frustrations” which liberals have experienced in “service to hereditary incompetents and military dictators,” an obvious slur against the Prince Regent using the common insult of Neo-Shogun. The Gaikoku Bugyo heavily censored the work, but even they could not completely prevent its circulation, and now more and more of Japan seems to be infected with liberalism. The Jiyuto hail him as their prophet…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.A;"All people must speak and be heard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.T;The Obama Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.D;Japan is no stranger to peasant insurrections, as rural communities periodically find themselves driven to violence in order to protest tyrannical officials or to resist taxation. An incident has occurred in the town of Obama, located on the northern coast and ruled by the Sakai clan, who have been eager participants in maritime trade. The Sakai have raised higher and higher taxes on the town’s fishermen in order to attract trade via low import fees. When it was announced that taxes would be increased for the third time in three weeks, the fishermen finally snapped. Wielding fishing spears and sailor’s knives, they stormed and torched the tax collector’s office before ransacking the merchant district, touching off a general riot and extensive looting before Sarai samurai finally restored order. Disturbingly, this occurred within the Imperial domain, and the bushi report that the fishermen not only shouted Jiyuto slogans, but even called for the overthrow of the monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.A;Anarchy, treason, madness - thanks, Obama...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.T;Drama in the Daijo-Kan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.D;Tensions between Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito and the rest of the Great Council have finally erupted over the question of national security. Mitsuhito is convinced that the Obama Uprising proves that a vast conspiracy exists between liberals and newly insurgent republicans to overthrow and dissolve the Empire and replace it with a Western democratic clique. He therefore demands nothing less than an immediate and nationwide purge of the Jiyuto. Although much of the council has grown to distrust the movement, and agree that the republicans must be arrested, they and many other daimyo worry that giving Mitsuhito such a sweeping mandate could be used by the Prince Regent as a pretext to claim absolute power and crush all checks to his rule. Reformists argue that the government should focus on addressing legitimate grievances rather than seeking someone to blame, while the moderates support limited arrests with public gestures to reaffirm Imperial authority. Traditionalists, however, are ready to strike and await Mitsuhito’s command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.A;The issues raised by the liberals ring true, and we must address them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.B;A few arrests of troublesome bushi will restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.C;Let the streets run red with the blood of traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.T;Cherry Blossoms in the Evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.D;Shortly after sunset yesterday night, Tenno Komei finally passed away. He had never truly recovered since 1835, but perhaps this was a blessing, as he never saw the chaos which Japan has spiralled through since then, nor did he pass with any pain. As per procedure, upon the chief royal physician pronouncing the Emperor’s death, the Imperial Prince was immediately presented with the Imperial Regalia, a replica of the legendary Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or “Grasscutter Sword” and the royal Magatama necklace, confirming his status as the next to succeed. Imperial messengers and priests were sent to the Ise Grand Shrine, said to be the home of Amaterasu, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new Tenno's accession. Soon, all of Japan shall be in mourning, but Prince Regent Mitsuhito and the rest of the Daijo-Kan must prepare for the coronation, when the royal heir shall finally assume the Chrysanthemum Throne as the next Emperor of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.A;And so the sakura petals fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.T;The Start of the Meiji Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.D;”Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for Our enlightened government. It is the joy and glory of Our heart to behold the prosperity of Our country, and it is in the furtherance of the welfare of Our subjects that this prosperity shall be advanced. All classes, high and low, shall be united in the fulfillment of their promises to Our Imperial Ancestors, just as We shall fulfill Our promise to the people to bestow upon them their Natural rights. And it is through assemblies of sagacious deliberation that the rights of the people shall be expressed.” The day that liberals dreamed of and traditionalists feared has finally arrived, as the Meiji Emperor heralds the advent of Japanese democracy. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are beginning to understand their roles in a post-feudal Japan. The newly promulgated Meiji Constitution has instituted significant protections for the rights of the people, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament drawing from all classes has laid the foundations for a true democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.A;A new day dawns, in equally new colors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.T;Fleeting Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.D;Twenty minutes before the coronation, the Imperial Prince was filled with excitement and with fear, with grief and with hope. His father had passed with a breath in the night, and now here he was, on the cusp of being made sovereign of Japan. So much planning, preparation, his entire education-no, his whole life, all leading up to this moment. Yet, he still was unsure of what sort of ruler he would be. Should he set bold goals and ally with the reformists to bring real parliamentary monarchism to Japan, or strive for a compromise between the Imperial Court and the daimyo to preserve Japan’s national character as it modernizes? Was this nation ready for truly liberal democracy? As he prepared to ascend the Takamikura, he made his decision…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.A;The time has come for serious reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.B;Tranquility must be maintained even in modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.T;The Start of the Tensho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.D;”Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for bringing balance upon this land and seeking the correct form of all things. The time has come for the lands of the Empire to be reconciled with one another, and to vigorously carry out righteous and meritorious conduct. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything shall be based upon the just laws of Nature. The ensuring of tranquility will be Our foremost goal, and it shall be built upon a strong foundation of knowledge sought throughout the world.” The Tensho Emperor has inaugurated an age of constitutionalism. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have begun to trust the Imperial Court once again. The new Tensho Constitution has transformed Japanese law, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament has sown the seeds of democracy. However, the daimyo still play a powerful role in the nation, with industrial and military connections. Though reformists hope that the door to change has been opened, many wonder if the daimyo will really lose that much power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.A;A new day dawns, though the colors are familiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.T;The Start of the Kyowa Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.D;”Know ye, Our loyal subjects, that we shall be known for following Heaven and taking Our destiny, uniting all people and perfecting Our righteousness. We have come to deliver ye and this land from those who would deprive it of life and vitality. No longer shall We be bound by the constraints of the machinations of men, nor shall We let any man be humbled before the barbarian. Our Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis of unbreakable strength and everlasting fidelity, and We call upon you now to fulfill their desires and preserve their inheritance. The time has come for ye, Our subjects, to render illustrious service unto Us. We, the descendant of Ninigi, blessed ruler of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, he who descended from great Amaterasu-Omikami, are effervescent with heavenly splendor, and shall bring about a new age of glory and righteousness upon all eight corners of the world.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.A;Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.T;The Heavenly Sovereign's Great Affirmation of Divinity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.D;Immediately after his coronation, Tenno Kyowa has begun to make sweeping changes. He has taken an unprecedented interest in politics, demanding regular reports on domestic and foreign affairs, and proclaimed the end of Kaikoku, forcing foreigners into the leased ports. He has established his own political movement, the Kodoha or “Imperial Way Faction,” which he demands all his subjects must join, while banning all other political parties. Yet these pale in comparison to his most prominent policy, apotheosis. While Shintoism holds that the Tenno is descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, Tenno Kyowa has made this law. In his Great Affirmation of Divinity, he has made denial of his divine status punishable by death, dissolved the Daijo-Kan, and created the Ministry of Divinity to promulgate his status as the chief god on Earth. By nature of his divine status, he has asserted his right to singular rule. Why, he asks, would a god need the counsel of mortals? Many people, especially daimyo, are starting to chafe at all this…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.A;Not, "Emperor," barbarian. Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.T;The Hiroshima Memorial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.D;Apostasy! Tenno Kyowa’s rigorous assertion of divine absolutism has finally driven the liberals to treason. A coalition of reformists and other opponents to the Emperor have been recruiting disgruntled daimyo in western Japan for some time. Now, this nest of vipers has issued the “Hiroshima Memorial,” declaring the Tenno to be “insane” and to have “trespassed beyond the will of Heaven,” and have finished by renouncing their oaths of vassalage! Just as old Mitsuhito feared, reformist daimyo have joined with the Jiyuto, with Kyowa’s liberal cousin Prince Takamado and a recently returned-from-exile Kimimasa becoming the symbolic leaders of this “Western Alliance.” This is blasphemy, but the reformists command sizable support, not only from their own followers, but from moderates and even some conservatives whom Kyowa has alienated. While State Shinto priests throughout the land declare that defying the Tenno’s will is heresy, many seem willing to risk damnation to overthrow the Empire. The nation sits on a knife edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.A;We shall BURN these heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Kyowa seeks to claim the heavens and all beneath them, while the western daimyo have made a desperate pact with the liberals to oppose him under the banner of the Western Alliance. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. Shall we cast our lot with one of these factions, or shall we seek to weather the storm alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.A;The rebels are our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.B;We shall be an island within the typhoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.C;The Tenno is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.D;After the treasonous and blasphemous memorial of the abominable Western Alliance, Tenno Kyowa hoped to decapitate their insurrection by quickly deploying small groups of royal regiments to seize rebellious daimyo. This has backfired tremendously, as these regiments quickly came under attack from the daimyo’s retainers, who repelled them in short order. After executing the incompetent fools that allowed such a debacle to occur, the Tenno began preparing a larger force, but it seems that the element of surprise has been lost. The Alliance has raised the flag of rebellion and announced their intention to depose the Emperor, as vast swathes of Japan rise up with them. While not all daimyo have joined them, some have declared neutrality, threatening to attack anyone who enters their domains. The future of the Empire is at stake! Shall the holy Tenno Kyowa claim the heavens and all below them or is this the end of his grand design? For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.A;Tennhoku Kyowa Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.B;The Western Alliance shall end this nightmare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.T;An Age of Glory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.D;Victory! Tenno Kyowa has crushed the Western Alliance, and his divine and absolute rule has been confirmed. All possible threats to his power, be it from raving republicans, cowardly daimyo, or scurrying so-called “moderates,” have felt either the cold hard stone of the prison cell or the merciless steel of the executioner’s blade. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted their places within the Heaven-ordained Natural order, with the glorious Tenno Kyowa as Heaven’s appointed leader on Earth. The Ministry of Divinity shall work tirelessly to eradicate false faiths, liberalism shall be annihilated, and foreign thought kept under strict control and oversight. Only the best and most useful outside ideas will be assimilated into our blessed Dai Nippon Teihoku. With the nation finally consolidated under one rule-that of our sacred, unquestionable monarch and his loyal Imperial Court-we may turn our attention and our energies to the borders. Kyowa shall bring all eight corners of the world under one roof!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.A;A new day dawns, and the Rising Sun illuminates all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.T;Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyo’s own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the mad Kyowa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyo’s tanto knife wrapped in cloth. The blade placed before him, the daimyo calmly composes his last poem, remarking solemnly on the petals of the sakura tree as they fall upon the moonlit water. Then, he consumes a ceremonial cup of sake, as his attendant does likewise. Wrapping the tanto’s handle in the cloth to maintain his grip, as his attendant stands by and draws his katana, the daimyo opens his kimono, raises the tanto, and pays the price of honor with a left-to-right cut through his abdomen before his attendant delivers the second blow through his neck. Throughout the castle, his samurai follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.A;The way of the warrior is to be found in dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.T;Daybreak;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over. The clouds of the storm have passed, and Emperor Kyowa stands triumphant. Japan shall surely be reforged in his image, and while he has passed sentence upon all daimyo who rose against him, the fate of those who neither aided nor opposed him is uncertain. While his now-overwhelming strength would seem to dictate that our only option is to renew our oath of vassalage to him, a few of the younger and more hot-headed samurai have urged our daimyo to formally declare independence. They argue that it is better to face the possibility of the Emperor’s wrath with honor than to meekly submit and once again place the Imperial yoke upon our necks. However, most samurai, older men who remember stories of rebels past, would prefer that the daimyo end his renegade status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.A;Love live the Emperor...may the Heavens help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.B;It is better to die in defiance than to live in submission!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.T;An Age of Rebirth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.D;Victory! The mad emperor has been defeated and his dreams of domination thwarted. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike awake from the nightmare of Kyowa’s arrogance into the reality of a more just Japan. Already, reformists have begun crafting a new constitution based on the Burgundian model, with a balanced government and separation of powers. The only question now is what path the new Japan shall take. Liberal daimyo want to reshape the monarchy along parliamentary lines and enthrone Prince Takamado as Emperor Meiji, “enlightened government,” while Kimimasa and the Jiyuto see the monarchy as morally bankrupt and prefer a republic. While many agree that Kyowa has sullied the Chrysanthemum Throne, the idea of ending a millenia-old monarchy is daunting. The bushi seem especially wary of the wave of democracy which has been unleashed, and may cause trouble if the monarchy is dissolved. At the insistence of the moderates, a vote is held among the leaders of the Western Alliance to decide the fate of Japan…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.A;Long live Emperor Meiji, long live parliamentarianism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.B;Enough with thrones, let the republicans forge a new Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.T;Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over, and the rebels have triumphed. Though we have lent our strength to them for this victory, some wonder if their more radical elements might not be keen to reward us. Regardless, the mad Emperor Kyowa has been vanquished, and we may now return to stewarding our domain in Kyoto’s name, whoever its ruler might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.A;We have chosen well...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.T;Dusk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Kyowa. All his agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, anti-Kaikoku foreign policy magistrates, kabunakama guild members, the Ministry of Divinity, or reactionary daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served the Emperor, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again. We had best leave as soon as possible, before the rebel armies arrive to confiscate your property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.A;I hear that Tawantinsuyu is nice this time of year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.T;The Start of the Koshi Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.D;”Know ye, Our subjects, that we shall be known for broad and vast peace. We have resolved that the disorder that has filled the lands under Heaven shall not be brought forth by Our hands, nor the hands of our most loyal and benevolent subjects. We seek absolute concord, and the furtherance of the tranquility which has always been the dearest wish of Our hearts. The filial honor that binds all of Our subjects to Us, and Us to Our subjects, is an unbreakable cord, and well it be that none seek to strain or sever it. We shall not abide those who seek to plunge these magnificent and abundant lands into tumult, nor those who would pour forth the fountain of rage upon the nations. It shall be with the open hand that Our subjects must embrace and be embraced. The path of ages is beyond the ken of any man, yet its general progression leads irresistibly towards a more perfected society. It is the realization of this condition of national harmony that We ask all of Our subjects to strive towards, for Our sake and for all peoples.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.A;...Banzai?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.T;The Great Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.D;Even before his enthronement, Emperor Koshi had been working on a secretive project. His attendants have brought him books on history, government, and law, and rumors alleged that he even slipped out of the palace in disguise to meet with foreigners! Few believed this, but now, to the horror of the daimyo, Emperor Koshi has issued an unprecedented decree. Known as “The Imperial Declaration on Righteous and Reformed Government,” or simply the “Great Reform,” it is a total transformation of the Japanese political system. It contains colossal changes : circumscribing the powers of the Imperial Court, adopting the Kimimasa Draft as the official Japanese constitution, creating an independent legislature and judiciary, sanctioning political parties and public meetings, ending border controls and state censorship, releasing all jailed political activists, disavowing imperialism, banning state funding of religion…! It concludes by proclaiming that exiled liberal Kimimasa Yokoi himself is invited to return and be made Prime Minister!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.A;He did WHAT!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.T;Shogun Mitsuhito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.D;The Great Reform has thrown Japan into chaos. The daimyo are apoplectic with rage towards Koshi, despairing at what they see as national ruination. Now, one man has decided to act. While many opponents of former Prince Regent and current Great Chancellor Mitsuhito, the emperor’s uncle, had insulted him by dubbing him a “Neo-Shogun,” few imagined that he would confirm this. However, this morning the Great Chancellor gave an astonishing speech in which he denounced the Emperor as deranged! “We must shun the poisoned fruit of Europe’s blood-soaked republicanism,” he declared. Accusing reformists of conspiring with the West, he called for a strong foreign policy and the defense of the kokutai and the kannagara. He capped off this incredible address by invoking his office and his Yamato and Oda heritage to declare himself Shogun and announced his intention to depose the Emperor! With a retinue of reactionary samurai and the support of many daimyo, he has marched on Kyoto, and is approaching the Imperial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.A;Stop this madman at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.T;The Unthinkable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.D;Japanese tradition holds that the first emperor of Japan was Emperor Jimmu, whose reign began in 660 B.C. Western historians argue that the first historically verifiable emperor was Emperor Kinmei, whose reign began in 539 A.D. What is notable is that, for one to two thousand years, no emperor of Japan has ever been assassinated. Today, however, an immutable shadow has been cast over all Japanese history. While the pretender Shogun Mitsuhito’s army attacked the main royal force stationed outside the palace, he and his retainers were able to infiltrate it. Aided by sympathetic attendants and his knowledge of the palace’s shortcuts from his years living within it, he easily made his way to the throne room. Demanding Emperor Koshi’s immediate abdication, he grew angry when the Emperor politely but firmly refused. In the struggle with the royal guards which followed, the Koshi emperor attempted to escape, but his uncle showed no mercy and committed a cataclysmic transgression. Emperor Koshi has been assassinated by Mitsuhito!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.A;And a rage in Heaven shall surely follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.T;Kegare;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.D;Kegare is the Shinto conception of spiritual impurity, and Mitsuhito seems to have immersed himself in it. With Emperor Koshi newly dead, Mitsuhito has held the briefest of funerals to mark his passing, before coronating himself as Emperor, under the regnal name of Showa, “Heavenly Peace.” News of the slaying, however, has spread like wildfire, and vast swathes of Japan are beside themselves with fury. Many accuse Tenno Showa of having committed the first Japanese regicide, not just against the Emperor for whom Mitsuhito was regent but against his own nephew. Daimyo and bushi across the land decry him as a demon incarnate. Many daimyo have rallied under Prince Konoe, Showa’s cousin and a pragmatist. Konoe has denounced Showa as a megalomaniacal kinslayer and has vowed to oust him and create a sensible monarchy. Meanwhile, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki has emerged from retirement to lead an army of radicals and bushi against Showa, declaring monarchism unsalvageable and calling for a republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.A;Do these fools not understand that this was a necessary evil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Showa has shattered every law of man and kami in his quest for absolute power, while both the moderates and the radicals have chosen leaders to bear their standards against the Chrysanthemum Throne. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. We must cast our lot with one of these factions, but which one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.A;The revolution has arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.B;Prince Konoe shall save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.C;The Emperor is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.D;As soon as Tenno Showa heard that Konoe and Yusumoto had risen against him, he called upon all those still loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne to resist the rebels and serve their emperor. Though some have obeyed, many more have shunned him for committing the unforgivable sin of assassinating Emperor Koshi, his own blood relative. While the daimyo and bushi of Japan might have been outraged by Koshi’s policies, few went so far as to call for his head, and Showa’s shockingly brutal usurpation has shattered the nation. Japan is now splintered between those who serve the Emperor, right or wrong, and those who cannot abide by Showa’s actions. The moderate monarchists and the radical republicans have both declared their intention to claim all of Japan for their respective causes. As daimyo consider joining one of these factions or fortifying their domains and declaring neutrality, the nation braces for yet more blood to be shed in the name of the Rising Sun. For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.A;Tennhoku Showa Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#NJAP43.B;Prince Konoe shall save us from this madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#NJAP43.C;Long live the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP44.T;An Age of Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP44.D;Victory! Emperor-no, enough of that barbarian word! TENNO Showa, Heavenly Sovereign Showa, has crushed all opposition, and his control of the Chrysanthemum Throne is secure. Across the country, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted Showa as their sovereign, even if they do so only because of our bushi patrolling their villages. Both Konoe and Yusumoto have failed to conquer Japan, and their movements have melted before our might. As we speak, Tenno Showa’s forces are sweeping through the nation, and all traitors shall be duly punished. Our officers assure Tenno Showa that the scourge of liberal democracy has been eradicated. The time might have come for the Dai Nippon Taihoku to enter modernity, but the kokutai shall not be destroyed in the process.

NJAP45.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyo’s own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the vile Showa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyo’s tanto knife wrapped in cloth. The blade placed before him, the daimyo calmly composes his last poem, remarking solemnly on the petals of the sakura tree as they fall upon the moonlit water. Then, he consumes a ceremonial cup of sake, as his attendant does likewise. Wrapping the tanto’s handle in the cloth to maintain his grip, as his attendant stands by and draws his katana, the daimyo opens his kimono, raises the tanto, and pays the price of honor with a left-to-right cut through his abdomen before his attendant delivers the second blow through his neck. Throughout the castle, his samurai follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP46.T;An Age of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP46.D;Victory! We have defeated the despicable kinslayer who dared to call himself “Emperor Showa,” as well as the militant republicans. Prince Konoe has been enthroned as Emperor, taking the regnal name of Heisei, or “Peace Everywhere.” This name is indeed a great longing for the Japanese people, who wish to restore harmony after decades of chaos. Considering this, Emperor Heisei has proven to be a greater ally of the reformists than many expected, promising to work with them and even proclaiming the formation of an Imperial Parliament. While Heisei has claimed to oppose radicalism, the fact that he has left much of Koshi’s Great Reform in place has shocked many conservatives, though the bushi’s defeat seems to have shattered their political power. Most of his subjects can hardly complain about having a pragmatic Emperor, considering his predecessor. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are looking towards the future with renewed hope. Perhaps the unity which has been so out of reach in years past may finally be at hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP48.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Showa or Yusumoto. All their agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, ambitious military officers, kabunakama guild members, or opportunistic daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served their enemies, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again. We had best leave as soon as possible, before the rebel armies arrive to confiscate your property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP49.D;Victory! The bushi have defied the odds and created a bold new Japanese Republic. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike behold a nation in the hands of its greatest defenders. The first order of business was the public execution of the false kinslaying emperor-Showa might have thought himself blessed by Heaven, but the executioner’s blade and the crematorium thought otherwise. This has been taken badly by those already reeling from one Imperial death, creating instability. Furthermore, many reformists seem wary of a revolution imposed by the bushi. Tragically, Admiral Yusumoto perished in battle, leaving his successors to guide the nation. His lieutenant, Saigo Ryoma, has been appointed President pending new elections. Few would have imagined samurai leading the revolution, but we have realized our true role as the stewards of Japan, and we shall both advance its interests and protect its heritage. Under the firm yet benevolent hand of democracy, Japan shall reap untold riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP52.D;Astonishing news has reached us-Japan has plunged into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of the previous Emperor and the enthronement of his son and heir caused difficulties owing to the character and conduct of his successor. This has caused all semblance of Japanese rule in Joseon to crumble, as Japanese administrators find their communications with Kyoto severed. As Japan leaps once more into the fire, Korean sovereignty has been restored, but we should not be quick to rejoice. The northern bandit army which has the audacity to call itself Goryeo, and which also claims to be the true government of Korea, will surely strike against us now that the mailed hand of Japan’s imperial rule no longer checks them. It seems that our newfound freedom will already need to be defended. And of course, if and when Japan emerges from their conflict, our reconquest will probably be one of their first priorities…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP53.D;Wonderful news has reached us-Japan has plunged back into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of yet another one of their delusional emperors and the enthronement of his wretched spawn caused difficulties owing to the heir’s presumably wicked personality. This has caused the cowardly Japanese colony to find its puppet-strings severed, as Japanese administrators find their chauvinism brought low by the righteous anger of the long-oppressed Goryeonminjok. But, enough talk, now is the time for action! The pretenders in the south have already organized a preposterous regime that is the obvious inheritor of Japan’s colonial legacy. There is no time to waste, we must march south and unite the peninsula before the Japanese beast returns. For a free and whole Goryeo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

While we daimyo shall be compensated for our lost estates, and be entitled to the honorary status of genro, or “elder statesmen,” the curtain is now falling on an entire epoch of Japanese history.

Yet the air of presumptive importance he carried, his cold, seemingly emotionless face, and the frigid manner with which he treated every Korean he saw made his identity unmistakable. He was an agent of the Japanese government, and he had come to deliver the notice that all of our cabinet had been dreading. “Japan has emerged from its moment of unpleasantness,” he intoned to us. “The Korean situation has been neglected, but we have now prepared to set all affairs in order and restore the Japanese administration.” He gave the King an iron stare, his contempt flashing from his eyes. “Will there be any difficulties in resuming our duties here?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

As the governor lowers the territory’s flag in the square of the capital, it is a bittersweet moment. While most colonists are glad to be reunited with their mother country-nobody will miss having to defend against raids from the natives-we are all aware that this represents the loss of our status as a true frontier, and the freedom which that status provided. As the flag of Japan is raised over the capital, for the first time with no other banner to accompany it, all who gaze upon it know that things will never be the same again in Kanakagawa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

After failing to convince the government to pass the Tozama Plan to preserve the samurai, Hozumi resigned, returned home, and founded a private military academy for fellow dissatisfied bushi. The news that these samurai had begun to acquire government positions across Tokushima, however, disturbed us, and soldiers were sent to investigate, as well as to secure the local arsenal. What happened next is disputed, but his supporters claim that soldiers attempted to arrest Hozumi, and his students retaliated, violently expelling them. Hozumi has now rallied the prefecture in rebellion, declaring himself to be the last defender of bushido!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,Hozumi Takemori, a samurai from Tokushima Prefecture.

NJAP62.D;Our soldiers, after shattering the samurai insurrection, searched for their leader to bring him back to the capital to face trial. It seems, however, that he chose to levy his own punishment upon himself. We found his headless corpse by the seaside, near the site of the last battle, his own blade buried in his stomach. According to a fisherman who observed the battle, Hozumi committed seppuku when the battle was clearly lost, and his attendant, after performing the customary decapitation, flung his head into the sea to prevent the government from being able to conclusively prove his death. This marks the end of the samurai as both a military and a political force in Japan, but the people seem to already be marveling at what they see as a martyred hero and even whisper of him escaping to places like Tawantinsuyu or China. Most of our government scoff at such romanticizing of an embittered rebel, but it seems that Hozumi has won one final battle : the battle for his memory, and that of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP63.T;The Edo Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP63.D;Scholar Nomura Ujikore has always had a reputation for rather strange ideological positions. Having led a group of liberals into the northern mountains to escape the previous government’s violent purge of reformists, Nomura only grew more radical in isolation. Upon return, his advocacy for social and gender equality made him many enemies, yet also led some to see Nomura as the last true republican. His base of support is the city of Edo, where officials had noted with concern the growing membership among workers in Nomura’s so-called “Free Press Party,” a group which has long been suspected as being a front for much more serious radicalism. This proved correct, as Nomura and a small army of followers have taken advantage of a small-scale dockworker strike to launch a rebellion! Armed cadres have seized control of Edo and stormed city hall, where Nomura has read a speech in which he has denounced the government as “the boot stamping upon the necks of the people,” and called for revolution! The revolt is already spreading beyond Edo…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP64.T;The Commune is Crushed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP64.D;As our soldiers fought their way through the barricades erected by Nomura’s fanatics, a small team of marines infiltrated the docks and made their way to Nomura’s headquarters. Taking the exterior guards by surprise, they fought their way through the building room-to-room, until they finally reached Nomura’s office. Though he attempted to commit suicide with a revolver, Captain Tanaka Hayato quickly disarmed and arrested him. By they time they emerged, the city was retaken, and Nomura was brought back to the capital for trial. Representing himself, Nomura spent most of his time railing against the government, denouncing it for “blithely inheriting the cruel attitudes of the past.” Convicted for treason, he was brought before a firing squad in the capital barracks. Reportedly, his final words were…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP65.T;The End of the Leased Ports;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP65.D;Over the last few hundred years, our nation’s influence in Japan grew so great among local daimyo that we were able to negotiate the lease of a port city, which became an important enclave. Nagasaki and Yokohama were, along with Osaka, the only truly free-trade ports in Japan, and renowned centers of intellectual and cultural exchange in addition to their status as economic hubs. However, despite this being a negotiated agreement, the Japanese have always felt uneasy about foreigners holding their lands, and it seems that the Japanese government has finally decided not to renew our lease. Their representatives assure us that they will obey the terms of the lease’s early termination clause and reimburse us, though our lawyers protest that exchange rates have changed dramatically since the contract was written and this sum is far lower than what they ought to pay. Regardless, at this point they seem dead set on reclaiming the ports, and to resist them would mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP66.D;In the upheavals which wracked China over the last two hundred years, we, the inheritors of the great Ming, were forced to retreat further and further from the Imperial heartland. Having finally been driven all the way to the island of Taiwan, it seems that even this was not a safe refuge. We have once again come under attack, but this time not from a competitor to the legacy of the Middle Kingdom, but from the Empire of Japan! They have claimed the island which has become our haven, impudently threatening war if we do not hand it over at once. While our officials have prepared emergency evacuation plans to our holdings in Liusung, also known as Tondo, to do this would be a highly traumatic and humiliating affair. Beyond the shame of surrendering to the Japanese without a fight, moving our capital to such distant lands would be seen as all but forfeiting our claim to China.

NJAP68.T;The Saigo Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP68.D;Saigo Ryoma, famous general and founding member of the new regime, has gained a reputation for shrewdness, but he seems to have grown disillusioned with partisanship and decided that the time has come to end the democratic experiment. Today, flanked by stone-faced guards, he read out a pronouncement from the steps of the former Imperial Palace, declaring himself Gensui or “Marshall” and suspending the legislature! This has upended the nation, as Saigo had been trusted to use his influence to keep the military apolitical, not use it to seize power. While most of the military has been quick to pledge allegiance to Saigo, certain bushi have lambasted him for declining to restore the samurai to prominence, while the liberals are aghast at this demolition of Japan’s nascent democracy. The Gensui has already declared his intent to “restore conservatism,” which has not helped matters. With stirrings of rebellion and conspiracy in both the east and the west of the nation, it seems that Japan has not escaped the storm clouds yet…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP68.A;Long live Gensui Saigo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.T;The Saigo Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.D;Disaster was averted today, as several Parliamentary MPs were presented with incontrovertible evidence of a conspiracy led by famous general Saigo Ryoma to seize control of the nation and proclaim himself dictator! After the MPs contacted liberal and trustworthy members of the military to assist them, Saigo and his accomplices were taken by surprise in their homes and immediately made to resign all government positions before being arrested. To prevent panic, the evidence of the conspiracy has been released and distributed among the public, who are shocked but also relieved that the coup was prevented. However, the fact that Saigo was a samurai, and that samurai were heavily involved in his plan, has cast a shadow of suspicion upon them. With the samurai already weakened by the government’s emphasis on military modernization, radicals are beginning to vilify them as arch-reactionary parasites, infuriating the bushi. Worst of all, it is feared that not all conspirators were identified and may still be at large…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP70.T;A Republic of Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP70.D;Though the republic was built on a fragile basis of cooperation between liberal scholars and ideologically diverse samurai, it had been hoped that this unlikely coalition could be as successful in peace as it was in war. Sadly, this was not to be. A famous samurai named Hozumi Takemori, once seen as a moderating influence among the bushi, has moved sharply to the right since the republic’s establishment. Fearful of liberalism eroding Japanese culture, he has decided that the fate of the nation cannot be trusted to intellectuals. With the support of samurai across the nation, especially those within the military and the rest of the government, Hozumi has marched on the capital and proclaimed himself to be the new president. He has already issued executive orders resurrecting State Shinto, banning political parties, and implementing various other policies which have horrified liberals. Yet reactionaries and even conservatives seem to adore him, none more so than the bushi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP71.D;Like the bakemono of Shintoism, the fickle shapeshifting spirits of terrible power, Japan has morphed from a republic into something beyond recognition. The growing tensions between liberal intellectuals and the ideologically diverse samurai proved irreconcilable, and the bushi have decided to act. Prince Fujitaka, a Shinto zealot and youngest brother of former Prince Regent Mitsuhito, fled into exile after the republican victory in the civil war. However, after being contacted by conspiratorial bushi, he has returned in secret. During a meeting of the legislature, the bushi overpowered the guards and burst into the chamber, slaughtering all within. Minutes later, Fujitaka entered Kyoto in a grand parade escorted by the highest members of the military, heading straight to the Imperial Palace where he was enthroned as Emperor-Shogun Kan’ei. /n /n “Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for the Broad Leniency given unto us as your Eternal Leader.

FJAP1.D;Father Francisco Garrupe was a Portuguese Jesuit priest who helped spread Catholicism to Japan. Prior to his arrival in 1639, his mentor, Joao Ferreira, was rumored to have been executed by the Shimabara daimyo, Arima Yukinaga, and Garrupe infiltrated Shimabara to investigate. After narrowly escaping arrest, he found a samurai named Kirino Hanjiro, who was himself a Kirishitan (secret Christian). Hanjiro confirmed Ferreira’s death before sneaking out of Shimabara to inform Shogun Oda Nobunaga of the situation. Garrupe was soon then captured, tortured, and martyred by Yukinaga. However, Nobunaga, upon hearing Hanjiro’s story, forced Yukinaga to abdicate. The daimyo’s heir Ieyasu, moved by Garrupe’s actions, converted to Catholicism and spread the faith across Shimabara. Many Japanese Catholics have pressed for Garrupe’s canonization, and now the Holy Father has finally seen fit to declare him a saint. Joyous crowds greeted the news in Nagasaki - a port leased by Ieyasu to Spain, and a center of Asian Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW1.T;Voyage of the Dingyuan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW1.D;Marshall Yeng Futing is the rightful leader of both our humble archipelago of Fang Hú and of Qingqiu. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. Although he had been sure of being welcomed by fellow opponents of the Sanbao leviathan, no city opened its harbor to him, and so he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. Futing brought peace and stability to his new realm of Fang Hú, which he has governed ever since. One of his first decrees was an embargo against traitorous Qingqiu, but last night a Qinqiuese ship, the Dingyuan, attempted to smuggle goods into Fang Hú! Fortunately the virtuous Fleet-in-Exile drove them off, but this is yet another reminder that we must not forget our dangerous position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW2.D;Hawaii is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, distant from most trade routes. For the past few decades, the islands have been ruled as “Fang Hú” by “Marshall” Yeng Futing, a treasonous Qingqiuese naval officer who took command of the rebel fleet in the aftermath of the War of Unification in 1812, then fled to the islands and brutally subjugated them. While some in Qingqiu have argued that our nation has a moral duty to end Futing’s reign, the remoteness of the islands and their lack of strategic value have made them a low priority. However, the nature of their government means that they continue to grab headlines on occasion. This time, a merchant ship named the Dingyuan attempted to anchor off the coast of Fang Hú to conduct business there, only to be chased away by the outsized Fang Hú navy. This incident has once again brought Fang Hú into national discourse, and while public attention will probably fade, the situation remains a nagging issue for Qingqiu’s foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW3.D;The Kalanikupule family, long the rulers of the island of Maui, were, like most native dynasties of Fang Hú, reduced to mere figureheads under the close eye of the Marshall’s forces. Kept under house arrest and tight surveillance except during major ceremonies, control of the islands’ “ruling” families strengthened Futing’s rule. It appears, however, that these security measures have finally failed. Last night, after what was, according to an interrogated household servant, months of planning, the Kalanikupules gathered their most precious belongings and subdued the guards posted to the night watch of their state-furnished palace. Stealing out into the night, they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship, which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified. According to the lighthouse keeper who reported the incident, the ship that bore them was flying the Scandinavian flag! This has led to rumors swirling that the whole thing was a Scandinavian plot…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.A;Fetch the guards that were supposed to watch them - and a firing squad while you're at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.T;Flight of the House Kalanikupule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.D;A strange tale has reached us from our Christiana colony. A few days ago, one of our Eastern Indies Fleet’s ships, the Hansa, was reported missing, yet Admiral Christian Knuth, head of the Fleet, seemed oddly unconcerned. The whole colony was astonished when the Hansa returned yesterday bearing an entire Jarlsbergsøyenese royal family! Apparently, Protestant missionaries approached Knuth months ago, describing how they had secretly converted members of the Kalanikupule dynasty of Maui Island to Christianity. However, the major families of Jarlsbergsøyene, also known as Fang Hú or Hawaii, were under house arrest by the island’s despot, a rogue Qingqiuese admiral named Yeng Futing. Knuth secretly dispatched the Hansa to aide the Jarlsbergsøyenese in an uprising against Futing. It arrived too late, and the uprising failed, but the Hansa was still able to rescue the dynasty. Some ministers are shocked at Knuth’s recklessness, though others observe that we could use this to our advantage by installing them as rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.A;Very well, don't court marshal him - yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.T;Death of the Marshall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.D;Yeng Futing, great Marshall of Qingqiu and the island of Fang Hú has died. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. With no city revolting to welcome his ships, he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification wars. The Qingqiuese admiral decimated the warring chiefs and their retinues, establishing an oligarchy where only the Qingqiuese officers had power. Futing claimed to be the only true ruler of Qingqiu, although no one took him seriously. His unopposed rule lasted more than 50 years, and already it seems that both the native Hawaians who have become increasingly radicalized due to the harsh treatments imposed by the Chinese oligarchy, and the Qingqiuese settlers want some change in the islands. One wonders how the designated successor of Yeng, Zhang Chen, will handle this new era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.A;A drama in the heart of the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.T;Cabinet Discusses Jarlsbergsøyene;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.D;With the death of the notorious Marshall Yeng Futing, our ministers and military officers have begun to debate whether we should intervene in  Jarlsbergsøyene. Admiral Knuth’s actions have ensured that we have a justification, should we want one : placing the Kalanikupule dynasty on the throne of a united archipelago. The larger question is whether doing so might attract unwanted attention. Qingqiu has always seen “Fang Hú” as part of its diplomatic sphere, albeit a renegade one, and decades of Qingqiuese rule have created a notable minority which wields tremendous political and economic power, so they might also intervene. But, our admirals point to a third contender : the Empire of Japan. Japan’s ambitions in the Pacific are well known, and Futing had occasionally allowed Japanese traders to conduct business in Fang Hú, so they have established a small presence there as well. While Japan is currently unstable, it is probable that they would react if we moved against Jarlsbergsøyene. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.A;Drop the matter, it isn't worth our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.B;We must liberate Jarlsbergsøyene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.T;Marshal Chen Supports Qingqiuese Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.D;With the lack of any forthcoming Scandinavian intervention against Fang Hú, Marshal Zhang Chen assembled the high-ranking military officers and most influential landlords at his palace today, and made a stunning announcement : he intends to convince Qingqiu to annex us! He followed this thunderbolt by explaining his motives – if Fang Hú joins Qingqiu on its own terms, Chen said, then they could obtain Qingqiu’s protection while presenting themselves as a ready-made administration for Sanbao to co-opt. Thus, the ruling elite could preserve much of their power and no longer live in fear of foreign encroachment. This explanation soothed most attendees’ nerves, though the military is restless at the thought of surrendering our independence to the nation that Futing spend fifty years railing against. Still, word has already leaked out into the public, and most Qingqiuese settlers seem to approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.A;It's time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.T;Fang Hú Requests Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.D;Our government was caught off guard when Marshall Zhang Chen, the newest ruler of Fang Hú, sent an envoy to us to request to join our nation! Apparently, the measure has gained rapid support in the archipelago following Futing’s death, and a recent incident with Scandinavia convinced Chen that foreign protection is necessary to safeguard Fang Hú. With a powerful Qingqiuese settler population already existing in Fang Hú, it would probably be simple to integrate them into our country. Several expansionist MPs have quickly drafted a bill of annexation and ensured its swift passage through the legislature, and today Fang Hú became our newest state. The mood was not entirely jubilant, however, as dark rumors have emerged that the Empire of Japan may seek to interfere…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.A;We shall sign the bill into law and celebrate our new Pacific friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.B;A tremendous gesture, but we cannot risk Japan's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.T;Hojo is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.D;To the astonishment of our ministers, both Scandinavia and Qingqiu have shied away from taking control of the Hojo Islands, despite being presented opportunities to do so. Qingqiu is reported to have even voted down a bill of annexation! With no other option and fearing for the future of the archipelago, Marshall Chen has reluctantly approached us and requested our protection. Though he and much of his family will maintain positions of influence across the islands, we have effectively gained control of Hojo without firing a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.A;A bloodless victory is the most sublime kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.B;Those islands are clearly more trouble than they're worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.T;The Hojo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.D;The archipelago of Hojo – known to westerners as Jarlsbergsøyene, to Chinese speakers as Fang Hú, and to natives as Hawaii – has been the object of small Japanese interest for decades. Japan was a major trading partner in Fang Hú and sanctioned by its mercurial Qinqiuese dictator, the rogue admiral Yeng Futing. While our merchant activity was strictly regulated by Futing and his oligarchs, we nevertheless managed to build up a trading presence there. Now, however, our position has been threatened, as the nation of Qingqiu recently passed a bill of Fang Húese annexation! If we want to avoid surrendering our position in Hojo – and potentially opening up nearby Pacific islands to Qingqiuese colonization – we must act swiftly to oppose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.A;We shall not bow to a nation as lowly as Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.B;Let us reconcile with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.T;Japan Declares War over Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.D;When our forefathers smashed the Xiazhou Expedition, the Japanese invasion of Qingqiu, in 4528 Huángdì year (1821 AD by the European calendar), they had warned us that this was not the end – that Japan might one day return. Now, those fears have been proven correct, albeit in a way they likely couldn’t have anticipated. Our annexation of the Fang Hú Islands has provoked the gluttonous Japanese so severely that they have declared war upon us, with the seizure of Fang Hú as their goal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.A;They shall meet the same fate as before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.T;Japan Forfeits Fang Hú;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.D;It seems that the Japanese are even more cowardly than we thought. Though they have issued strenuous diplomatic protests over our annexation of Fang Hú, there has not been any sign of them taking military action against us. The islands are ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.A;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.T;The End of the Oligarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.D;Yeng Futing had always insisted on a firm hand when dealing with the native peoples of Fang Hú, declaring that they would seize any moment of weakness to rise up, even as he demeaned them as primitive savages. It seems that he was right to be paranoid. Just before dawn this morning, a strike force of three Scandinavian men-of-war pulled into Hilo harbor, cannons blazing. In the confusion of the assault, Scandinavian marines travelled north by boat away from the heat of the fighting, then made landfall and snuck into the city. Just as Marshall Chen was informed of the invasion, the marines – led by Prince 'Iolani Kalanikupule – fought their way into the palace and took Chen by surprise as he was escaping. Chen died in a shootout in the palace gardens, and soon Scandinavian reinforcements arrived to secure the capital. News of the invasion spread across the islands, igniting a deluge of native uprisings which have shattered the Qingqiuese dominion. 'Iolani has been enthroned as King of a united Hawaii, backed by Scandinavian firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.A;Aloha, Hawaii!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.T;Pro-Scandinavian Coup in Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.D;Traders operating in the South China Sea had brought back rumors of a Scandinavian plot to restore native Hawaiian rule in Fang Hú, and it seems that these rumors were correct. Scandinavian warships blasted their way into the capital city of Hilo, shattering the vaunted Fleet-in-Exile and allowing a team of marines led by a Hawaiian prince to execute Marshall Zhang Chen and initiate an archipelago-wide revolution against the Qingqiuese settlers. The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King ‘Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Expansionists across Qingqiu are already calling upon us to save the Qingqiuese of the islands, and rescue them from what can only be the prelude to full Scandinavian annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.A;The Qingqiuese flag shall fly over the Pacific!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW15.T;Pro-Scandinavian Coup in Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW15.D;Officials in Osaka, during their patrols of the Scandinavian part of the foreign merchant district, have overheard rumors of a Scandinavian plot to restore native Hawaiian rule in Fang Hú, and it seems that these rumors were correct. Scandinavian warships blasted their way into the capital city of Hilo, shattering the Fleet-in-Exile and allowing a team of marines led by a Hawaiian prince to execute Marshall Zhang Chen and initiate an archipelago-wide revolution against the Qingqiuese settlers. The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King ‘Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Our traders have already begun returning to Japan, demanding that the government take action to defend both Japanese economic rights and our national honor, and the navy seems quite sympathetic to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW16.T;The Jarlsbergsøyenese Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW16.D;Prince – now King – ‘Iolani was quite happy with our government’s vast amount of military aid supplied to enthrone him as the first native monarch of the Jarlsbergsøyenese islands, but perhaps he should have read the fine print of our agreement a bit more closely. A Scandinavian “resident” has been appointed to oversee the Kingdom’s affairs, Scandinavian merchants have been granted extraordinary privileges throughout the archipelago, and, since the Fang Hú military was largedly arrested or killed during the anti-Qingqiuese revolution, the only truly organized military presence on the islands is the Scandinavian military. With no sign of foreign interference in sight, there is little reason to maintain the fiction of native rule any longer. ‘Iolani may keep his title, informally, but he and his dynasty shall once more be figureheads within the new Jarlsbergsøyenese protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Qingqiuese have expressed outrage at our “invasion” of Fang Hú – never mind that it was done to overthrow the regime that had been their enemy for over half a century. Qingqiu has already laid claim to the islands, based upon the Qinqqiuese settler population (or what’s left of it after the native uprising), and is mobilizing its military for an invasion of the archipelago. It seems that we must fight for our newest acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW24.T;The Treaty of Honolulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW24.D;Though Qingqiu sought to restore the settlers’ dominion over Hawaii, though Scandinavia schemed to deprive it of its liberty, though Japan made plans to conquer it, King ‘Iolani Kalanikupule has outsmarted them all. Knowing that the only thing more tempting than a subjugated Hawaii was denying their rivals a victory, he bet on all three powers’ mutual distrust – and won. In the Conference of Honolulu, attended by all three powers as well as the King and his council, and which shall go down in the annals of diplomatic history, Hawaii has become a truly neutral nation. Though the King has renounced the nation’s right to wage war or to enter military alliances, in return he has obtained international recognition of Hawaii as a nation safeguarded by international law. Furthermore, Japan, Qingqiu, and Scandinavia have all renounced their claims to the islands, and have mutually guaranteed its independence. As the signatories put pen to page, King ‘Iolani declared that Hawaii and its guarantors were now an ohana, a family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

claim_xiazhou_desc;In 10 Komei (1820 AD by the Western calendar), the city-state of San Bao sought to centralize all of Qingqiu under its control. The chaos that this provoked inspired Japan to attempt to seize the coastal region of Xiazhou. The expedition was a disaster – our logistics proved totally inadequate, every European power with any influence in Arcadia aided the Qingqiuans against us, and the daring attempt by Admiral Yusumoto’s marines to seize the harbor in preparation for taking the city itself led to a vicious street battle in which his whole unit was annihilated. The wounds of this shame upon both the honor of our military and the honor of our nation have never healed. Now, however, the situation has changed. Arcadia is divided and Europe is eating itself alive, whereas Japan is stronger than ever. The time has come to take revenge upon Qingqiu and finish what we started.

It is in that infernal presidential palace, the High Castle of Sanbao, where the greatest enemy of the Japanese people lies in wait. We can tolerate the schemes of Qingqiu no longer! The time has come to take up arms and slay the beast across the ocean, to consign Qingqiu itself to the graveyard of history. Their lands are rich and abundant, and our settlers shall make great use of them. As for the existing residents, well…we shall have to find some solution for them. But, enough of the future!

However, the limited range of Japanese vessels restricted our overseas administrative capacity. The acquisition of the Hojo Islands, however, has gone a long way towards fixing this problem. As such, the IJN has now put forth a bold plan to seize the far-flung Amerigan archipelago of the Galapagos Islands, known to us as the Kamejima Islands (both meaning “Tortoise Islands”). Though most famous for their spectacular flora and fauna, control of Kamejima would give us an outpost in the southern Pacific and serve as a base to further expand our influence in Ameriga and Arcadia. It just so happens that a small Japanese merchant ship is scheduled to pass by the Galapagos on its way to an Amerigan port.

So long as it is beyond our control, neither our maritime traffic nor our southern islands will be truly safe. Before we can embark on any grander foreign adventures, we must first secure Takasago. The island is currently held by a foreign power, which may simplify matters. Since they hold no ethnic ties to any of Takasago’s inhabitants, we believe that they may be induced to sell the island to us for the right price – and if they refuse, we always have recourse to force. Let us take the first step towards our destiny and acquire Takasago!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

establish_three_kami_shrine_desc;After Kanakagawa was officially integrated into Japan, three Shinto deities (Okunitama, Okuninushi, and Sukunahikona) were enshrined as the patrons of the Kanakagawan reclamation. Now that we have taken control of Takasago, some Shinto priests and religious-minded military officers have proposed to bring this triune union of Shinto deities to Takasago as well. The plan calls for the creation of a shrine atop Jiantan Mountain, which shall allow the three divine kami to oversee the entire city of Taipei – a formidable expression of Japan’s spiritual and political power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
purchase_brunei_title;Purchase Brunei;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
purchase_brunei_desc;The small Spanish colony of Brunei holds great strategic value. Situated on the northern coast of the East Indies, its proximity to both the Rusun Islands and mainland southeast Asia makes it a vital port for any power seeking to establish a naval presence in the region – such as ourselves. However, it has begun to fall into disrepair over the years, as the Spanish authorities find themselves without either the money or the energy to revitalize the region. Let us offer to take it off their hands, for the right price – and if they refuse, we shall simply conquer it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_rusun_conquest_title;The Case for Rusun;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_rusun_conquest_desc;The island of Rusun, known to the Chinese as Liusung and to the Europeans as Lusong, the northern end of the archipelago known to the Europeans as the Christianer Islands, is of vital interest to Japan! Its proximity to Takasago makes it the logical next line of defense, its resources would be of substantial value to our economy, and its acquisition would open the way to our consolidation of the whole archipelago. Yet Rusun is currently held by a foreign power, one who is not inclined to part with it. This cannot stand! Rusun must be Japanese – but the Japanese people seem to be unaware of Rusun’s importance. Let us initiate a nationwide campaign to promote the necessity of Rusun’s acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
taking_the_manioras_title;Conquest of the Manioras;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
taking_the_manioras_desc;The islands of the Manioras are Scandinavia’s easternmost colonial holding. They hold rich farmland, excellent for both agriculture and the keeping of animals, not to mention their status as a local trade nexus. Now that we hold Rusun, however, the Scandinavian presence in the Manioras has become a strategic liability for us. Japan’s destiny is to unite the archipelago under our wise and benevolent rule – the rule of an Asian people, not some European barbarians! Scandinavia must either relinquish the Manioras or face our wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_kyowakai_society_title;Establish the Kyowakai Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_kyowakai_society_desc;The Kyowakai (“Concordia”) Society is a group which seeks to bring businessmen, political theorists, and military officers together in the support of Japan’s interests in continental Asia, chiefly China. The men of the Kyowakai Society argue that China’s state of disorder, compared to Japan’s newfound unity, is proof that the Chinese have lost the ability to maintain a harmonious and peaceful realm. Moreover, the intrusion of European Great Powers into China’s economy (and, lately, their coastal territory) is a threat to the Asian balance of power and to Japan’s financial stability. The Kyowakai Society seeks to advance Japanese hegemony as the solution to these problems – whether by diplomatic pressure, propaganda, or subterfuge, they shall stop at nothing to secure our position in China. For the greater good, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consolidate_chinese_trade_title;Consolidate Chinese Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consolidate_chinese_trade_desc;The Kyowakai Society has informed us that they believe the time is right to strike another blow for Japan’s control of Chinese trade. Through the newspapers, politicians, merchants, and agents at the society’s disposal, they will engineer a burst of public support for our cause which will culminate in an international incident between us and a foreign power that holds a vulnerable Chinese city. The international community might be suspicious, but it shall give us a solid justification for war. However, the sensitive nature of these activities means that we will have to wait some time for attention to die down before repeating this plan again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call_nagoya_conference_title;Call the Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call_nagoya_conference _trade_desc;Tensions in China are reaching a fever pitch. With European powers continuing to jockey for influence, not to mention the shifting political situation within China itself, East Asian trade is growing unstable. To solve this crisis, let us convene a diplomatic conference in the city of Nagoya for all of the powers involved in the China trade. The solution which Japan shall propose? Simple : as the foremost Asian power, one built upon the foundation of democracy and with few stakes in Europe’s affairs, we are the most reliable guardian of East Asian trade and thus should be recognized as its guarantor. Obviously, this would necessitate our taking control of the Chinese cities most involved in the East Asian economy, but this is strictly to prevent further violence. Suffice to say, this is likely to be a difficult concept for the Great Powers to accept, but so long as we publicize the concept we should have a solid foundation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_title;The Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_trade_desc;Sangoku (lit. “Three Countries”) is a concept which has existed in Japanese philosophy from before contact with Europe. It identifies Honshu (the largest island in Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India) as part of a single spiritual and cultural continuum. However, the phrase has begun to be used by Japanese political scientists to describe something more complex, namely Japan’s obligation to culturally unite Asia and dismantle European colonialism throughout the continent. These “pan-Asianists” argue that Japan, having thrown off the shackles of theocratic monarchy and feudalism while still maintaining our unique national character, has achieved a level of cultural development above that of Europe. Therefore, we ought to take the lead and guide Asia into common prosperity. Naturally, adopting this as government policy will outrage Europe – but, let them howl! Asia is for Asians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_southern_embassy_title;The Southern Embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_southern_embassy_desc;The “Southern Embassy” is one of Japan’s most venerable diplomatic offices, the one located in the overseas Chinese state of Zhourao. One of the most distant outposts of Japanese trade, Japanese-Zhourao relations have been complicated by both the distance involved and the cultural disconnection between our societies. Yet as both Japan and Zhourao begin to recognize a greater sense of national responsibility, perhaps we could find a common purpose in securing stability within the Pacific Ocean. We shall attempt to form a military alliance with Zhourao – if they accept then it may enable us to greatly increase our influence in their nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_title;Propose the Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_desc;Japan has maintained diplomatic and economic connections with the southern overseas Chinese state of Zhourao for centuries, but most of these ties have been of little importance. However, the arrival of a European colonial power onto the continent and its occupation of the region of Zuharra has cast our relations with Zhourao in a new light. Our military believes that we may be able to sway the Zhourao government into forming a military alliance for the purpose of driving out the Europeans and securing Zuharra for Zhourao. If successful, then we may be able to ingratiate ourselves within the Zhourao military, as well as its political and economic elite. Perhaps those connections could, in turn, open up the possibility of establishing a more...friendly Zhourao regime. Let us draw in a group of visiting Zhourao diplomats into the city of Kagoshima for a series of secret discussions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
puppet_zhourao_title;The Zhourao Chrysanthemum Society Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
puppet_zhourao_desc;Our liberation of Zuharra has made Japan quite celebrated in Zhourao. However, it has not only brought us popularity – it has also given us the chance to make valuable connections with Zhourao’s military, political, and economic establishment. We have drawn the most Japanophilic  Zhourao elite into a single organization, the Chrysanthemum Society (named for a flower often associated with Japan). This Society has extolled Japan’s virtues in public, but in private has been preparing for a coup to create a government more favorable to Japan’s interests. In exchange, all members of the Society shall find themselves handsomely rewarded after the revolution. We have just received word that the plan is ready to be put into action. Of course, if it fails, the Zhourao people will be outraged. and we shall likely be drawn into open warfare with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_zhourao_title;The Lands of Red and Gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_zhourao_desc;Zhourao is a land which at first glance seems to be barren, but which in truth holds tremendous riches. Whoever possesses Zhourao shall find wealth beyond imagination, if they can endure its hazards. Yet Zhourao is currently possessed by a dishonorable and undeserving people, barbaric Chinese settlers who have squatted upon the land for generations, and who have cobbled together a feeble edifice that they dare to call a government. The time has come for the great Japanese people to sweep this flotsam back into the sea where it came from, and take the mighty southern continent for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.T;Victory in Xiazhou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.D;At last, the humiliation of the past has been avenged! Qingqiu has been driven from Xiazhou and they have finally conceded that the war is lost. The Qingqiuans have signed a peace treaty ceding Xiazhou to us, and the only question now is what to do with it. Hokkaigan has petitioned us to place the area under their control, citing their geographic proximity and the history of Hokkaiganese fishermen, hunters, and traders ranging south into Xiazhou (one of the sources for our claim on the area in the first place). However, a few more…cautious members of the military have proposed maintaining direct rule over Xiazhou. They argue that, should Qingqiu retaliate or Hokkaigan repudiate their allegiance in the future, having a Japanese garrison in the area would be preferable. Still, these men are a tiny minority and most officials agree that Hokkaigan should receive the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.A;Transfer Xiazhou to Hokkaigan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.B;Hokkaigan is untrustworthy, maintain direct rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.T;The Fate of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.D;As the last guns fall silent across western Arcadia, the banner of Qingqiu is nowhere to be seen – the Rising Sun dominates all, from the verdant forests of Xiazhou to the vast city of Sanbao. The question of the hour is how we shall administer these newly conquered lands. The current plan is to create a client state known as “Dayan” to control the interior of Qingqiu, controlled by Japanese officials but employing sufficiently vetted and obedient Qingqiuans, one of whom would rule Dayan as a dictator in our name. We would retain direct control of the Qingqiuese coast. More extreme ministers, however, believe that relying on Qingqiuans in any capacity is both dangerous and beneath our dignity, and demand total annexation of Qingqiu. The Imperial Army has expressed concerns about being able to effectively police the eastern frontier should direct rule be fully imposed, but the final decision lies with the Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.A;Konnichiwa, Dayan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC2.T;All of Qingqiu shall be ours and ours alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.T;A Crisis in Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.D;Lately, we have been deluged by complaints from government officials in the former Qingqiu. The exact nature of these complaints varies – insufficient resources, poor communication, rudimentary infrastructure, and an unruly local populace – but the conclusion is that we simply cannot efficiently administer the Qingqiuan interior. The work required to fix these problems could take decades but we are already running out of time. The tone of these complaints has become fearful and alarmed, and the situation in the Arcadian frontier has become critical. Entire towns have ceased reporting in, military outposts have come under attack from well-organized Qingqiuan militias, and patrols that head too far into the Mingxing Mountains have not returned. §RMany ministers believe that the creation of Dayan is the only way to prevent a total collapse of law and order.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.A;We must create Dayan to prevent chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.B;Have the eastern bureaucrats tried whining less?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.T;Anarchy in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.D;The worst fears of the Imperial Japanese Army have been realized : Qingqiu has burst into open rebellion. Ex-Qingqiuan general Hong Shikai has emerged from hiding in the Mingxing Mountains and declared the Second Qingqiuan Federal Republic with himself as its provisional president. This announcement triggered a cascade of uprisings across the frontier, which have totally overwhelmed our administration. Region after region has been seized, either by Shikai’s militias, or by insurrectionary bands of farmers and miners who have pledged varying degrees of loyalty to Shikai. Our garrisons have had to fall back to the western coast as a tsunami of resurgent Qingqiuan nationalism threatens to sweep us back into the Pacific. We are preparing a response to this calamity, but such preparations take time, and meanwhile, Shikai is making his own preparations…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC4.T;Yet more filth to eradicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.T;The Third Japanese-Qingqiuan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.D;Japan’s aspirations to conquer all of Qingqiu without compromise has allowed a Qingqiuan insurgency to morph into a full-fledged revolution. General Hong Shikai leads an insurrectionary army towards Sanbao, seeking to drive Japan out of the coast and reclaim Qingqiu’s lost lands. If Japan were to be defeated at this juncture, the whole Empire could be placed in jeopardy. The stage is set for what may either be Qingqiu’s resurrection or its funeral dirge. Western Arcadia burns with the fires of war once again as Shikai marches to the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC5.A;Death to Qingqiu! Tennhoku Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.T;Victory over Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.D;The brave warriors of Japan have won yet another glorious victory! Shikai’s aspirations and his armies lie shattered across western Arcadia, having fallen upon the blades of the Imperial Army. As we bury our dead and resume our administration of the frontier, we are once again confronted with the question of administration. Many believe that this rebellion is proof that the creation of Dayan is necessary for stability. Some go so far as to argue that we should further decentralize by creating a colonial dominion in Hokkaigan as well. Of course, the hardliners argue once again that only Japan can be trusted to rule these places, and it must be said that the insurgency and subsequent revolt have not inspired confidence in the trustworthiness of the Qingqiuans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.A;Dayan will bring stability to this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC6.B;Dayan and Hokkaigan, loyal daughters of Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC7.T;Stalemate in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC7.D;Though both Japan and Qingqiu have struggled mightily to claim victory, neither side has been able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. With no other option, the Tenno has consented to the signing of an armistice with the rebel leader, General Hong Shikai. Shikai shall administer the frontier as an independent Qingqiu, while the western coast shall remain in Japan’s possession. As many Qingqiuans depart to seek shelter in Shikai’s resurrected nation, the Tenno leaves Arcadia behind and turns his minds to other, hopefully more fruitful pursuits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC7.A;At least we still have Sanbao…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.T;The Rebirth of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.D;To the astonishment of all, Qingqiu has destroyed the Japanese invaders! Just when all hope seemed lost, General Hong Shikai arose from his stronghold in Mingxingshan to liberate the Qingqiuan people. Now the armies of the so-called “Emperor” of Japan have been thoroughly cleansed from the nation, and their feeble colonial administration has crumbled. Shikai has entered Sanbao, the streets thronged by thousands upon thousands of cheering citizens even as certain neighborhoods still smolder from the fighting. Much work must be done to heal the nation from this unprecedented ordeal, but all children of Zhongguo may rest easy tonight knowing that Qingqiu has once again defeated Japan’s mad aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC8.A;Long live Shikai! Long live Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.T;The Galapagos Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.D;Japanese natural scientists have taken quite an interest in the Galapagos Islands lately, making all sorts of geographical surveys of the area. This has begun to unnerve our navy, which suspects that these scientific missions are a pretext for more sinister purposes. A naval patrol was heading to the Galapagos to set up an outpost there when word was received of a sinking Japanese ship. It appears that the SS Yamasa, a merchant vessel bound for Tawantinsuyu, suffered a mysterious explosion near the islands. While much of the crew was able to evacuate and take shelter on the islands until they could be rescued, the Japanese press has seized upon the event with jingoistic fury. Declaring that our nation sunk the Yamasa with a mine, war-minded men across Japan are calling for nothing less than the Japanese conquest of the Galapagos Islands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC9.A;This is insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.T;The Andagoyan Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.D;Ever since Japan’s seizure of the Galapagos Islands, rumors have been swirling in Andagoya of the presence of Japanese spies. The Japanese commercial presence in Andagoya has certainly increased. Furthermore, Juan Eligio Mallarino, a notorious Andagoyan rail baron, has hosted numerous meetings with Japanese businessmen and has taken an attractive Japanese mistress. These threads have finally come together into a full-blown conspiracy. This morning, a small army of private soldiers loyal to Mallarino stormed the city of Balboa, whereupon Mallarino appeared at the steps of Balboa city hall and declared the independence of the Republic of Andagoya with himself as provisional president! Japan has immediately recognized Andagoyan independence and has pledged to dispatch a “protection” force to Andagoya at once. Our own forces are ready to crush this rebellion but if we do so then Japan will probably declare war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC10.A;Damn the Japanese, Mallarino is a traitor and must be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC13.D;Japan’s recent occupation of Andagoya came as a shock to nations around the world, but this has proven to merely be the prelude to even more astonishing news. The Japanese foreign ministry has published a declaration signed by the Japanese Emperor himself, declaring a ban on all attempts to construct a canal through the Isthmus of Andagoya! Numerous reasons were cited, from “the potential to cause irreversible harm to the local environment” to “the unpredictable consequences upon Andagoyan society from geographic bifurcation.” Stock markets across Europe and Arcadia have tumbled as investors frantically reevaluate their assets in the Western Hemisphere, while politicians rage against this unilateral action by the Empire of Japan to strangle Arcadian commerce. The door to scientific and commercial progress in southern Arcadia seems to have been decisively closed, held firm by the iron grip of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Andagoyan canal project was seen as a dire threat to the Quechua economy, but now the ships of the world shall continue to visit the ports of Tawantinsuyu on their journeys around Ameriga. While Arcadians are enraged at this unilateral action by Japan to strangle their commerce, the merchants of Tawantinsuyu raise a glass to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC14.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Issues Andagoyan Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.D;Our presence in Andagoya has infuriated many countries across Arcadia and Europe, and $FROMCOUNTRY_GET_NAME$ in particular. They have denounced our actions as “unilateralism of the knife and the gun,” and “the international equivalent of a bandit’s toll.” Now, they have moved beyond libel and slander and graduated to serious threats. Their diplomatic representative has presented an ultimatum, approved by the highest levels of their government, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Japanese government and military assets from Andagoya, the exile of Mallarino, and the establishment of a free Andagoyan government. Given their prior rhetoric, this is a ludicrous hypocrisy, but the specter of war with their nation is one which merits serious consideration. Some more pessimistic observers have gone so far as to deem Andagoya “indefensible.";;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.A;Prepare a white kimono for our foreign minister...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.B;The only thing “indefensible” is their cowardly bluster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.D;The Japanese resisted our demand vigorously, but in the end they proved to be a paper tiger. Their forces have disappeared from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom they installed to rule Andagoya, has fled into exile to escape the wrath of the people that he sought to lord over. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.A;All’s well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.T;The $COUNTRY$-Japanese War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.D;Japan has categorically refused any attempts to even discuss the matter of their occupation of Andagoya or the moratorium on canal construction. They have stated that it is a “matter of national security and economic survival,” and reiterate that the possible damage a canal might cause locally and to the Amerigan and the Pacific economies is too great a risk to take. The public has already been fanned into a fury with lurid reports of Japanese abuses towards the Andagoyans, so now, there is no turning back : the $COUNTRY$-Japanese War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.A;Andagoya shall be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.D;The Japanese occupation of Andagoya has finally been defeated! The last remnants of their forces have withdrawn from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom the Japanese installed, was caught while trying to flee to Tawantinsuyu disguised as a peddler. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. Its first order of business was to place Mallarino on trial for treason - he was convicted, and subsequently executed by firing squad. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC18.T;The End of the Andagoya Canal Moratorium;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC18.D;When Japan seized Andagoya and banned the construction of a canal across the isthmus, the world reacted with varying degrees of shock. European and Arcadian merchants were outraged, while Amerigans seemed rather pleased. However, it was $FROMCOUNTRY$ which reacted most severely : they issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw from Andagoya, and, after prevailed in the crisis, have asserted diplomatic hegemony over the region. As the Japanese Imperial Court reels from this catastrophic loss of face, it seems inevitable that $FROMCOUNTRY$ shall soon commence construction of the canal which Japan expended so much blood and treasure striving to prevent from being built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC19.T;Japan Offers to Buy Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.D;Japan’s interest in the island of Formosa is well known. Positioned close to the Japanese Home Islands, its possession has long been held as a requirement by nearly all Japanese expansionists and foreign policy advocates. Japan has now come forward with a request to purchase the island from us. They are offering a sizable sum, but the colony’s strategic position cannot be ignored, and its acquisition will not only strengthen Japan but also embolden it to embark on further expansionist projects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC20.T;Japan Offers to Buy Brunei;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.D;As Japan continues to build its colonial empire, our holding in Brunei has come to their attention. They seek a port in the East Indies, and have thus come forward with an offer to buy the whole Brunei colony. While our nation has sadly seen its own international presence decline, we might be able to use this opportunity to free ourselves of an unprofitable colony and infuse some money into our coffers. On the other hand, this will inevitably strengthen Japan and may open the door for further Japanese expansion into the East Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.A;We need the money, do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.B;Brunei is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC21.D;Our efforts to purchase Spain’s Brunei colony were successful. The territory has now come under our control and our position in the East Indies has been strengthened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC21.A;And the Rising Sun illuminates yet more of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC22.T;Spain Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC23.T;Rusun is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC23.D;At last, the northernmost part of the land the Europeans call the Christianer Archipelago has come under our control! Though this marks yet another victory for Japan, it seems that the political attention of our nation is already drifting to other places. Rusun may not command the same level of focus as it recently has, but it shall still remain an important part of our colonial empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC24.T;Japan Demands the Maniolas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.D;For years, Asian experts in our nation have watched the steady expansion of Japan’s colonial empire in Asia with growing alarm. Alas, it appears that their vigilance was warranted, for Japan has now seen fit to place our territories in the Christianer Islands in their sights. An ultimatum has been delivered to our government by Japan, demanding nothing less than the full and immediate cession of the Maniolas under threat of war. The close proximity of the colonies to Japan would make them quite difficult to defend, but can our nation really afford such a monumental humiliation as to cede the whole area without a fight? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.A;We don’t have a choice…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
JPC24.B;To Hell with Japan, Scandinavia is not dead yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.T;The Nordic-Japanese War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.D;Scandinavia has flatly refused to surrender so much as a single Christianer Island to us! Diplomacy having failed, war is now inevitable. The whole world watches with bated breath as Japan squares off against a true European power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.A;We shall crush them easily!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.T;Japanese Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.D;Many deemed it impossible. Many dismissed the notion that a people as primitive, backwards, or inferior as the Japanese could ever challenge Scandinavian might. Today, many people have been proven wrong. Japan has bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our holdings in the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Scandinavia : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by an Asian one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.A;Scandinavia’s future grows ever dimmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.T;Scandinavian Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.D;The worst fears of our nation, of our people, have been proven correct. Scandinavia, for all the rumors of their feebleness, has triumphed. They have bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our claims to the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Japan : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by a European one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.A;Have we angered the kami?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.T;Formation of the Kyowakai Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.D;The Kyowakai, or “Concordia,” Society has been formed in Japan. Despite its innocuous-sounding name, the group exists to advance Japan’s imperialist interests against China in the name of social progress and economic development. With a growing array of lobbyists, sympathetic media outlets, agents provocateur, and wealthy supporters, the Kyowakai Society will stop at nothing to drive the spear of Japanese imperialism into the bosom of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.A;Yet more suffering on the horizon for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.T;The Kyowakai Society Targets Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.D;The Kyowakai Society has turned their propaganda machine towards us, seeking to push Japan into conflict to penetrate our markets. They slander us in their newspapers, libel us with their politicians, and infiltrate us with their agents. Matters came to a head recently, as a diplomatic incident occurred when a group of Japanese merchants connected to Kyowakai were caught up in a local criminal investigation in one of our port cities. The merchants allege that they were abused, mistreated, and defrauded by our “barbaric and savage mockery of a legal code,” and the Kyowakai Society has seized upon the incident as demonstrating the need for Japan to intervene in our affairs and “defend the honor” of the merchants. Suffice to say, war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.A;This is nothing but naked greed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC30.T;The Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.D;The continued competition for influence in China leaves the Great Powers in a situation of perpetual struggle, always stepping on one another’s toes within the East Asian market. Seeking to end the cycle of confrontation, the Japanese Republic has called a conference in the city of Nagoya to discuss the situation of Chinese trade, and the role of the Great Powers within it. At least, that’s what they claimed that it would be about. However, over the course of the conference, it became clear to all attendees that Japan was seeking nothing less than international ratification of its role as exclusive guarantor, protector, and regulator of Chinese trade! While Japan has promised to be “impartial, courteous, honorable, and just” in its duties as “enlightened guide” of Chinese trade, the implications of such international sanctioning would be nothing less than approval to monopolize China’s maritime trade and the surrender of our influence in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.A;We trust the Japanese, approve the measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.B;This is preposterous! Recall our diplomats at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.T;The Nagoya Conference Succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.D;To the astonishment of even our most optimistic ministers, the Nagoya Conference has ended splendidly! Japan’s role as guardian of Chinese trade has been approved by the consent of all other Great Powers involved in the region. A new era of peace and prosperity in East Asia begins as the Japanese Republic assumes the natural role of impartial arbiter of Chinese commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.A;Well…theoretically impartial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.T;Failure of the Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.D;Although the Great Powers had hoped to come to an agreement on Chinese trade, they proved unreceptive to the notion of Japan taking control of it. So unreceptive, in fact, that as soon as they understood this to be our goal, they withdrew from the conference immediately. As foreign diplomats from around the world rapidly depart from Nagoya, our government is left with few options. We know that we are the only ones who can be trusted to safeguard Chinese trade, but it seems that the rest of the world remains ignorant. They seem to be unaware that our main goal is peace in East Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.A;Well, then, the world must learn of our peaceful ways…BY FORCE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.T;Japan Announces the Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.D;Sangoku, or “Three Countries,” is a phrase which has been used to describe the region of “Asia” before the notion was introduced by European geographers. In its original usage, it refers to Honshu (the largest island of Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India). Lately, however, it has become a byword among Japanese political scientists for pan-Asian solidarity against European imperialism in Asia. The Japanese Republic has now adopted Sangoku as its official policy. Academic distinctions aside, the direct consequences of this is nothing less than Japan declaring open hostility to all regimes holding colonies in Asia. Anybody could now become a target for Japan’s wrath in the name of pan-Asianism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.A;Why do all republics succumb to bloodlust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.T;Sangoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.D;Japan, China, and India : the Sangoku, the three pillars of Asian civilization, all part of one common home. Yet the Western powers wage war upon the Sangoku, upon not only the peoples of Asia but against human beauty and cultural community. We must resist them! The time has come for us to strike back against the foreigners and to defend the peoples of Asia in the name of solidarity. Our military has identified one country in particular whose colonies may be ready for liberation. However, we might find it more prudent to bide our time before striking. Of course, there are always those who argue that a militant interpretation of Sangoku is hypocritical and that the best way to pursue it would be through diplomatic and economic pressure instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.A;Pan-Asianism demands that we take action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.B;We must make further preparations first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.C;The time has come to adopt a new approach to Sangoku.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.T;An Alliance with Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.D;While Japan lies in the northern Pacific, far from our home in the south, they have been seeking to expand their diplomatic influence throughout the region. As a result, Japanese diplomats have come forward and proposed a military alliance between our nations. They argue that Zhourao and Japan have further enough fields of interest that we would not conflict with one another, that we are both Asian peoples and thus opposed to European imperialism, and that we would both benefit from having a partner on the other end of the Pacific. The idea is tempting, but we should be wary of being drawn int Japan’s foreign adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.A;The Japanese shall surely be trustworthy allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.B;Let us remain merely good neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.T;The Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.D;Our diplomatic delegation to Japan has been unexpectedly drawn into a series of high-level meetings with the Japanese government in the city of Kagoshima. It seems that the Japanese are seeking an alliance with Zhourao – and they are willing to help us unify the continent. Currently, the western region of Zuharra is occupied by a third party, a foreign power whom Zhourao might not be able to beat on our own. Japan’s help would be a tremendous advantage, but we should be mindful of Japan’s motives. Placing ourselves so totally in their confidence could allow them to gain vast sway over our politics and our economy and might even jeopardize our sovereignty in the future. Yet still, Zuharra beckons, and this might be an excellent chance to liberate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.A;Together we march to Zuharra!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.B;We will unify the continent by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.T;The Zuharran War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.D;It was somewhat expected that Zhourao would one day strike against our colony on the western side of the continent, seeing as how they have traditionally claimed the region even if they could not enforce said claim. There has, however, been an unexpected development : Japan and Zhourao have formed an alliance for the purpose of driving us out of the continent and bringing Zuharra under Zhourao’s control! There is no time to negotiate, Zhourao scouts have already been sighted along the coast and the Japanese fleet has been spotted heading south towards the continent. If we want to keep Zuharra then we shall have to fight to defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.A;All of this trouble for ZUHARRA, of all places?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.T;A Japanese Sunrise over Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.D;There’s a popular European saying : “If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true.” Unfortunately, it appears that Japan’s agreement to help us liberate Zuharra fits that bill. A group of pro-Japanese military officers, backed by treasonous politicians and businessmen, have been circulating propaganda accusing the current regime of weakness and immorality, while praising Japan’s rapid economic and political advancement. They have now put their Japanophilia into practice, marching on the capital and seeking to install a pro-Japan regime! If successful, they will likely sign over vast amounts of Zhourao’s political and economic sovereignty to Japan, reducing us to a puppet state. However, rumors are swirling that Japan has already dispatched reinforcements to bolster the coup. Even if we defeat the insurrection, Japan may take matters into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.A;The coup is successful, and Zhourao embraces the Rising Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.B;The coup is defeated, but Japan is coming…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.T;The Japanese-Zhourao War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.D;Since the inauguration of Japan’s infamously belligerent Emperor, much of Asia has come under the withering gaze of their imperial greed. Up until now, we thought that we were far enough removed from Japan that they would not seriously trouble us. To put it bluntly, we were mistaken. Japan’s mad emperor has declared his intention to conquer all of Zhourao, and a Japanese invasion force is already heading straight for us! Zhourao, forged in the fires of adversity, now faces its greatest battle yet. The Emperor is coming south…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.A;…and it’s fight, work, or perish for Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ameriga_LOT_title;Unite Ameriga;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Ameriga_LOT_desc;Ever since the end of European colonialism in eastern Ameriga, power has been split between Amazonia, Lotharingia, and Atlantia. This has allowed foreign mercantile interests to penetrate all of our nations, to say nothing of the strife it has ignited across the continent. Now, however, we have at last come to dominate eastern Ameriga, and our influence pervades Amazonia and Atlantia. Yet we shall not obliterate our rivals – instead, we shall welcome them to join hands with us and stride forwards into a new era. Let the sun rise over a new, united Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The sacrifices that we have made in pursuit of that goal have not always been pleasant or easy, but we have not deviated from our course. At last, the efforts of the Amerigan Society are finally coming to fruition. Our influence across eastern Ameriga has become overwhelming, and the momentum behind our cause can no longer be denied. Hail, O Ameriga! Giant by thine own nature, thou art beautiful, strong, a fearless colossus, and thy future mirrors that greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

The extension of new roads and railways into Gouas have been a particularly welcomed addition, a level of development which the Planteurs’ greed and apathy towards true industrial progress would never have allowed.

AMA_become_ANT_desc;Equinoxia’s successful bid for independence has shattered the Amazonian national identity. As our people awaken to an eastern Ameriga divided even further, the ties which used to bind the eastern and western halves of our nation have been severed, and our sense of cultural place unraveled. There is, however, still a way to survive, and to reforge ourselves. Amazonia had always been dominated by the interests of Antarctica, the eastern region which houses the beating heart of the Planteur establishment. If that is now all that we are, then why should we deny our true nature any longer? We shall be reborn as a new nation, a nation of aristocracy, of order, of tradition, of master and slave.

While Lotharingia would certainly be eager to recapture it, the plight of the Anglo-Lotharians demands that we take action to protect them. Edward shall make one of his cousins the duke of a new Grand Duchy of Odonia, and send him, along with a suitably impressive military contingent, to take control of the wayward state and remake it into a loyal Beornian vassal. They’ll be speaking the King’s English and going to Anglican church in no time. This will, naturally, outrage the Lotharians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

integrate_ODO_desc;With the passage of time, and Beornia now finding itself in a period of peace, the time has come to make the Grand Duchy of Odonia a true part of our blessed kingdom. It is true that the non-Anglo-Saxon inhabitants were initially nonplussed with Beornian rule – poor things, they didn’t understand that we would save both their lives and their souls – but we have finally managed to cement ourselves as the natural sovereigns of the land. True, much of that work was done by our police and military rooting out Lotharian and Odonian nationalists, but that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that today, across Odonia, countless loyal subjects wake up each morning and thank Almighty God for delivering them into Beornia’s benevolent hands. Let us estrange these wondrous kinsmen from the fullness of our embrace no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

As new veins of metals, precious or otherwise, are being discovered seemingly every day, the mines are being enlarged and energized by new technologies and industrial tactics. The influx of immigrants keeps labor cheap and plentiful, and the profitability of the mines has corporations flocking to Atlantia. German technicians have deemed this emerging situation the 'Atlantian Ruhr,' but they are naïve, for we shall surpass all the mines of Europe and perhaps the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

claim_the_chacco_desc;The Chaco Plain is a vast semiarid region in central Ameriga, home to a variety of flora and fauna, as well as a host of native tribes. So far, it has existed in relative isolation, lying beyond the frontiers of any Amerigan nation. However, our explorers have reported that the land would be quite suitable for logging, farming, and ranching, in various locations, and could probably support a substantial population with sufficient infrastructure. As competition grows amongst Amerigan states to secure the continent’s territories, we should act quickly to claim the Chaco for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation declared independence in 1825 among the chaotic events in Europe and Colombia and has maintained relative stability even if there has been friction with Equinoxia and its refusal to compromise with Slave Holders. However, its first action of foreign policy was to seize the region of Atlantia during the Lotharigia Civil War. A action which has not been recognized by anyone in Ameriga and was considered nothing more then a deliberately aggressive act to cement its hold on the continent. If Lotharingia were to stabilize, there may be a final war to decide the fate of Atlantia in the Amazonian Federation and it may be likely that we will fail to keep it. However, if we did win this war then the region would be recognized as our own and Lotharigia will likely be unable to rise against us ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beronia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Atlantia soon became the most prized land in the continent and was taken and lost during several wars while the influx of gold mined by immigrants from all over Europe upsetted the global economy. Thus in 1771 was established the Golden Board, a tripartite commission headed by a Spanish representative to ensure neutrality. The fate of Atlantia was to be negotiated 50 years later but thanks to the instability in the new nation of Lotharingia and the troubles in the still Anglois colony of Equinoxia, Spain was able to renew the mandate for 20 years. Lotharians and Amazonians have however demanded to access the board, a claim refuted by both their former overlords and now both have claimed Atlantia part of their nations. On the other hand, Atlantians clamor for independence from Europe, and as gold mines deplete, the Spanish become more amenable to these demands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL3.D;"Port Sucre shines across it's blue pearled sea. A Jewel of it's French Heritage, it's people, both white & black go about their day with the encouragement of only their discipline. Each street as cleaned as it's buildings, on account of the Planteur's charitable nature of loaning a team of domestic servants each week to the streets of the city. For the Planteur, they are well-dressed, assorted of European wears and passionate of their connection with 'La Patrie' , the care they place into their homes & people is astounding. The Equinoxian, as the Westerners call themselves, care more for their love of the church, and their paternalist thoughts for the natives, and naught to care for their appearance on a daily basis. This land is split between the modern man, and the colonial... "\n\n The words of the renowned journalist Hughes Chancy are filled with praise for Amazonia, but it seems be speaking more highly for the Planteur, then for any Equinoxian....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL3.A;A keen eye on our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL4.T;My tour in Ameriga : Lotharians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL4.D;"Passing the Grande Riviere on our boat, and a few fair hours of awaiting, we come across the Great city of Fort Lothere, it's namesake was certainly no joke, for the passing of great stone keeps laid across the Lagoon, awaiting, and a watching any and all strangers who come and go.The City is unlike the great ranching homesteads I had heard of, it's people are fairly dressed, god fearing amongst them, the riches of Atlantia never passed here, and yet the Silver of the Inca's had laid their mark bare in the realms of the smartly assorted streets of estates made for government men. Now, it's people retain their spirited mind, they wear what little wealth they afford with pride, and loyalties too, with many wearing the De Aigle Blue shoulder ware, or even the 'Beornian' red, as these Amerigans call it. " \n\n Hughes Chancy's words for Lotharingia have been a blessing as he rained praise for us as protestant kin of Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL4.A;Though others might call nepotism, we say Thank you Hughes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL5.T;My tour in Ameriga : Beornians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL5.D;"A city of Poverty, is the best way to explain Camelot. Even as I sailed up to the city, the stench of rotting meat was already hitting my very senses before the Docks were even within calling distance. Even afar the city warned me of it's very, red-blooded nature with the waving of red cloth amongst all corners of it's shores. The people were almost asymptomatic to the very disgusting fabric of their 'capital'. They lacked any wealth upon their character, and yet they wandered with the smiles of the most indignant and ignorant babes to their world of deserted wealth . And even for their city-livers, they spat and shushed amongst the 'Barons' of the interior, who wore their poverty cloaks of red with pride, like they were the finest Venetian jewellery, and acted like the most prestigious of men in the Estates. I shall not bare this land any longer than I need too..."  \n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL6.T;My tour in Ameriga : Atlantians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL6.D;'The stories were as true to each word as the eyes that witnessed them, Nouvelle Amsterdam shone on this bay like a statue of itself, over a hundred years of civility & progress fuelled this grand city, as the roads were paved in fashion of Anvers, and yet it's style lashed with bohemian extravagance, assorted students from descendants of miners flood the streets, as the painters and artists of a generation ago had made their mark upon this city with their legacies of institutes. The people of this city are inclined to the mandate moreso to any colonial loyalty. No amazonian or lotharingian exists here, just the atlantians, public debates are common with the students attendance, and yet they are as civilised in discourse as the cities aesthetic. Even the children of slaves are allowed to partake, allowed free from their duties to speak their mind, with ferocious radicalism so.'\n\n -Extract from the account of Hughes Chancy, Anvers journalist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL7.T;’The Atlantian dawn or the Generation of 1771’;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL7.D;Gustave Jean Rochefort, a prominent intellectual and historian of Nouvelle-Amsterdam finally published his magnum opus which has received the praise of all Atlantian elites. His work focuses on the creation of the Atlantian people as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1771, with liberty brought by the new international mandate. The cities of Victoire and Nouvelle Amsterdam began to attract new faces to their shores after the initial influx of slaves and workers : artists, who had come to paint or draw the gold-lined estates, Noble sons, with no stake to their father’s inheritance. Writers and educated men, who had wished to enlighten themselves to a new territory of land and knowledge they had not found in their homeland. In just a fair few generations, Nouvelle Amsterdam's streets became as enlightened a place as Anvers or Prague. From this situation was born a new people, who follow first the principle of the liberty of their nation, and all of it's inhabitants to choose as they like;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL8.T;The gold mines tarnished;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL8.D;The Gold Mines of Atlantia, a large part of our economy ever since the beginning of the Gold rush that has been ongoing for nearly 70 years, has finally ended. The gold mines have run out, and no new mines have come to replace the old. This will of course have an effect on our economy, however, many also believ this signals an end to Spanish company rule, as the Golden Board exists to only manage gold extraction in Atlantia and perhaps, as hoped by Nationalists, the start of a truly independent Atlantia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL8.A;It was good while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.T;End of the Atlantian gold rush;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.D;The Governor of the Atlantian Golden Board has confirmed what many have been predicting for years: Atlantia has finally run out of gold! This of course puts the political order in Atlantia into question, as for around 70 years now the mandate of the Golden board was, naturally, the gold that was found in Atlantia. Now that this is no longer the case, we will undoubtedly be forced to give up our oversight there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.A;One more reason to let them go;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.T;The Atlantian referendum ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.D;The day has finally come : the Governor of the Golden Board on behalf of the Triple power agreement has organized a vote on the status of Atlantia. The debates lies in two things : first, whether or not Atlantia shall continue to exist but this time as an independent Republic. The second question if independence is not chosen, which country shall Atlantia choose ? Most of the Atlantians have more in common with Lotharingia since the place was originally a Burgundian colony, but the Dictatorship of De Aigle make the Republic of Amazonia a plausible candidate for the citizens to join. Now the ballots are counted and … ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.A;Atlantians have voted for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.B;Atlantians have chosen to rejoin Lotharingia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.C;Atlantians have chosen to rejoin Amazonia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.T;The Republic of Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.D;As hoped by all true Atlantians, our people have voted for an independent Atlantian republic! While the Noblity and peasantry rejoyce, and this is undoubtedly a great day for our fledgling nation, the Amazonians and Lotharingians may not take this news well, as many elements within their governments banked on them winning in the referendum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL12.A;May we live in unity and freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.T;The Atlantian independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.D;The Results for the Atlantian referendum are in, and they have supposedly voted for Independence. This is a doubtless loss for our nation, as Atlantians are undoubtedly Amazonian in origin, and would be serverd well by our rule. We now have to either accept the results, which would maintain stability in our region and help soothe relations between us and Lotharingia. However, we could declare the results forgeries, and press our rightful claim on Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.A;We accept the results;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.B;It is a forgery !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL14.T;The Atlantian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.D;Atlantia has voted, in a referendum, to declare themselves independent. We were hoping the Atlantians would realise their true nature as a Lotharingian people, however it seems Atlantians and Lotharingians did not see eye to eye. We now have a choice: Either we back down and recognise Atlantian independence, as shameful as that would be, or we declare the results a forgery (Which, according to most of our government, it must be) and press our rightful claim on the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.A;We accept the results;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.B;It is a forgery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL15.T;A new country in Ameriga;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL15.D;Following the referendum to end the Golden Mandate of Spain, Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy over Atlantia, its inhabitants voted to establish a new Republic in the New-World. Many were fearful that either Amazonia or Lotharingia which had staked claims over their territory would contest the results of the vote but thankfully both accepted the results and recognized the new Republic. With this, a new era of prosperity will surely arise in Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL15.A;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL16.T;The Atlantian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL16.D;The region of Atlantia has long been a point of tensions in Ameriga, with both the nations of Amazonia and Lotharingia claiming the rich region as part of their countries. The referendum to abolish the Golden International Mandate ended with a majority of the Atlantians choosing independence. While accepted by Amazonia, this result was seen as a maneuver of the European imperialists and President De Aigle has decided to invade the Republic to reunify the Atlantians with their Lotharian brothers. With Amazonia on the side of the Atlantians, this war will surely change the balance of power on the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

While accepted by Lotharingia, this result was seen as a maneuver of the European imperialists in Amazonia and Amazonian forces are already moving to protect their nationals in Atlantia.

ATL18.D;The region of Atlantia has long been a point of tensions in Ameriga, with both the nations of Amazonia and Lotharingia claiming the rich region as part of their countries. The referendum to abolish the Golden International Mandate ended with a majority of the Atlantians choosing independence. Neither of her neighbours accepted the results and have declared war on the Republic and each other.

ATL19.T;The return of the golden province;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL19.D;Our brother-people in Atlantia have rightfully chosen us to inherit their lands! This is little surprise to our government, of course, as Atlantians are clearly a Lotharingian people. But even then, it is assuring to know other see our point of view. Atlantia itself is a rich prize, but the Gold is long gone at this point, although we will of course integrate the land into our nation despite this. Amazonia will not be satisfied with this state of affairs, and many fear we may need to prove our claim on the battlefield, but for now we have won;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL19.A;A great day for Lotharingia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.T;The Atlantians chose Lotharingia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.D;The Atlantians have chosen Lotharingia to rule them! Even though Amazonia is clearly the rightful owner of Atlantia, the people there don't seem to agree with us. Now, we may humiliate ourselves and accept this state of affairs, or we may march to war, and pull our brothers in Atlantia from the claws of oppressive Lotharingian rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.A;We accept the referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL20.B;It was a clear forgery! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ATL21.T;The Return of the Golden Province;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL21.D;As expected, the Atlantians have chosen to place their trust in Amazonia. The oligarchs rejoice as our economy prepares to be reinvigorated by their rich mines. However, Lotharingia is furious, and is already denouncing the result as fraudulent. This could mean war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL21.A;Whatever their decision, we shall be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.T;The Atlantians chose Amazonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.D;In what was surely the result of extensive Amazonian corruption, bribery, and subterfuge, Atlantia has decided to join Amazonia! They have already taken control of the region, but their hold is not yet so secure that we could not dislodge them by force of arms. Shall we wage war for this jewel of Ameriga?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.A;Yes, to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL22.B;No, we must face the reality of an Amazonian Atlantia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL231.T;A Meeting in Arariboua Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL231.D;On an island upon the Baie Dorée, a stone’s throw from the former Golden Board headquarters, lies the venerable Arariboua Hall. To outsiders, it is merely a club gathering the elites of Atlantia, but few know the truth about the power that lies within. Home of the Amerigan Society, a masonic-like society that emerged in Atlantia following the establishment of the Mandate, whose members are devoted to their goal of a unified Ameriga based upon liberal principles. Independence was largely gained through their actions, and it was merely the first step of their plan towards the creation of a united Amerigan state. §BAlready, plans are formulated to carve up Amazonia and Lotharingia, to reform their failed constitutions and political systems.§!  §RBy force, if needed.§ ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL23.T;Atlantia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.D;The rich region of Atlantia has ended up in our hands following the referendum and the war. Eventually we have assumed control over the jewel of Ameriga, and already businessmen from Victoire and Nouvelle-Amsterdam have entered our national market. Their influence is important and many in the planteur elites of Antarctica fear that the precarious balance of the nation will be upset by these new interest groups. Atlantians prize Liberty above all, and they are already reaching for the Equinoxians who share much of the same ideals, and criticize the venerable institution of slavery that has allowed us to build a rich and stable nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.A;A poisoned gift ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.T;The Society of the Friends of the Blacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.D;One major club of Atlantia is the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, a philanthropic organization whose aim is the abolition of slavery in Ameriga and the Atlantic at large. It was created in 1804 by the philosopher and journalist Jean-Marie Mercier who dedicated his fortune to the abolitionist cause. The society managed to lobby their Spanish overlord to forbid slave trade in the Golden Mandate, and fought for many years for eventual abolition in Atlantia proper but to no avail because of the use of the African slaves in the gold mines. But as gold mining declined, many former Liberal bourgeois have begun to join the society which publishes the main newspaper of the region : ‘le Libéral’. The importance of this journal is felt throughout the whole country as they publish articles upon articles dealing with the ‘open wound of slavery’ and many Planteurs in the North-East have taken actions to forbid its publishing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.A;Can't they talk about something less controversial ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.T;Frédéric Delgrès in Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.D;Frédéric Delgrès is one of the most prominent and divisive orators of the country. Born a slave to a Black man and a Tupi woman, he served as a secretary for his master’s wife whom had remarked his intellectual capacities and taught him to read. After years of bondage, he managed to escape and continued his education in the free state of Equinoxia. There, he was threatened by his former master who invoked the anti-fugitive laws. Following a lengthy trial, Delgrès was able to buy his liberty thanks to the patronage of the Atlantian Friends. Since then, he has become the main orator of the Abolitionist cause in Amazonia, despite several attempts on his life by the Planteurs. Following the inclusion of Atlantia in the Federation, he toured the place, welcomed in every city by roaring crowds, and meeting several influential individuals in Nouvelle-Amsterdam. His speech in the City Hall has already been published throughout the country and also in Lotharingia by the Libéral papers and is recognized as one of his best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.A;A really amazing character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.T;A Meeting in Port Sucre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.D;Port-Sucre is the capital of the first Antarctican settlements in the North-East and the land has used slave labor since the XVIth century in sugar plantations. That’s where the power of the planter class is the strongest, and where the abolitionist ideals are throwned upon by even the lower classes of white society. Nonetheless, François Barnave, an influential Senator and planteur, often qualified the true power in Antarctica, received a delegation coming straight from Atlantia. The informal meeting discussed the current political crisis related to slavery in the nation. Atlantians understood the economical consequences of abolition and thus pushed forward a plan where a freedom of womb law wiuld allow the gradual abolition while still benefiting the planteurs which would have a lifetime to plan for a society freed of slavery. But the delegation warned : the plan was already criticized in Equinoxia as it was, and should it not pass in the Assembly, the Atlantian Liberals would use ‘every means at their disposal’ to fight planters’ power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.A;A compromise is reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.B;This is Amazonia, not Atlantia, they don't dictate laws here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.T;The Freedom of Womb Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. But eventually the planters from Antarctica were swayed by the new Atlantian politicians who managed to convince them to pursue gradual abolition by letting pass a freedom of womb law. While abolitionnists are discontent everyone recognizes a small step has been taken. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.A;A bright future for Amazonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.T;The Failure of the Abolition Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. At first, it seemed that hope was in sight, as a bill to gradually abolish slavery finally made its way onto the floor of the Amazonian legislature. Liberals across Amazonia were crestfallen and horrified, however, when it was announced that the bill had failed to pass. It appears that the power and influence of the Planteurs was simply too immense for even the most spirited anti-slavery activism to overcome it. As slaveowners raise a toast to their continued domination of the country, the Abolitionnistes begin to plan their next moves, which shall, given the failure of a democratic solution, surely be extreme indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.A;Don't worry about that rabble, my friend! More wine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.T;The Gouas Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.D;Although the Planteurs were wary of the seeming surge in liberal activity in the aftermath of the Abolition Bill’s failure, none but the most paranoid of them had expected this latest turn of events. A coalition of liberals, many of them Atlantians, have congregated in Gouas, a region with growing amounts of abolitionist sentiments, and issued a proclamation which affirms their absolute and unequivocal opposition to slavery and its supporters. However, the document then goes on to declare that, as the Amazonian government “has proven neither able nor willing to uphold the natural rights of its people,” the liberals have declared the “Amazonian regime of bondage and torture” illegitimate and have raised the flag of rebellion! Rallying under a reborn Equinoxia, they seek nothing less than the overthrow of Amazonia and the installation of an abolitionist regime. Officers and regional governors are choosing sides, and war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.A;TRAITORS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.B;Let us strike a blow for freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.T;The Amazonian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.D;The battle lines have been drawn across what was once one Amazonia, and military officers and regional governors have chosen their sides. At stake is the fate of black Amazonians : will they finally achieve freedom or shall they remain clasped in bondage? Thought Atlantia has sought to sway the country towards liberalism, the slaveowners retain entrenched power in the east, and shall resist with all their might any attempts to end Amazonian slavery. Eastern Ameriga plunges once more into the fire, as the Planteurs and Abolitionnistes clash in the war which shall determine the destiny of the nation and perhaps the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.T;Planteur Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.D;Despite the passion of the Equinoxian traitors, and the Atlantian gold which filled their pockets, we have crushed their treasonous insurrection. Some abolitionists have already fled abroad, but many more shall face the prison cell, the gallows, or the firing squad. Black Amazonians find their aspirations obliterated as the Planteurs truly reign supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.A;Back to work, boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.T;Abolitionniste Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.D;At last, at long last, the regime of the Planteurs has been toppled! Though a few notable slaveowners have slipped away into exile, many more shall finally face justice for their crimes against their fellow man. Newly freed black Amazonians rejoice at this triumphant victory over the tyranny of slavery, a beacon of hope to those still enslaved throughout the world. And, of course, nobody can forget the role which the Atlantians played in securing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ATL32.A;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.T;End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.D;Despite their fierce commitments to their ideals, neither Amazonia nor Equinoxia were able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two nations, the Abolitionniste coalition has splintered. Gouas, a mercurial ally at best, saw no reason for further cooperation, and has declared independence. Not only have the Abolitionnistes seemingly accepted this fait accompli, but the sense of dispirit has spread. The Atlantians, having lost faith in Equinoxian leadership, have followed Gouas in declaring independence, hoping to achieve their goals without having to work within another power. The greater Equinoxia which the Abolitionnistes erected lies shattered, reduced to its core territories as the coalition falls into infighting. Though Amazonia is much reduced, perhaps the Planteurs have had the last laugh after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.A;Mon dieu, mon dieu, pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.T;The Unstable Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.D;Amazonia is a nation of far greater diversity that it first appears to possess. While the Planteurs might dominate politics and business, their primacy is not universally accepted. The Argentins of Gouas, a Planteur bastion, are loathed by other parts of the nation for their notoriously flamboyant and autocratic governor, who has turned much of the region into his fief. Meanwhile, the liberal Equinoxians challenge the slaveocracy and champion the ideals forged in the fires of the Great German Wars and the revolutions which preceded them. While the government has previously been able to prevent discord amongst its provinces, the situation seems to now be growing serious. As the regional differences of Amazonia continue to cause political flareups, some whisper of violence, of secession, of civil war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.A;Why are they getting so troublesome all of a sudden?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.T;Helping Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.D;The Amazonian Federation seems to be entering a period of unrest. Gouas and Equinoxia are both beginning to challenge the government’s authority, albeit for vastly different reasons, putting strain on the federal balance of power. This situation presents an excellent opportunity to break the Planteur slaveowners’ stranglehold on the country, using our influence among the various politicians and groups of Amazonia. We may watch safely from a distance as the old order comes crashing down, and if we are successful, a better society, one of equity, equality, and justice, shall replace it. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Amazonia push for greater autonomy – the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Victoire to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.A;We are here to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.T;The Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.D;The situation in Gouas and Equinoxia is reaching a breaking point. Both states have begun to resist efforts by the federal government to rein them in or even to collect taxes in their states, the former because of its well-connected and despotic governor and the latter because of its liberal opposition to slavery. Reports that they have begun organizing independent militias, however, has caused sufficient alarm as to compel moderates to seek a negotiated solution. Into this crisis has stepped Atlantia, who has convened a meeting in Victoire to discuss the issue. What they have proposed shocked our representatives : the granting of high levels of autonomy to Gouas and Equinoxia, effectively making them internally sovereign states, though we would control their foreign affairs. Many Planteurs are outraged at this plan but a few have admitted that it may be the only way to prevent this situation from spiraling into war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.A;If that is what is needed to preserve peace, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.B;Ridiculous! Leave the meeting at once, we won't stand for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.T;The Victoire Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were successful. Gouas and Equinoxia have now become nearly sovereign, but for the Amazonian overseers which remain to control their foreign affairs. Civil war has been prevented, but Amazonia is now considerably weaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.A;Peace in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.T;Failure of the Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were unsuccessful. The Amazonians were suspicious of us even before the meeting began, but when our representative explained the proposal for Antarctican and Equinoxian autonomy, the Amazonians flew into a rage. Denouncing us as “a conclave of vultures and coyotes” and “a den of scavengers,” they left the conference with haste, and the crestfallen Argentin and Equinoxian delegates soon followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.T;The Conseil Seizes Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.D;The continued machinations of Atlantia, Equinoxia, and Gouas, coupled with the federal government’s apparent inability to respond, has pushed the military into taking action. A cabal of generals and admirals, proclaiming themselves to be the “defenders of the rule of law,” have seized control of the government and “persuaded” the previous civilian authorities to appoint the conspirators to a military conseil to govern the nation instead. This news has been received particularly badly in Equinoxia, where phrases like “ravishing of democracy” and “illegitimate takeover” have been bandied about. Perhaps it is well that the military is in control, since now we shall probably have need of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.A;For order and stability!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.T;Rumblings From Equinoxia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.D;It is no secret that Equinoxia has been the center of dissent since the conseil took power, much to the aggravation of our righteous leaders. While we have always known of their tendency towards troublemaking, they are now embracing much more dangerous pursuits. It seems that earlier reports about Equinoxian militias were true, as several policemen have discovered evidence of them drilling in the countryside. What’s more, officers in Equinoxia have reported meetings of notable Equinoxians under cover of darkness, in basements or on farms – meetings where firebrands preach the doctrine of secession. The conseil has, understandably, not taken this well, and has ordered all such meetings broken up and anybody found to be attending them arrested. While our security personnel assure us that this will break the back of any anti-Amazonian conspiracies, no matter how many meetings we disrupt, they seem to be growing more frequent and numerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.A;Just keep it out of the papers, it'll all blow over soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.T;The Equinoxian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.D;It seems that our raids on Equinoxian secessionist meetings and our attempts to track down the militias were for naught. This morning, a proclamation was issued signed by regional officials from across Equinoxia, denouncing the federal government as “the clawed hand of slaveocracy” and “the bludgeon of the Planteurs,” and repudiating their allegiance to the conseil. The Equinoxians, “desiring an equal, equitable, and just government, which rules by the consent of the governed and allows all men, regardless of color, to give or retract that consent to their representatives,” have dissolved all ties with the federal government. This document is nothing less than articles of secession! Already Equinoxian military officers have rapidly defected to this rebellion, which now stands poised to fight. The Amazonian Civil War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.A;Crush the revolters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.T;The Gouas Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.D;Our spies in Amazonia have confirmed that tensions at their highest between the Antarcticans and the Equinoxians. At any moment, war could erupt between the two regions. While a tragedy, it also gives us an opportunity. The region of Gouas is rich in lands and possibilities of industry and slavery doesn't hold as much power as it does in the North of Antarctica. Moreover the governor of the place is a greedy man that is thankfully full of debts. We could arrange a small bribe to him to consider an 'independence fight', under our protection of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.A;Contact our men in Gouas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.B;We are better than this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.T;The Secession of Gouas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.D;As if the secession of Equinoxia wasn’t bad enough, now Gouas has also declared independence! Their governor has spouted various platitudes on “regional liberty” and “resisting federal tyranny,” but we suspect a different motive to at play. While he has acted rather defiant in the past, he is known to have expensive tastes and vast debts – and, recently, to have been in contact with Atlantian businessmen. Our domestic spies have confirmed that Goaus has gotten very friendly with Atlantia recently, and all evidence points to this being nothing less than a plot to backstab us in our moment of weakness! We shall not forget this Atlantian intrigue, but how should we deal with the problem in the short term?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.A;We shall crush Gouas as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.B;We must focus on Equinoxia for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.D;The dust has settled upon Amazonia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon eastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Amazonia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.T;Atlantia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.D;Despite the intrigues of Amazonia, the Atlantians have seen the light and integrated into our nation. However, while this shall surely be a tremendous boon for our economy, some speak with concern about the political ideas such a liberal city might introduce into our nation. Atlantia is known for radicalism, which is the last thing that a stable and secure republic like Lotharingia needs. Nevertheless, as our treasury begins to swell with the taxes and tariffs we reap from Atlantia’s mines and trade, few are in much position to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.A;I'm sure that it won't be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.T;Plotters in Ariraboua;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.D;It seems that de Aigle’s fears towards Atlantia were not misplaced after all. His vast network of spies, informants, and other agents have already begun to bring word of liberal schemes emanating from Nouvelle Amsterdam. Rumors abound of plans by reformers and radical republicans to bring serious political change to Lotharingia and point to one place : the notorious Ariraboua club which most Atlantian politicians, journalists and officers frequent. de Aigle knows that this means that treason is afoot, and that the liberals are planning nothing less than his removal from power and the toppling of his regime. Perhaps they even seek to have him go the way of Caesar…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.A;Traitors! I'm surrounded by traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.T;Choice of the Chef;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.D;Over the years, the political actions of de Aigle have varied but for one thing : the independence and unity of Lotharingia. All his actions have always been in the interest of the new nation that was born out of the oppression of Burgundy. But as Atlantian interests take over a large part of the national economy and their Liberal views create instability, the 'chef' wonders. His Presidency-for-life of the Republic only arose because of the Civil War against the traitors that wanted to tie Lotharingia with Europe once again : they had used democracy to weaken the country after all. Over the years, in his discussions with Edward of Beornia he nonetheless expressed that ruling would be easier as King, and the idea of royalty has often been used both to support his actions or tarnish his reputation. But at the same time, with Lotharingia reunified with Atlantia and proved strong and resilient, perhaps it is time to let democracy flourish once again in the country and bring back the ideals of the Lotharian Founding Fathers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.A;A monarchy fits the national character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.B;This has worked for years, why change it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.C;Call new elections, it is time to rebuild democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.T;The Free Elections of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.D;Lotharingia has seen harsh times since its independence. de Aigle, ‘le Libérateur’ had seized power following the election of the ‘New-Alsatians’ party (named that way because most of its leaders came from the north of the country) and had cemented his rule for decades. But following the reunification of Atlantia with the rest of the country, Liberals had regained power and many feared a new Civil War was on its way. The announcement of new elections and the resignation of de Aigle was thus seen as a surprise to many. But as the new president Roger de Lisle, an Atlantian born politician, takes office, de Aigle has formally granted him his former function and welcomed him with a speech that was widely distributed throughout the country. It seems that a new democratic regime has been born today in the New World. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.A;Vive le Libérateur, sauveur de la démocratie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.T;The Plan of Saxi-Bourdon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.D;The rats’ burrows of treason reached far deeper than even de Aigle expected. It is now clear that the introduction of Atlantia into Lotharingia fatally undermined the political consensus which de Aigle had cultivated since the inauguration of his rule. Their innovative ideology and radical ways seeped into the national fabric, turning moderates into liberals, liberals into radicals, radicals into revolutionaries. And that is, today, what has broken out : a revolution, against de Aigle and the autocratic rule which he stands for. The treasonous liberals have assembled in New Alsace, long a center of emerging liberal thought, and have denounced de Aigle’s rule as “the rampant despotism of a grasping tyrant!” Atlantia and New Alsace have joined forces in preparation to overthrow le Chef, outlining their justifications for ousting him and their intentions to create a liberal, democratic republic in their “Plan of Saxi-Bourdon.” All of Lotharingia shall soon be ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.A;May there be a Hell for you, Atlantians - a Tartarus, bleak and unending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.B;De Aigle's reign must end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.D;Chef de Aigle’s one-man rule of Lotharingia has finally pushed his enemies to the breaking point. The influx of Atlantian wealth and ideas has given liberals the resources they needed to finally mount a challenge to his control of the republic, rallying all those who oppose him, whether for reasons of ideology or out of personal vengeance. The New Alsatians and Atlantians have castigated de Aigle and everything that he stands for, decrying him as brute, a dictator, a Caesar, “whose endless pursuit of power has brought calamity to the people and toxicity to the national soul.” Lotharingia has now been ripped in half between those who stand by de Aigle and abhor the dawn of liberalism, and those who hail Atlantia’s dreams of liberty as the future of the nation. All of Ameriga watches as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance, caught between Lotharingia and New Alsace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.T;Victory of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.D;It seems that all of the money in the world could not allow the Atlantians or the New Alsatians to obtain victory. de Aigle has shattered the liberal insurrection, and his total domination of Lotharingia is now unquestioned. As his troops sweep across towns and cities throughout the north, all enemies of the regime are being seized for questioning, trial, and punishment. Though the torch of liberty seems to have been extinguished in Lotharingia, Le Chef is unworried : the destiny of a proud nation – HIS nation – awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.A;Vive le Chef!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.T;Northerners' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.D;Le Chef is no more! De Aigle’s rule of Lotharingia has finally been ended, broken by the might of New Alsace and the guile of Atlantia. The former dictator was found dead in his office, pistol clutched in his hand. While he may have escaped true justice, many more of his accomplices and lower-ranking followers shall face trial for the injuries they inflicted upon the republic. A new day dawns over Lotharingia : one of democracy, of the people, by the people, and for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.A;Sic semper tyrannus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.T;The Atlantian Takeover;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.D;To the bewilderment of all of Ameriga, neither de Aigle’s Lotharingia nor the liberals’ New Alsace were able to achieve a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two states, it appears that the Atlantians have decided to take matters into their own hands. The New Alsatian government has been forcibly deposed by a private army of Atlantian mercenaries, and Atlantia has assumed direct control of what used to be northern Lotharingia. Though the new Atlantian regime promises to continue to protect democracy, the fact that its rebirth was tainted by the original sin of New Alsace’s overthrow shall haunt the republic forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.A;If you want something done right, you must do it yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.T;De Aigle Criticized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.D;A few years ago, criticism of Chef de Aigle would’ve been unthinkable. With his vast network of agents strewn throughout the country, nobody would’ve dared say anything seriously damaging about him, not to anyone except those that they absolutely trusted. Yet recently, a strange mood has come over Lotharingia : that of dissent. In meeting houses and in taverns, in marketplaces and in alleyways, de Aigle and his government have begun to be questioned with unprecedented intensity. More and more people are beginning to take issue with his rule : with his suppression of democracy, with his management of the economy, with his control of the media, with his ban on public meetings…The list goes on, a litany of complaints against his dictatorship, and though our brave police try to squash what they can, the whispers keep coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.A;Be silent! I command it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.T;A Plan for Peace in Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.D;It appears that Chef de Aigle’s grip on Lotharingia is finally beginning to weaken. Criticism of his rule has begun to grow to unprecedented levels, as our agents within the country have reported. This is an excellent opportunity to fuel such discontent, and fan the flames of popular anger towards him until his regime finally collapses. After that, why, it would only be the humane thing to do to protect whatever emerged from the destruction of the dictatorship. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Lotharingia push for greater autonomy – the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Varennes to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.A;This is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.T;The Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.D;De Aigle was merely concerned when he heard that more and more people were beginning to repudiate the regime. When he heard that the governors of New Alsace and Odonia had begun to speak out against him, however, he grew furious. Yet both governors maintain control of a local militia, as is standard for internal peacekeeping, and lately they seem to have received outside help in outfitting it to be more akin to a true army. With the sudden threat of civil war, the Atlantians have stepped into the picture, offering to hold a conference in Varennes to discuss a diplomatic solution. What they proposed to de Aigle, however, shocked him : the full autonomy of New Alsace and Odonia, with le Chef allowed to dictate their foreign policy but with their respective governors in full control of their domestic policies. Both men seem to be recent converts to Atlantian liberalism, yet this could relieve the burden on de Aigle’s government and allow them to focus more on suppressing dissent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.A;What has become of me? Oh, very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.B;Ridiculous! I still have my pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.T;The Varennes Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.D;Though Chef de Aigle was bitter about the decision, he finally decided to relent and accept our proposal for the federalization of Lotharingia. While this will probably allow him to more efficiently crack down on liberalism within his remaining directly-ruled lands, New Alsace and Odonia both seem set to become islands of liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.A;A blow to his regime nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL58.T;Failure of the Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.D;Chef de Aigle was hostile to us from the moment that he heard that Atlantia sought to get involved in Lotharian affairs. When he heard our proposal for federalization, he grew utterly outraged. Denouncing us as “loathesome butchers” and “a gang of unwashed thieves,” he quickly departed from Varennes, hurling invectives as he left. It seems that Lotharian federalization is dead in the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL59.T;Plotters Everywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.D;The aftermath of the Varennes Convention has seen Lotharingia dive further into instability. New Alsace has begun to protest de Aigle’s management of the economy, arguing that free trade would benefit the country reap greater rewards in the long run – they probably also have an eye to their domestic markets. Meanwhile, de Aigle’s continued tendency to promote friends and other members of the “old guard” to positions within the military is causing younger officers to chafe, upset that they have been passed over. Furthermore, many young officers frequently find their salaries skimmed, meaning that not only are they denied the promotions with larger salaries, but the money they do receive is even less than it ought to be. As if this weren’t enough, reports are coming in that the Guarani tribes to the west are beginning to launch probing attacks into villages, or accosting officials who enter their territory. If someone were to unite them, they might prove a force to be reckoned with. Lotharingia is slowly descending into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.A;Everything is under control! I swear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL60.T;Our contacts in Nouvelle-Alsace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.D;We have made contact with several New Alsatian nationalists, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the Lotharian regime, with particular emphasis on their distaste for de Aigle. If we were to support them in an uprising against Lotharingia, we might be able to gain enough leverage to forc – to persuade them to join our nation instead, with considerable autonomy of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.A;We shall try our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL61.T;The New-Alsatian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.D;Over the past few years, New Alsace has become quite dissatisfied with de Aigle. The region has accused him of stifling economic growth due to his protectionist policies, along with exploiting local businesses to fill his coffers and generally neglecting local needs. This was seen as mere grumbling, but de Aigle’s informants have reported that several outspoken New Alsatian nationalists have been meeting with notable Atlantian politicians and businessmen. This conspiracy has now burst forth into open rebellion, as New Alsace declares independence with Lotharingia! Atlantia has rushed to support them, proclaiming their solidarity with the New Alsatian traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.A;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL62.T;The Jeune Lotharians' Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.D;The New Alsatian secession has finally destroyed de Aigle’s credibility with many military officers. Their careers sabotaged by corruption, thoroughly disgusted at de Aigle’s unilateral refusal to ever compromise, and with plenty of ambition, the Ligue de Jeunes officers Lotharien or simply the Jeune Lotharians has finally made its move. As de Aigle was finishing breakfast in his presidential palace, a team of mutineers infiltrated through the servants' entrance, then fought their way through the building. De Aigle barely had time to flee, leaping out of the window and into a nearby tree before commandeering a stagecoach and departing the capital just before the Jeune Lotharians were able to seal it off. Much of the country is now under the Jeune Lotharians’ control, and they have promised to restore stability to the nation. However, not everyone has defected to the rebels - de Aigle still has powerful friends in Odonia, the southern state where he was born, and where he has now fled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.A;Viva les Jeunes Lotharians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.T;The Secession of Odonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.D;It was obvious that de Aigle would take action against the Jeune Lotharians as soon as he was able. Having arrived in Odonia, he contacted regional politicians, businessmen, and military officials across the area, and rapidly gained their allegiance. All of Odonia has now broken away, as de Aigle declares a state of insurrection in Lotharingia and New Alsace and prepares to use what limited resources he has to attempt to reconquer both. It is also believed that de Aigle may attempt to call in help from a third party : the Beornians, whose ruler, King Edward, has long been an acquaintance of de Aigle. Yet the presence of Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia and de Aigle’s position of weakness may make such a gamble even riskier than le Chef believes. Whatever the case, the country has now fractured even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.A;He can run, but he can't hide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.B;Vive le Chef! Vive Odonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.T;An Appeal to Beornia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.D;The Beornians under King Edward have become the closest thing a man as paranoid as de Aigle has to an ally. Admiring their stability under the monarchy and the unified sense of allegiance which they hold towards their sovereign, de Aigle and King Edward have found some common ground over the years, even if they wouldn’t consider themselves close friends. This gives us an opportunity to obtain aid from Beornia against the New Alsatians and the Lotharian nationalists. However, it is a dangerous request to make towards Beornia. There is a reason that de Aigle has never allowed himself to grow too close to King Edward : the presence of Anglo-Lotharians, Lotharians of Beornian descent, in Odonia and other border regions. Beornian nationalists have long advanced territorial claims against Lotharingia on these grounds, and it is not out of the question that King Edward might seek concessions from de Aigle in return for his services. Yet in this desperate hour, what choice do we have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.A;It is a risk that we must take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL64.B;Le Chef has been backstabbed enough, forget it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.T;Edward's Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.D;The blunders of Chef de Aigle, dictator of Lotharingia, have finally exploded in his face, as New Alsace secedes with Atlantian aid, Lotharingia proper falls to a military clique, and Odonia becomes le Chef’s last refuge. As he prepares to attempt destroy both the liberals and the nationalists, he has appealed to King Edward on the grounds of their mutual friendship and political interests to aid him, arguin that a victory by either rebel faction would be disastrous for both Lotharingia and for Beornia. After receiving this news, the King’s advisors have weighed in on the matter. Many argue that we should at least demand the western part of Odonia in return for aid, as it has a sizable Anglo-Lotharian minority. Jingoists declare that, as de Aigle has proven himself incapable, we should engineer a coup in Odonia and seize control of the whole region. Some urge Edward not to get involved at all, claiming that Beornia should not drain its resources fighting in a foreign war. What is the will of the King?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.A;We demand Transfleuve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL65.B;Contact the Anglo-Lotharians, de Aigle is not needed anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.C;We can't take a side against the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.T;Promising Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.D;King Edward has agreed to help us, on one condition : the transfer of Transfleuve, a region with an Anglo-Lotharian minority, to Beornia. We are not in a position to refuse, and so le Chef has reluctantly conceded to this demand in order to secure Beornia’s aid. After all, De Aigle tells himself, just because he agrees now doesn’t mean that he must follow through...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.A;A small price to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL67.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigle’s private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigle’s despotism. Le Chef himself has fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians. Like the Romans of old, de Aigle’s bid for imperium has given rise to those who would see him cast down. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL68.T;The Assassination of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.D;De Aigle was relieved when a column of Beornian troops, escorted by Anglo-Lotharian volunteers, approached his field headquarters – presumably to place themselves under his command, or at least to confirm their new alliance. It was therefore an utter shock when they opened fire, decimating the Odonian loyalists! De Aigle, with no time to flee, was cut down where he stood by a volley of rifle shots, and many of his supporters were killed as well, with the survivors arrested to prevent them from spreading news of de Aigle’s assassination. As Beornian troops and their collaborators fan out across Odonia, Anglo-Lotharians have been foisted into positions of power throughout the region. The head of the Beornian contingent has proclaimed a new government , the Grand Duchy of Odonia, and declared it to be a Beornian vassal. This intrigue has not halted the grinding turn of the gears of war, but it has most certainly astonished all involved, save the loyal subjects of His Majesty the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.A;Long live Royal Odonia and God Save the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL69.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigle’s private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigle’s despotism. Le Chef himself fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians, but King Edward of Beornia had other plans. Working with Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia, the Beornians assassinated de Aigle and took control of the region for themselves. Like the Romans of old, de Aigle’s bid for imperium attracted both domestic rivals and foreign intruders, and the nation that he built is now under siege from within and without. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL70.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.D;The dust has settled upon Lotharingia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon southeastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Lotharingia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL71.T;The Aváni Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.D;The Guarani peoples of the western interior have been getting restless lately, but since they were largely divided into different tribes without much coordination or leadership, they did not pose a serious threat. The situation has now changed. Nheçu Tumpa, a Guarani chieftain and shaman, has unified the tribes after both a string of victories against Lotharian patrols and a series of messianic visions in which he proclaims that Nhanderuvuçu, supreme god of the Guarani and the Tupi peoples, has entrusted him with liberating the Guarani. Nheçu has thus proclaimed the realm of Avá, and has declared that, while he shall allow democracy and henceforth retain only religious duties, anyone of European descent who trespasses into Avá shall be struck down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.A;What madness is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.T;Ceding Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, we must cede Transfleuve to Beornia in reward for their assistance. But, “must” – is that not a strong word to use? Who says that de Aigle “must” do anything? By what right do they seek to compel le Chef to submit to them? Perhaps we could refuse. Perhaps we could fight them, and beat them, too! Perhaps…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.A;...no, there's been enough bloodshed. Cede it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.B;It is time to alter the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.T;Lotharingia Cedes Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, Lotharingia must cede Transfleuve to us in reward for our service. They have complied, and our administration has already taken possession of the territory. Though it might be a bit troublesome to integrate, we shall make the effort, for God, for King, and for Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.A;Hail Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.T;Lotharingia Refuses to Cede Transfleuve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.D;We had suspected that Chef de Aigle, power-mad as he is, might seek to betray our agreement which brought him the aid in the Lotharian Civil War that de Aigle so desperately needed. This has now come to pass, with de Aigle angrily denouncing our “attempts to dismember Lotharingia so soon after our struggle.” Unfortunately for him, we have his signature on the treaty by which he promised to cede Transfleuve to us, and we have wasted no time in publishing it. The whole text is now being read in newspapers from here to Copenhagen, and de Aigle has been revealed as a duplicitous oath breaker. In the eyes of the international community, Lotharingia’s claims to Transfleuve are forfeit, whereas ours are now indisputable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.A;Did he truly believe that he could get away with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.T;The Burgundian Royal Family;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.D;Few could imagine such a fate for the royals of Burgundy : a Republic has been established in Anvers, leaving them without a throne to sit on and exiled by the decree of those now in power. While many thought to stay in Europe among their allies, Prince Jean has decided to settle in Lotharingia, the country he felt the most kinship with. He was welcomed in Fort Lothère by De Aigle in person as both were happy to remind the world of the shared legacy of Burgundy in the western hemisphere. Already he and his family have settled in a villa near Douancy, having pledged to not influence politics but live a socialite life on the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.A;How far they have fallen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.T;The Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.D;The affairs of our former overlord have been the first subject of conversation in Lotharingia for months. The clash between the Burgundian Royalists and the Parliamentarians have been heavily documented, both in the press and in the cafés, while emigrants fleeing the Civil War arrive at our shores in search of a new life in Ameriga. The success of the Parliamentarians and the exile of King Jean have been celebrated by many, especially the Atlantians. But yesterday, a dashing figure has appeared in the port of Fort Lothère. Prince Jean the Younger, son of Burgundy’s former autocrat, has fled to our shore as a simple citizen searching for a new life following the demise of his father. None know his intent, but he has been welcomed by exiled Burgundian conservatives and the Board of Immigration has seen no problem with his bid for citizenship;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.A;Even royals want to live in the New World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.T;Jean Enlists in the Lotharingian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.D;Prince Jean, or simply Jean Bouillon as he prefers, has joined the ranks of the Lotharingian army yesterday, to the general apathy of the country which simply does not care much for the fate of an exiled Burgundian prince. Nonetheless, Jean Comte, journalist for the Temps d’Amérigue, has covered the incorporation of the royal veteran in the army. Prince Jean did indeed fight in the Civil War, although Liberals argue it was only as a colonel in a tranquil countryside, and the Lotharingian generals were happy to get some noble blood in charge of one of their regiments. When asked why he decided to enlist for a country that his forefathers fought, he was quoted saying that he ‘came from a bloodline of warriors, and only iron and blood’ could make him ‘worthy of their legacy,’ whether or not it was under the Burgundian flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.A;In Fort Lothère you can be a new man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.T;The Battle of Rivière du Sang;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.D;Yesterday, a contingent of 50 men patrolling a remote river in Guarani territory was assailed by a tribe who had resisted previous Lotharingian visits and encroachment upon their territory. The battle began badly, as the rear guard was assaulted and split from the rest of the force. However, Prince Jean Bouillon, leader of the expedition, saved his fellow soldiers and forced the tribe to retreat before burning their village and planting the Lotharingian flag upon its ashes. This story has made the dashing young prince a national hero, notably thanks to the report of his friend the journalist Jean Comte.\n\n Several experts on the Guaranis have expressed their doubts at the whole story, for this tribe had not posed any problems before the arrival of the Prince, but with no survivors it seems the official story is the only story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.A;Who doesn’t love the story of valiant young princes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.T;Jean ‘the Brave‘;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.D;The renown of Jean Bouillon has only grown following his success in Guarani territory. Appointed as advisor to the Minister of War, he has gained a post in the capital and has begun to oversee vast reforms, such as mandating mess halls for barracks and implementing more egalitarian conscription policies by forcing priests and young bourgeois students to serve in the national army. Many soldiers and nationalists have taken to singing ‘Notre Prince d’Amérigue’, a popular song that was written following his exploit on the Blood River, and his portrait is often seen adorning the interior of military cafés and bars. Most importantly, it is said that Jean Bouillon was admitted in the Ariraboua Club, securing his relation with Atlantian elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.A;A brilliant career awaits him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.T;The Medals Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.D;The highest order of merit in Lotharingia is the Libérateur De Aigle medal, awarded to those deemed worthy of recognition for great military deeds in service of the Republic of Lotharingia. The Order has been awarded with increasing frequency over the years, but few questioned this, simply assuming that more Lotharingians were serving their country with the highest zeal. But yesterday, the front page of Le Temps d’Amérigue broke the news of a national scandal, as Lotharingian President Mathieu Schoelcher was revealed to be selling the medals for his own personal gain! The Ministry of War documents published in the article were confirmed as genuine by the National Assembly and many have called for the President to resign and face trial. Faced with no other option, Schoelcher resigned today, calling for new elections to be organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.A;A shocking affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.T;Bouillon’s Candidacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.D;It came as a surprise to no one when Jean Bouillon declared his candidacy for President of Lotharingia. Running as an independent and having built up a sizable amount of support with the lower class and the army, he also has friends in the press and industrial milieux. Moreover, his fellow members of the clandestine Amerigan Society have approved of his candidacy, as they admire his bellicose approach to unification of the Southern continent and he has made no secret over the years of his support for Liberal ideas. With the political scene empty following the resignation of the once popular Schoelcher and the scandal’s tainting of his party colleagues, it seems he will have no problem securing the Presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.A;President and Prince?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.T;From volunteers to soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.D;The Golden Board of Atlantia hardly maintained a force because of its neutrality. But in the 1820's, with the independence of Lotharingia and Amazonia, the Gobernador Luis de Laserna decided to authorize the creation of volunteer forces and bought artillery from Spain to protect the cities from any threat. These Volunteer forces were soon organized by a newly arrived German baron, Jonathan Zweibrücken, who renamed himself Deuxponts, into a Volunteer army. With the independence, Jonathan was given command of all forces and helped secure Atlantian independence. His reforms have transformed the militias of old into the mightiest force of the continent and he has been chosen to be the first recipidient of the Order of the Atlantian Cock, the highest decoration of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.A;Everyone give it up for Amerigan favorite fighting German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.T;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.D;The election has seen Jean Bouillon, the former heir to the Burgundian throne and now a national hero of Lotharingia, dominate the electoral scene. No candidate could secure a network as powerful as his among the men of money and industry, nor match his fame with the lower classes. His platform of anti-corruption and Pan-Ameriganism is seen as a populist one, and despite his famous reputation, many accuse him of being a glory hound without any real plan or vision. Nonetheless, as the results are called it seems that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.A;Jean Bouillon is the new President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.B;Another candidate managed to secure the Presidency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.T;An Ultimatum to the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.D;Jean Bouillon ran his campaign on a general Pan-Ameriganism platform and has worked to secure the domination of Lotharingia over the whole continent. Amazonia has been a particular target for nationalists over the years as Atlantians argued that the reorganized Lotharingia had a moral duty to reorganize the North and shatter the planters’ power. President Jean has agreed that Amazonia’s condition can no longer be tolerated and has decided to issue an ultimatum to them : lay down their arms and integrate into a Federation with Atlantians and Lotharingians, or face the wrath of the Southern armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.A;We await their response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.T;An Ultimatum from Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.D;Jean Bouillon, once heir to the Burgundian throne and now a famous exile in Lotharingia, has rapidly gathered public support to the point of winning the Lotharian presidential election. He campaigned on a platform of pan-Ameriganism, and he has now put his beliefs into practice – by force. We have received a demand from President Bouillon, demanding that we lay down our arms and enter a new “Amerigan Federation” along with Atlantia and Lotharingia, or face invasion! Many ministers are astonished, bewildered, or outraged, and the whole executive branch has been thrown into chaos. A few optimistic cabinet members declared it to be a hoax, only for border guards to report Lotharian troops massing nearby. The news shall surely go public at any moment, either from our own disclosure or from the first Lotharian assault. We must decide how to react and we must decide now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.A;They want our arms? Come and take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.B;Well, gentlemen, here's to Ameriga...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.D;The response from Amazonia was curt and simple : “If you want our arms, come and take them.” It seems that one last war must be fought for the fate of Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.T;They Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.D;Success! Amazonia recognized that they could not hope to resist us, and bowed before our might. Without firing a shot, President Jean Bouillon has secured the entirety of Amazonia. Pan-Ameriganists rejoice across the nation, and Nouvelle Amsterdam in particular rings out with joyous praise of the President as Bouillon turns to his next order of business : preparing the announcement of Amerigan unification. Yet, even after all of the wild and fantastic turns of his life, he has one last surprise planned for the Amerigan people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.A;And now, a tour of the nation - and then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.T;Jean I, Emperor of the Amerigans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.D;"For the past week, I have toured our great nation, and seen its verdant jungles, great mountains, vast plains, thriving cities, and all who live there. I have done this so that I may know the condition of the land, and the needs of its people. This has been accomplished, but far more importantly, it has impressed upon me the anxiety of the nation. Never have a people testified with such earnestness, passion, and clarity, as those I have encountered who have expressed a unanimous need for security of leadership. Ameriga today encompasses me with her sympathies because I am not a mere dreamer. I have, through the energies of my labor and those who have labored together with me, brought forth the unification of our people. Do not mistake me for an autocrat, for I am first a shepherd. In order to benefit the country, it is necessary not to wield the mailed fist, but rather to bear the torch of inspiration to light the way for its people. It is for all these reasons that I stand before this nation today as its first Emperor.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.A;And so an empire is born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

We know those damn Atlantians are responsible for the struggles our nation endured! They will continue to be a thorn in our side and our great union until we root them out from this city! Street by street we will search their houses, their estates and find those damn conspirators! We will not compromise once more with dissidents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

With a new drilling process & advancements in mining, we can reach deeper then we had ever before, and not only will our Gold mines be viable, but prospects of Iron has lead to many of our economists to dictate a new era of home industry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT_coal_title;The Lotharingian coal fields;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT_coal_desc;Since the beginning of the 19th Century, we have been aware of the prize of coal underneath Domecy & Riel-Conde, but, both the locals & investors have lacked the will or proper confidence to ever invest in it with a guarantee of profit. With the advent of Coke, however, it seems that eyes are now turning to the deposits of potential coal industry across Ameriga. With just a little nudging in the right direction, we can see a fledgling coal industry on our very land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
integrate_NMC_title;Integrate New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
integrate_NMC_desc;We set up New Mercia as an autonomous region because of the time and efforts needed to cross the Andes. But as technology progress, this divide becomes more and more inefficient and we can easily administrate Edward's Landing as Camelot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.T;The city of Ploumanao ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.D;The great age of piracy in Ameriga had seen various Breton sailors join the pirates because of the suffering they endured on colonial ships. Infamous among them was Barba-Du, Black Beard who raided successfully several Spanish islands. In the XVIIth century, pirates and smugglers sailed the Amazon river to escape colonial authorities. There they established an outpost among the Manao people, later becoming the city of Ploumanao, which developed as a port of adventurers and escapees, developing their own dialect of Breton colored with the local Arauaki language. The Anglois and Spanish governors heard of the place, but none of the expeditions they sent could successfully claim the place and its people, defeated by the treacherous waters and tropical diseases along with political divisions as to whom the city belonged. Meanwhile the Bretons of the Jungle thrived, dealing regularly with merchants from Saint George. Eventually $COUNTRY$ managed to make them accept its domination in $YEAR$, but they would keep their particularism and their language well beyond the XXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN1.T;The fate of Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.D;Southern Lotharingia has been taken back by our valiant troops, with the Anglican flag finally put down after all these years of pseudo-independence. We have taken back our land to see it filled with weird Protestant sects and powerful cattle owners styling themselves 'Barons', and one of the main reasons of their backwardness. \n \n Now is the time for us to decide how to administrate these lands and especially the property. The land here has been forcefully taken by a few landlords following the treacherous agreement of 1817 and we could take the occasion of the conquest to open the vast plains to foreign settlement, at the expanse of the locals' loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.A;We must respect the Southerners as full Lotharingian citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.B;We will force them to become part of the civilized world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.T;New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.D;New-Mercia has been for some years already integrated in our nation but the fact remains that Edward's Landing is not easily reachable. The Andine passes are scarce and not usable during winter, and many bureaucrats in our government prefer to round Land's End rather than take the land road. Already the frontier spirit has made the local Beornians quite different from their brothers and sisters across the Andes and it has been suggested that we could recognize a local autonomy to New-Mercia which could certainly help their development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.A;Set up a local government in Edward's Landing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.B;New Mercia is as Beornian as Camelot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.T;The English Monarchy in exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.D;Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga. Even if technically independent earlier than Amazonia, this land was only settled by English settlers from the Lotharingian colony during the XVIIth century, crossing the Odon river and destroying the short-lived settlement of Argentine. Living in small towns often unknown by the Lotharingian governor, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture. From that chaos, emerged strong landowners, that rule over the lands like feudal lords. One of them, Harold Cavendish proclaimed himself King 'of the house of England' in 1822. Now his son Edward rules, and the path of possibles is open for the young European-educated King who must choose between the traditional mindset of the Cattle Barons and the new ideas he learnt and practised in Prague and have become shared in the cities of the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.A;Long live Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.T;20 years of independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.D;Beornia was recognized as a separate entity in 1817 by the Charlemagne agreement that saw the colonial governor of Lotharingia agreeing to name the Cattle Baron Harold Cavendish, 'Lieutenant-Governor of the Crown colony of Southern Lotharingia'. While Beornia was only recognized independent in 1822 by the Lotharingian revolutionaries, it was the first act that split the lands across the Odon and the Bernicia from the rest of the colony. Not many celebrations were held, for the monarchy celebrates the Crowning of Harold rather than the agreement that allowed him to rise to power under Burgundian authority. But for Edward, who recalls these events as the reason for being sent away to the wonders of Europe, it seems that date was of special interest for he took the occasion to summon the rump Parliament in Camelot in two weeks for 'an important occasion'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.A;What does the young man want ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.T;The Parliament session;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.D;When Harold crowned himself King of Beornia in 1822, he decided to create a Parliament based on the English Parliament of old. But he never meant for the Commons and Lords to have but an advisory role, and he seldom summoned sessions. His son has seen much throughout Europe, in his years of studies, studying the Constitutions and seeing the ways of ruling. Edward has big plans for his country and has wondered for years how to realize them. Autocracy has its advantages and would placate the will of his uncle and the Cattle Barons but perhaps it is time that the Beornian Parliament becomes a true political power, on the Scandinavian or Burgundian model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.A;The Rump Parliament confirms the absolute power of the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.B;The Parliament is confirmed as a political power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.C;The King's government will now answer to the Parliament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.T;Industry in Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.D;Edward I took great interests in the steelworks of Prague and Anvers during his studies and was always impressed by the new forces of industry that could make small villages, new towns of steel and cement. But in Beornia, the new ideas spread slowly. The Barons of the interior which control nearly all lands in the interior have expressed disinterest or even hatred towards Europe and its new inventions, the most devout seeing it as a tool of the devil. The King has invited many European scholars and some of his old friends to implement changes, but his uncle Charles, leader of the Barons, has asked in a session of Parliament to focus the effort of the monarchy on the interior rather than spending time and money on fruitless efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.A;Barons are the past of this country, we must look to the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.B;We must tend to the earth to not lose the Beornian soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.T;The immigration bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.D;Immigration to Beornia always was quite small. Few people were ready to leave Europe to end up in a poor and forgotten land and the Beornians only welcomed English among their own. The King has decided to regulate immigration formally but he has seen opposition from the old guard who holds true the words of the previous sovereign 'No tainted blood should spoil the virgin soil of our England in exile'. they ask that the Bureau of Immigration be used to ensure that only White Anglo-Saxon Protestants should be able to enter the country. A compromise faction wants to enlarge the criteria to include all Protestants, even not Germanic, while Liberals and captains of industry want to attract from everywhere in Europe, be they Jewish or Papists. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.A;Beornians can tolerate anyone, open immigration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.B;We should ensure that no Papist set foot here but we will not look their ancestry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.C;English blood recognizes its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.T;The Gordon riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.D;The Immigration Bill had attracted vigorous criticism from the Church and the devout who saw the authorization of non-Protestant immigrants as a moral failure of the government and the King. Tensions have been high in Camelot for months, especially as the Bauernite preacher William Gordon denounced the Popish plot that had infiltrated the Beornian government to usher in the arrival of the Antichrist. they erupted in a violent pogrom as a Catholic mission was burnt and the priest beaten up and nearly hanged before the Royal men-at-arms could intervene. The demonstration could hardly be controlled by the police and it took the intervention of the regiments stationed in the capital to end the riots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.A;Beornia cannot change what it is by signing a piece of paper;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.T;The Camelot insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.D;As the policies of the King followed the vision of his uncle Charles and more generally the Cattle Barons, the absolute and reactionary rule of the monarchy began to become more criticized in the coastal cities and the capital. Widely unpopular there, shadow conspiracies working with the bludgeoning docker and workers trade unions sought to destroy the monarchy and proclaim a Republic. Now the day has come, several quarters of the capital have risen up and the fate of Beornia seems undecided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.A;The Republic of Beornia is proclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.B;The Monarchy defeats the seditious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.T;The Republic triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.D;The Absolutist rule of the Beornian kings has been widely criticized in Europe for decades, many agreeing that this rump country deserved such a government given its general population. But in a surprising move, parts of the armies rose against the monarchy in the capital and forced the King to flee to exile, proclaiming another free Republic in the New World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.A;Long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.T;Victory of the Beornian Republicans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.D;The Absolutist rule of the Beornian kings has been widely criticized in Europe for decades, many agreeing that this rump country deserved such a government given its general population. But in a surprising move, parts of the armies rose against the monarchy in the capital and forced the King to flee to the region of New Mercia where he has been hailed by the locals as the rightful King. The future will tell if the monarchy can endure in Edward's Landing or if the Republicans will march across the Andes to end the independence of their former colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.A;A sad victory ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.T;Victory of the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.D;The Beornian capital lies in rubble as the army sweeps the last bastions of the insurrection that tried to overthrow King Edward I of Beornia. The Parliament has been purged from its seditious members and the government has been forced to acknowledge again the power of the King. It seems that Freedom does not flourish everywhere in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.A;Long live Edward I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.T;Victory of the house of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.D;The Beornian capital lies in rubble as the army sweeps the last bastions of the insurrection that tried to overthrow King Edward I of Beornia. The Parliament has been purged from its seditious members and the government has been forced to acknowledge again the power of the King. However the Republican cause is not all dead in the South of Ameriga : the autonomous region of New-Mercia has declared independence hearing about the massacres in Camelot and severed all ties with Beornia and the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.A;Will they stay independent ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.T;Death of Charles of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.D;The last decades have seen a lot of changes in Beornia, often criticized by the Cattle Barons but nonetheless seen as needed by most of the population. Yesterday, the head of the aristocratic faction died. Brother and uncle to kings, Charles had incarnated the aristocratic stubbornness and was seen by many as a relic of the chaotic post-independence time. With their charismatic leader gone, most of the Cattle Barons and preachers from the interior have now decided to accept the new Beornia and it seems that tensions between the coast and the interior have declined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.A;A united nation is the best thing we can hope for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.T;The Barons' War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.D;The aristocrats of Beornia have been a thorn in Edward(s projects since his takeover. Among them his uncle has become a serious rival over the years, rallying devouts and aristocrats worried about the new course of things. Yesterday he and his followers marched on Camelot with several members of the armies joining the hero of independence on its way towards the Palace. Now Edward must choose between accepting the coup or fighting back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.A;The coup is crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.B;The Barons win;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.T;The Barons Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. They attempted to have the King's uncle take power by a coup but were crushed in the attempt as Edward I refused to lay down his power. Now his uncle has been put under house arrest while many Barons had their lands confiscated and redistributed, securing the flame of freedom in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.A;Long live Edward and the Parliament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN17.T;The Barons War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN17.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. Edward accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN17.A;A grim future for a grim country;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN18.T;The Barons War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN18.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. When they arrived, Edward had already fled on a ship to New Mercia where he was hailed as the rightful King when he arrived weeks after his uncle had been crowned in Camelot. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society, 'from one ocean to the next'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN19.T;English red;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN19.D;'The Beornians are a'thick with red, from the flags they bear, to their clothes, to the very essence of their being. If you ever thought the vatican had their fair plate of the dye, then I'd say the Beornians got the whole pot.' \n\n Cochineal red has been our mainstay colour ever since James Oakes looted the insects & the dye from an incan outpost back in the 17th century, it has been perhaps, the one good mainstay of economic life for many smaller, sedentary families in the west of our country. It's bright colour, waving in every street of our cities, towns and villages. All who live in these great plains know that when the tide of red is on the horizon, you better be wearing red too. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN19.A;Better red then dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.T;A curious family reunion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.D;A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as Jean de Courtenay, a French explorer on his way to the Pacific, was thrown out the Carter household. He said to have taken the opportunity to visit his distant cousins, claiming that the Carters were Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650. It came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen : John Carter, a cattle baron close to the Royal family,  had formalized English grammar while his son and heir Alfred was a renowned historian on Anglo-Saxon times. To learn that an Anglois would try and slander their good name was the grievest insult they could have received and they acted accordingly, throwing him to the street and shouting at him until he left. Nonetheless, the claims of de Courtenay were validated years later in a famous history book on the Argentine colony that produced papers signed by Henri de Courtenay, the man that had betrayed the colony in exchange for a guarantee of protection for his properties. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.A;A shocking story;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN21.T;Beornian industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN21.D;You built up industry like Edward wanted, glory to Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN21.A;The old world burns in the fires of industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.T;The Camblesforth raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.D;Life on the Beornian frontier can be harsh, as cattle herders and their families must face the hardships of the Beornian interior alongside the threat of the savages that squat the lands. Or so claims Charles of Beornia that was called to the capital by his nephew following the news of the Camblesforth raid. Producing several witnesses, he justified his expedition against a Mapuche tribe, claiming that he did what the Royal army could not do : protect innocent Christian folks from heathen demons. The court was especially moved by the fate of Amelia Goodman, who had been kidnapped by a Mapuche group and forced to marry by force his captor. Edward who had wanted to punish his uncle for the burning and massacre of an entire village to reduce his influence in the interiror was thus forced to accept the testimonies and let his uncle go, with even more popularity than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.A;He did well I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.T;Nemec Cotton;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.D;Wolfgang Nemec was a close friend of Edward he met in Prague during his study years in Europe. Last son of a Bohemian noble, he took an interest for cultivation during his youth and became one of the leading agronomic engineers in Europe. Visiting Beornia to look through the soils and the way to better cultivation in the kingdom of his old friend, he presented Edward with a plan to cultivate cotton as a new crop in the kingdom. Having studied suitable plots of lands in Eoferwic, Nemec was given by royal decree the empty fields to cultivate his cotton. Soon a great success, it however clashed with local gentry who had used these as grazing lands for their herds and tried several times to have the cotton removed for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.A;Progress of industry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.T;A preacher's word;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.D;The Church of Beornia is a very decentralized Christian confession with a lot of variation in creed and practices throughout the Beornian parishes. The Anglican convention was established by the monarchy during independence to regulate the faith under the supervision of the King but it had few effects outside of urban parishes. For example, in the interior, the cult of Saint Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon King of England spread following the preaching of Branson Cromwell, a priest from Sharow. The convention tried several times to have him revoked but his charisma entitled him the support of his parish and the most devout throughout the country. One of his lasting legacy besides the cult of Harold was his insistence on marriage and births, claiming as Abraham was promised to have 'his seed greatly multiply as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore', it was needed by the Beornians to abide by the decrees of God and multiply so that their seed shall possess the gate of their enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.A;Amen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN25.T;Saltvick's method;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN25.D;Jonathan Saltvick was a member of the so called Edwardian circle, this gathering of various European nobles and bourgeois he had met during his studies and that he entertained over the years in Camelot or during his travels. An engineer from Scotland, he was responsible for determining that the river cities could utilise the river power to establish water mills by creating concentrated water flows and manipulating flood water with wheels. Having secured royal funding, he started in New Jerusalem a system of small-time businesses with semi-automated water-powered processes. Due to him, New Jerusalem boomed with Riverside businesses and his method became a common mark along the Silver River and a common sight in Beornian paitings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN25.A;Let money and water flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.T;A mutinous welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.D;The Bounty was an Anglois ship from Liverpool that sailed from England in $YEAR$ to cross the Horn and sell goods in Zhourao. The captain, Auguste Blanc, a Frenchman, had hired a crew composed mostly of Englishmen notably for their small wages and directed the ship like a dictator. The crew conspired against him and had him put under the brig after he had one of his men whipped for having interpreted his talk in English to be an insult. The crew then sailed to New London where they were met as heroes by the population after their explanation of their act.

AZFL1.T;La Petite Argentine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZFL1.D;;Amazonie does not have too many special holidays, but for one region in particular, today marks an important one indeed. The City of Le Nouveau Havre marks it's 200th Anniversary of the exodus of most of the families that inhabit the city from their original colony, renamed Camelot by the English that drove them out. The former Port, dedicated to the Anglois Silver Fleet, was under protected & undervalued by Anglois authorities, wanting to permit every last ounce of silver to come back to Europe. The colony was finally lost as the invading Beornians captured and looted the city in 1667 but its people carried with them their spirit and culture. The region of the Havre is known as the "Little Argentine", for that was the name of the Anglois colony and were you to ask how the inhabitants would identify themselves, they'd say proudly that they are Argentins. The only problem that arose was that a Beornian trader was thrown into the port -but saved by bystanders- as the crowd shouted 'On se souvient!' (we remember);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF2.T;Rivenzi's Silk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF2.D;Matteo Rivenzi was an Italian immigrant from Lucca that ended up settling in Lotharingia after independence, fleeing political infighting in the Duchy as he has been a notable Republican during the Etrurian wars. A silk worker, he worked to introduce silkworms in Lotharingia and was successful in establishing a reliable silk industry in Transfleuve, being awarded a national award by De Aigle for having helped his country as a true Lotharian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF3.D;Cattle herding has been the economical backbone of the southern Lotharians, the figure of the vacher fighting for his freedom, being an important part of the national mythos. But as cities grow, cattlers old grazing grounds are bought by urban people and the rural herds are pushed more and more to the interior. A series of demonstrations took over the country as cattlers gathered their herds and marched into the cities to demand that their ancestral cattlers rights be respected by urban Lotharians and the authorities. The most known of these cattle demonstrations occured in $YEAR$ when the cattlers walked on Fort Lothère, severely disrupting the capital for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF4.T;Nouvelle-Anglie against Carijoux;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF4.D;The city of Nouvelle-Anglie was established in 1704 near Domecy by Anglo-Lotharian settlers on an island that had belonged to a Carijoux tribe. The Carijoux were promised by contract that the rights of their tribe would be protected but in 1785 they were killed and forced to flee from their homeland after an incident between a settler and a Carijoux ended up in a fight. They were marginalized and most thought that no New-Anglian would heard of them again. But in $YEAR$, Louis-François Carijien, descendant of the Carijoux tribe and respected lawyer decided to try the New-Anglia city for crimes against the rightful owners of the land. The jury ended up legitimizing the acts of the settlers against the tribe, but this was an affair that put the Natives' right in front of the national politics for years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF5.D;Jacques Rosenthal is the most known Lotharian playwriter. Born in France, he had settled in Lotharingia to flee a duel prosecution and had created a big cultural scene in the capital, gathering artists and mecenas from the whole nation. But his latest work has provoked outrage in the devout. His playwright called 'The Blood of June' recalls a love-story between a Catholic woman and a Protestant man during the Anglo-French wars of religion. Mary and Joseph, the lovers of the play, end up separated by their respective families with Joseph being prosecuted by church authorities and condemned to the pyre. The play ends with Mary joining him on the pyre and their respective fathers lamenting on their acts. For Protestant devouts, this play is immoral and instills dangerous values for the youth of Lotharingia. As Rosenthal must face trial for blasphemy and immorality he is ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF7.D;'Great Motherland' was written during the Lotharian war of independence by the young poet Charles Dumas who died soon after being captured by loyalist forces. This poem remained mostly unknown until it was rediscovered by the opera writer Jean-Louis Mazel who put into music and made it the grand moment of his opera 'the rise of the Eagle'. Following the first representations, the song was widely popular and was played in many occasions by the general population. By the end of the XIXth century it had become as popular as the official anthem, the military march 'de l'independance' and would eventually be approved in $YEAR$ as the new anthem of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF8.T;Henri Libre against Manfred Rosedan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF8.D;Henri Libre was one of the countless slaves freed following the abolition of slavery. Born in the plantation of Manfred Rosedan, he was punished for having tried to flee by his master personally with having one of his eyes gouged in public. Later in his life, he lost his left hand while operating the sugar mill. When he was freed, he appeared as a broken man, his corpse showcasing the abuses of slavery. The Negro Integration society decided to help him by putting his former master on trial. This became one of the most known trials of Lotharian society in $YEAR$ as it opened again the wounds of slavery. To add to the national importance of this trial, Rosedan was at the time mayor and soon to be nominated Senator thanks to his contacts in government. Eventually the judge decided that ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF9.D;During the independence war, de Aigle had established the Légion Noire, a military force composed of Black freedmen to fight the Burgundians. A small force, derided by the upper staff, it attracted many unemployed Blacks following the abolition of slavery. The army counted on these units to serve as cannonfodder but they established a reputation for discipline and valor over the years. The 14th Lotharian regiment of the Légion Noire, known popularly as the Black Jaguars was thus the most distinguished Lotharian unit in the XIXth and early XXth century. The Jaguars Noirs ended up as a propaganda source in peace times showcasing the abilities of the Black people and their will to integrate in Lotharian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF10.D;'Notre serment de loyauté à la Lotharie' was a famous pamphlet from the Anglo-Lotharian writer Charlie Oswald that was famously recognized as the cornerstone of Anglo-Lotharian integration. In his book, Oswald claimed that while they shared ties with their Beornian cousins, English people were as much a part of the Lotharian national fabric as Burgundians and that Lotharingia was now their new homeland. he called for his fellow Anglo-Lotharians to integrate even more into society and accept their shared legacy, especially in Odonia. Notably unloved in Beornia, it solidified the split between the Beornians and those they soon called 'Latin Saxons'. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

He is dedicated to right his families wrongdoings with his vast fortune. His most famous achivement is the "Goyon's school for the disenfranchised", a dedicated school to the Afro-frankish and Natives in Port-Sucre, which brings a modern education for those discriminated elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND1.T;The Realm of the Four Parts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND1.D;For four hundred years, the sons of Inti have ruled Tawantinsuyu, Realm of the Four Parts. Our empire once encompassed much of the western spine of the continent called Ameriga by the foreign barbarians, but which our ancestors have known only as home since the dawn of creation. We were not the first to attempt to build a domain here, but we have far exceeded all who preceded us. Guided by our wise Sapa Inca, the son of the Sun, we have resisted the vile Spanish Empire to the north, as well as its bastard sons, the Granadans and Caladerans, who raided our holy capital decades ago. Some blasphemers whisper that we are cruel, but they are fools - we rule with the firmness which is necessary to survive, without which there would still be nothing but chaos. It is our duty, mandated by the Creator, to render order upon his creation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND1.A;The Sons of Inti shall not perish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND2.T;Death of the Sapa Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND2.D;For over half a decade, the Sapa Inca was busy in the south, putting down a revolt by the insolent Mapuche people. The fighting had been fierce, as the Mapuche are stubborn and inhabit a rough and distant part of the continent. Recently, the royal court learned that the revolt had finally been crushed – but at a terrible cost. As our ruler was leading the assault upon the Mapuche capital, he was ambushed by a group of veteran enemy warriors. Although he fought with ferocity, he was ultimately slain in battle, and did not live to see his favored son, Prince Llapa Yupanki, seize the capital and finally crush the rebellion. Llapa sent an earnest appeal for peace and calm via quipu to the capital as soon as the Sapa Inca died, but already Llapa’s elder brother, Prince Washkar Inka, is beginning to dispute Llapa’s right to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
AND2.A;Who shall inherit the realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.T;Two Princes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.D;Just as we feared, the question of succession between Prince Llapa and Prince Washkar has only grown worse since news of the Sapa Inca’s death became public knowledge. Each man’s strengths and weaknesses are well known. Washkar is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inca, respected by the nobility for avenging the Rape of Cusco and punishing the Granadans, but he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast, Llapa Yupanki, while technically not first in line according to Inca law, was the Sapa Inca’s chosen heir, and is a keen diplomat and administrator, yet his non-confrontational style is disdained by many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inca will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of Tawantinsuyu?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.A;Washkar is the natural heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND3.B;Llapa was the chosen heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.T;Washkar and the Coricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.D;The Coricancha, the House of the Sun, is the most important temple in all of Tawantinsuyu. Staffed by the Mama-cunas, the temple priestesses, it was once a place of ornate splendor befitting the house of Inti with statues and even interior walls covered in gold. Ravaged by the savage Granadans, it has not yet regained its grandeur but is still a place of reverence. Traditionally, the Sapa Inca is expected to spend a certain amount of their time conducting religious rituals at the Coricancha, leading ceremonies by day and performing sacred astrology by night. Washkar, however, has been neglecting his duties to focus on preparing for the civil war which he is certain is imminent. Now, the Willaq Umu (Recounting Priest, leader of the clergy) and a group of pious panacas (Cuscan priest-nobles), some of the most important men of the realm, have met with Washkar regarding his aloofness. While they hold him in great respect, they are troubled and disquieted by his disregard of his religious duties at the Coricancha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.A;Washkar will set some time aside in the morning and night for rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND4.B;Chants and stars are nothing compared to the fight for the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.T;The Colla Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.D;When the hated Granadans despoiled sacred Cusco, it was the people of the Titicaca basin which granted the royal court shelter, and from whose people Washkar raised the army which took revenge upon them, even slaughtering their leader, Jose de Herrera. In the time since the atrocity, the region has further grown, matching and perhaps even exceeding the importance of Cuzco itself. Many of the local ayullus (lords), however, come from the Colla people. Though the Colla played a vital role in Washkar’s campaign against the Granadans, they are still looked down upon by the Inca lords, and even the mightiest Colla lord is nothing before the least of the Inca.Yet their support would be quite useful to bolster Washkar’s ranks, and the loyalty of such a centrally located and prosperous region would be a great asset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
AND5.A;For their great service, Waskhar will name many of their lords Inca-by-Privilege. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND5.B;The Prince is not so desperate as to petition the Colla again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.T;The Time for Battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.D;With most of Washkar Inka’s preparations completed, only a final decision remains to be made. Washkar’s rival, Prince Llapa, is known to be a cautious man, and therefore may take some time before he moves against Washkar. Thus, the elder prince believes that he should take advantage of Llapa’s hesitance to attack as soon as possible, while Llapa is still unready, and crush him before he can consolidate his forces. There is a chance that doing so might color him as a usurper and backstabber in the eyes of the people, especially the lords whose loyalty is still uncertain. It would also be counting on Llapa’s hesitance to merely be the result of indecision, and not him laying some sort of trap for Washkar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.A;We shall wait and plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND6.B;Courage dictates us to advance and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.T;The Matter of Cavalry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.D;As Prince Washkar and his generals are making their final preparations for the civil war to come, the question of tactics arises. Washkar believes that, in their first engagement with Prince Llapa, he should personally lead a cavalry charge to shatter Llapa’s ranks after they fire their first volley, taking Llapa’s men while they are still reloading their guns and thus vulnerable. The prince asserts that there is no better way to inspire his men to victory than for them to see their leader out in front, blazing a path for the rest of his soldiers to follow. It is true that Washkar is an expert rider and is beloved by the imperial horsemen. This proposal, however, has unnerved his generals, who fear that Washkar could be placing himself in danger by taking such a prominent battlefield role, especially due to rumors of Llapa bringing a large amount of cannons back north from the Mapuche lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.A;A leader must LEAD! Forward, men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND7.B;Perhaps they are right, why take the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND8.D;Ever since the Sapa Inca’s death, battles have been fought across Tawantinsuyu by those who supported Prince Washkar and those who supported Prince Llapa. Now, at last, a winner has emerged : Prince Llapa. What he believed would be a straightforward conflict instead turned into a grueling struggle which raged across the imperial heartland. Even where their main armies did not clash, the struggle among the polarized aristocracy has riven the empire and dealt a severe blow to its economic and social stability. Though Llapa has finally been coronated Sapa Inca in an ornate ceremony, much of the country still bears deep wounds, and the bitter political animosity which the two brothers’ succession dispute unleashed has been taken as a dark omen. Perhaps the violent political struggles which have plagued the barbarian lands of Europe have finally reached the Realm of the Four Parts…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession, but overall, the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa’s supporters have been less intense than most had feared.

Now, at last, a winner has emerged : Prince Washkar. While Llapa failed to coordinate his forces, Washkar’s strategic cunning guided his faction to victory, enabling them repeatedly outmaneuvering and overwhelming Llapa’s loyalists. Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession, but overall, the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa’s supporters have been less intense than most had feared.

AND12.D;Prince Llapa does not enjoy the thought of fighting his brother for the throne, but he is determined to save Tawantinsuyu from Prince Washkar’s blood-soaked ambitions. As he prepares his forces for the battles to come, the matter of artillery has arisen. Ever since the Inca were introduced to gunpowder by Chinese merchants, the weapons have completely transformed imperial warfare, even though most of them must be imported from more industrialized nations. Now, Llapa is considering whether to bring cannons back north from his recent campaign alongside his father in the south. As few cannons remain in Cusco, this would give Llapa a decisive advantage over Washkar…that is, if they can be brought north in time, which is uncertain, and which has given Llapa reason to wonder if it might be better to forego them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND13.T;The Altiplano Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND13.D;The Altiplano is a vast place, the heartland of imperial pastoralism, and the home of many rich nobles. Their relationship with Cusco has not always been friendly : the campaign to subjugate their people in centuries past was hard-fought, and the retaliations when they rebelled were brutal. While most in Cusco believe that the grievances of the Altiplano are long forgotten, Prince Llapa knows better. He has heard from several supporters in the area that anger against Prince Washkar and the heavy-handed tradition which he represents could be channeled into allegiance towards Llapa with enough time and resources. We must keep in mind that whatever effort Llapa puts into wooing the Altiplano lords is more effort not spent planning his coming struggle with Washkar. Some have advised Llapa that the nobles of the Altiplano would not want to jeopardize their wealth by siding against Washkar, the man who is supported by many other lords in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND14.T;The Question of the Lupaca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND14.D;Among the Aimara people who have risen to prominence since the loss of Chinchaysuyu to the hated Caladerans, the Lupaca people have felt quite neglected. Still looked down upon as brutish and ignorant by the imperial ruling class, Llapa is aware that many Lupaca are bitter that they as a people do not seem to have advanced in society even as their homelands grow more prosperous. Though the Lupaca have a history of perilous relations with the Inca, revolting on more than one occasion (with brutal consequences), Llapa might be able to secure their support in return for raising them to a higher status once he took the throne. Of course, their aid might not be enough to defeat Washkar, and some of Llapa’s own supporters question if the Lupaca can be trusted at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND15.D;Quizquiz was the right hand man of the previous Sapa Inca. Born in the Inca nobility, he was tasked during the Mapuche campaign to consolidate the eastern flank of the army, eventually coming to blows with Beornian raiders who allied with some of the Mapuche tribes in what is now Camblesforth. Ambushed by a combined Mapuche and Beornian force in a mountain corridor, he was forced to flee, but still managed to save most of his men by gathering all the infantry armed with bayonet rifles in a square which his enemy’s cavalry was incapable of breaking. Still considered as the main cause for defeat, he was removed from command and sent to exile in his manor. But as the time of battle draws near, he has sent a messenger to Llapa, pledging to serve his cause and helping neuter Washkar’s ferocious cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This morning, the first railroad in the empire was finally completed with the assistance of Qingqiunese and Burgundian engineers. The railroad consists of a large loop around the Lake Titicaca basin, connecting its cities together. The Sapa Inca himself hammered in the final, golden nail, in a ceremony well attended by foreign observers. While we currently do not have the capabilities to fully enmesh the nation in the rail network, this still represents a tremendous step forwards in our ability to move people and resources around the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND21.A;And so the horse of flesh is joined by the horse of iron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND22.T;Foreign Experts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND22.D;Foreigners are not a rare sight in the Empire. Since the gradual opening of ports to the Burgundians and Qingqiunese in the 16th century, the Incas have kept a strict policy on travel in the Empire, but at the same time have sought foreigners to help with their expertise. Qingqiunese bureaucrats teach the Chinese classics to the Inca nobility, Japanese samurai act bodyguards and smiths, and countless European physicians, engineers and mathematicians can be seen in Cuzco and the Imperial ports. Those who choose this life enjoy a good standard of living, but their actions are monitored by their sponsors, with many of those who have disobeyed their contract being put to jail over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND23.T;Tensions in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND23.D;The Caladerans, holding our beloved Chinchaysuyu hostage for generations, are an omnipresent reminder of our failures. Since the Spanish carved away the northern quadrant of our empire ages ago, we have been estranged from the peoples who previously enjoyed our protection and generosity. Relations between our two states have always been tense, but matters have lately become even colder. Reports have begun to reach Cusco of Caladeran scouts wandering around the border with suspicious regularity. The region is not well-mapped, but for it to be happening so often gives many in Cusco the distinct suspicion that the Caladerans are laying the ground for new hostilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND23.A;We will be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND24.T;Tensions in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND24.D;The Incans have never forgotten or forgiven that our nation is built upon lands conquered from them ages ago by the Spanish crown. While the Spanish tried their best to turn the subjugated peoples away from their savage and pagan ways, it is an open secret that this process was never truly complete. Even now, not just in villages but in towns and even cities, men and women still substitute local gods and idols for “God” or “Jesus Christ.” Previously, this has only bothered reactionaries, but now the Inca have been fortifying their border with speed. We have been attempting to map out the new Inca observation posts and supply depots, but the extensive nature of their buildup gives many in Quito the distinct suspicion that the Inca are laying the ground for new hostilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND25.T;The 400th Year of the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND25.D;Four hundred years ago, the ever-glorious Pachacuti came to rule Cusco, and elevated it into the glorious empire of Tawantinsuyu, crushing all rivals before him, and bringing the light of Inti throughout the known world. By his will, the highlands and lowlands were bound into a single realm, and their peoples united under our magnificent dominion. Despite the coming of the European barbarians, Pachacuti’s empire has endured! In the harshest of climates, we remain a mighty empire, without parallel or peer! Against all depredations, we have persevered, as resilient as the mountains over which we live alongside. Now, Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanqui has brought foreign dignitaries from Europe to demonstrate to them the majesty and power of Tawantinsuyu. From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, our domain resounds with fervent praise to Inti and His son, and the foreigners are awed and perhaps even humbled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND25.A;May we surpass Pachacuti and our descendants surpass us in turn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.T;Ending the Purumauca Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.D;Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanqui is well known as a pragmatic and sagacious ruler, but that does not mean he is cowardly or weak. No, he is a believer in conservation of strength, to be expended when necessary. He is also a veteran of the campaigns against the Mapuche of the south, and remembers vividly the pain of watching his father, the former Sapa Inca, perish on the battlefield at the hands of the Mapuche. Llapa knows that the Mapuche are a cancer upon the empire, always bringing it to grief, and the murderers of his father no less! Therefore, he has decided to end their threat forever. Imperial units selected for their fierce loyalty and hatred of the Mapuche have been dispatched south to carve a path of destruction through the Mapuche homeland of Purumauca. Anyone who survives will be driven back north, either to a set of fortified settlements at the edge of Mapuche lands, or dispersed via the mitma system across Cuntinsuyu. These are the last days of Purumauca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND26.A;They will defy us no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.T;The Chiri Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.D;Sapa Inca Washkar knows that the Mapuche have always been an unruly people, and that they will continue to defy the empire unless something is done. He is also cognizant of his father’s death in battle at their hands, a fact which weighs heavily upon his mind. All the same, he  considers the Mapuche below his attention, given his ambitions. Therefore, he has decided to teach the Mapuche a short, sharp lesson on why their continued obedience is necessary. A military contingent familiar with the lands of Purumauca will head south and shatter the northern Mapuche tribes. Some will be brought to fortified settlements at the northern edge of Purumauca, others dispersed via the mitma system across Cuntinsuyu. A proclamation will then be brought to the southern Mapuche, “confirming” their status as imperial subjects. With such a stern example of the consequences of defiance fresh in their minds, surely they won’t resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND27.A;We have bigger beasts to slay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND28.T;The Military Reforms of Washkar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND28.D;Ever since the end of the struggle with Prince Llapa, Sapa Inca Washkar has been ruminating on the lessons learned during the battles he fought against his brother. He has concluded that what the Inca army most urgently needs is a formalized command structure, with officers schooled in modern European strategies and tactics. Thus, he has created a new system of military ranks for the army, drafted a new training guide, and has brought Burgundian officers to Tawantinsuyu to assist in the training and reorganizing of the officer corps. While these men will be subject to close surveillance and travel restrictions, like all foreigners, Washkar has placed a great -deal of trust in them. He hopes that this will mark the end of the Inca military as a feudal relic, and the beginning of its transformation into an efficient fighting force. The ayullus are greatly displeased, but most of them have recognized Washkar’s tremendous popularity and resigned themselves to a future without a fully aristocratic army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND29.T;A Beornian Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND29.D;For generations, loyal sons of Beornia have carried out holy crusades against the heathen Inka of the north. Some in Camelot question if armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons attacking the Inka Empire is a wise idea, but they have become something of folk heroes to the citizens of our frontier. Our recent liberation of part of the Inkan frontier a few years ago has only strengthened their resolve. Recently, yet another assault was launched against some Inkan villages near the Beornian border. As far as we can tell, the raiders moved swiftly through the towns with fire and sword, before returning home in triumph. Rumors that Prince Charles, the notorious uncle of King Edward, had led the attack gained the participants even further glory. Though most in Camelot have expressed their approval at the news, some fear that this incident may finally push the Inka over the edge and drive them to seek revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

These insane savages, crazed in worship to their so-called god (whom we have on good authority is considered bizarre even by other barbarians), believe that they are undertaking some sort of holy war when they ride their horses across our border and terrorize our communities. The recent occupation of the southernmost sliver of our realm by Beornia a few years ago has only emboldened them. Recently, yet another mob of unwashed farmers waving rusty blades and antique guns has trespassed into Tawantinsuyu, attacking several frontier villages and even setting a few on fire. Apparently a barbarian lord and relative of their king named Charles led the attack himself! The exact damage of the event is hard to verify, but many Cusco officials have lost their patience with Beornia and are urging Sapa Inca Llapa to seize the opportunity to finally punish the delusional barbarians of the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND32.D;We have received a missive from the northern savages of the Inka Empire. It seems that their despot, Llapa Inka, has decided that our holy realm poses a threat to his nation. However, rather than make war upon us, he has offered to partition the mountain range which runs across our domains. His emissaries have made the case that coming to an agreement on the frontier would be far preferable to a clash between our armies to settle the matter. They have appended this statement with a warning that if Beornia rejects this offer, they will “inflict such desolation upon Beornia the likes of which it has never known before.” Shall we cave in to these savages or show them Christian fury?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

In Beornia proper, Edward I has rallied all the forces of the country to help defeat the coming storm.

AND38.D;To the astonishment and horror of all worshippers of Inti, the Beornian savages have bested the imperial armies. A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the Sapa Inca was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside. The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to the barbarian capital of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being. Tawantinsuyu and its Sapa Inca have been humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND39.D;The conquest of New-Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that their conquest was just because of the Inca aggression. New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers. However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt. When the Beornians did not act directly, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND41.D;Not since 1066, on that evil day when the Norman usurpers forced the yoke of slavery upon the Anglo-Saxon neck, have the faithful sons of England known such dark times as this. The savage Inkan despot has driven the whole Beornian Army from the field and arrived under arms at the gates of Camelot. He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept. /n /n The Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises alongside the imperial puma banner across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. $GET_YEAR$ will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND42.D;As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of Tawantinsuyu to surround the barbarian capital of Camelot. Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to the sons of Inti. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current barbarian occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their pathetic nation and their false god, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

We have taken control of several regions formerly under their control, and mitma resettlement has already begun in the conquered provinces. The current barbarian occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their pathetic nation and their false god, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND44.D;Washkar said that Beornia would be conquered and she was. He entered Camelot at the head of his army and gave his soldiers one order: “Surpass de Herrera.” The Royal Palace was torched, and the whole Beornian royal family captured and assembled before the Inca. After forcing them to bow and acclaim him as their sovereign, they were then impaled before the smoldering remnants of their city’s cathedral. The corpse of Prince Charles, unofficial perpetrator of the raid that led to the war, was flayed alive publicly, with his skin being fashioned into a war drum, and his skull gilded as Waskhar's personal drinking vessel. Following the conquest, Washkar sent officials throughout his new lands promising them a quiet life if they obeyed the Imperial commandments, reminding them of what awaited any rebel. European merchants have relayed the “Doom of Camelot” with horror, with many people in the Old Continent only now discovering that the city even existed. Now, all Ameriga watches the South with fear, for who knows whom the fury of the Inca will strike next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND45.T;A New Neighbor in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND45.D;Tawantinsuyu, the empire of the Inca, has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians and reduced them to the region of Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent, expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well. Beornian refugees are already fleeing across the border, telling tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca, and now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task, however, so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with Tawantinsuyu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND46.T;The Viceroyalty of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND46.D;In the days of Burgundian colonial rule, Beornia was once merely the southern section of the Viceroyalty of Lotharingia. The English Lotharians sided with the Viceroy during the Lotharian Civil War, and declared independence after the Lotharian patriots prevailed over the loyalists. Now that Beornia has been so radically reduced, Chef de Aigle is considering whether to lay claim to the former extent of Beornia owing to our colonial legacy. Doing so would provide justification for fighting back against the Inca advance and protecting our fellow Euro-Amerigan Protestants (eccentric as they are). As this would be a colossal undertaking in which we would have to assault the mightiest nation in Ameriga, some advocate recognizing the new borders of Beornia and Tawantinsuyu and seeking to avoid conflict with the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND47.D;We had hoped that we could spend some time consolidating our new southern lands before we continued our struggle against the foreign barbarians. This was not to be. The preening, pretentious savage of Lotharingia known as “Chef de Aigle” has made an absurd claim to all of former Beornia! His diplomats referenced the former extent of an old Burgundian colony when they tried to explain the situation to us, but our Sapa Inca would not hear it. He replied to them that if Lotharingia sought war with Tawantinsuyu, he “would not keep them waiting,” and our armies have already begun to be mobilized to the frontier. Lotharingia shall be the next barbarian realm to submit to our indomitable strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND48.D;Many Lotharians privately doubted whether we could defeat Tawantinsuyu. Once again, Chef Denis de Aigle proved his doubters wrong and brought Lotharingia glory. The Inca armies were totally shattered, and their Sapa Inca was forced to surrender all his southern conquests. With this overwhelming triumph, de Aigle has enough popular support to organize a constitutional convention. This will ground Lotharingia on solid legal foundations and enshrine his legacy as the greatest Lotharian of all time! The only question is what form of government Lotharingia shall assume. There has been profound pressure from the Atlanteans to restore power to the people. A growing number of Lotharians would prefer a republican federation to accommodate our new lands, but there is an alternative : crown de Aigle as King Denis I! Being a parliamentary monarch would reduce de Aigle to a mostly symbolic role, but it would prevent the Atlanteans from removing him entirely, and even the weakest monarch has ways to influence a nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND49.D;Lotharingia has broken the satanic Inkans and driven them back into their desolate mountains. Yet the brutality which they have wreaked upon the Beornian countryside – and the fact that Lotharingia is now making much hay of its status as the “rightful heirs” of the old Burgundian Viceroyalty – makes the restoration of our nation seem unlikely. A proposal has instead been extended by the Lotharian government for us to join their nation as its newest state. Given their newfound hegemony in southern Ameriga, and their status as European-descended co-religionists, perhaps we could find some common ground?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Reduced to Avalon and on the verge of collapse due to refugee overpopulation and lack of farmlands and food, it is unthinkable that such a nation could possibly survive on its own. Furthermore, as all of Beornia is naturally Lotharian land, they belong within our nation. Thankfully, they have seen our side of the matter, and have petitioned for annexation into our glorious country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Inca armies were totally shattered and the Sapa Inca was forced to surrender all his southern conquests. With this overwhelming triumph, de Aigle now has sufficient popular support to reshape the government in his image. While he could continue his benevolent rule, it might be prudent to take this opportunity to set Lotharingia on steadier legal footing. The people would no doubt be grateful if de Aigle was generous enough to create a constitution and call for new elections, inaugurating a democratic era. This might mean the end of his rule, however, which leaves de Aigle with a more attractive option : Crown himself as King Denis I! By becoming a monarch, and drafting a royal charter to grant some basic rights to the people, de Aigle will elevate himself from a politician to a figure of nobility, splendor, and grandeur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND52.D;Despite the best efforts of the Lotharian army, we have been unable to drive out the Inca from the Beornian plains, though they have similarly failed to make substantial gains in Lotharingia. Thus, Le Chef and the Sapa Inca have signed a peace treaty restoring the previous borders of their respective nations. We are without a doubt the worse off, as our attempts to claim Beornia have been thwarted. In exchange for declining to press for any territorial gains from us, the Sapa Inca demanded that we drop all claims to the former southern extent of the Viceroyalty of Lotharingia. De Aigle’s public failure has amplified the voices of his critics, and his rule seems destined to grow even more unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND53.D;The wrath of the Inca has fallen upon a new victim. With the Lotharian army destroyed in the field, the Sapa Inca reached the gates of the capital and threatened to scour the city unless we signed a harsh and bitter peace. The resulting treaty has dismembered Lotharingia. Multiple regions have been given independence, and vast swaths of western territory have been annexed by Tawantinsuyu. This is worse than a failure – this is a catastrophe, and it has de Aigle’s name written all over it. Only he, his critics say, could have conceived of a plan so foolhardy as to seek to conquer all the former Beornia by attacking the Inca head-on. Those who remain within Lotharingia are beside themselves with fury at the man whose vanity and ambition led him to provoke such a ruinous war with the Inca. As the Inca march onwards, the future of Le Chef is bleak. People have poured out into the streets in protest, calling not merely for his resignation, but for his arrest and trial for treason, for his execution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

These foreign barbarians, who once spoke of us as “pagan hordes” and “savage primitives,” now refer to us with, if not respect, then certainly a newfound circumspection. While certain powers such as Spain have withheld recognition of us out of spite, others, such as Burgundy, have elevated their presence within Cusco to diplomatic offices befitting communication with an equal international partner.

AND56.D;Decades ago, Ballivian descended upon Cusco alongside two of the finest men he has ever known : Jose de Herrera and Guillermo de Blanco. They found untold riches in the Inca capital, but the Inca inflicted a brutal revenge, killing de Herrera and rampaging all the way to Chan Chan. Ever since that day, Ballivian has been planning his revenge against the Inca. He knows that so long as they are strong, Caladero will never be secure, and Ameriga will never be safe. Thus, he has now decided to slaughter the Inca puma once and for all! The coming war shall determine the fate of western Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND56.A;This time we will not leave even Cusco’s foundations standing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.T;The Andine War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.D;Decades ago, three barbarian warlords transgressed upon the sacred city of Cusco and inflicted horrid blasphemies upon it. Washkar Inca led a campaign of righteous retribution against them, killing their leader and marching all the way to Chan Chan. But if the Caladeran savages thought that time would lessen our grief or dull our memories of those agonizing days, they thought wrong! We have neither forgotten nor forgiven their atrocities. Now, Tawantinsuyu is strong and proud, whereas Caladero has recently been convulsed by political turmoil. The time has come to finish what we started so many years ago and wipe Caladero from the map! Chinchaysuyu shall be liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND57.A;The puma shall devour the eagle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.T;The Treaty of Arequipa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.D;For the second time this century, we have been humiliated by the Caladerans. The imperial armies were bested in the very mountains and valleys of our ancestors, and the foreign savages surged south. Imperial rule collapsed under the weight of the fiasco, the Sapa Inca vanishing during riots which convulsed the capital. In the aftermath, Ballivian reorganized Tawantinsuyu. Vast swaths of the empire have been pried away by barbarians, while a new and brutal system has arisen within. Highland groups with historical grievances against the Inca have been made lords of the region with Caladeran overseers. Meanwhile, the lowlands are being set aside for Caladeran resettlement. The Caladerans are now speaking of the mita system in ways which imply the ownership of resettled peoples by their local governor, and a puppet Sapa Inca has been installed by Ballivian. Every aspect of the empire is being appropriated by Euro-Amerigan colonialism. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is an empire no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND58.A;The sons of Inti have perished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.T;The Treaty of Arequipa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.D;Our total victory over the southern savages has at last been secured. It seems that their ruler was lost in the chaos of riots which gripped their capital when news of our impending victory leaked out. We have thus taken this opportunity to reorganize the Inca state to suit our interests. Natives with historical grievances against the Inca have been appointed as overseers of the highlands, while the lowlands are being cleared out for settlement by civilized peoples. Our jurists are already drawing up a new Tawantinsuyu “charter” which will codify the old customs of the Inca in ways which serve Caladero. Of particular interest is the mita system of labor, which should give our colonial administrators and new landlords an excellent way of keeping their lands productive and putting those brutes to work. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is now merely our trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND59.A;And civilization – unforgiving as it is – has finally come to the Andes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.T;The War in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.D;Ever since de Herrera, de Blanco, and Ballivian led their attack on the Inca city of Cusco, tensions between our two nations have been high. The Inca dismissed the very existence of Caladero, claiming that it was “erected upon the foundations of Chinchaysuyu” and demanding our “return” to their empire. Meanwhile, the increasing numbers of immigrants and settlers to our country gives us cause to seek expansion into the Inca lands. There is growing sentiment that the time has come for a decisive clash to settle the matter of which of our two nations is the master of the Andes. If we hesitate, jingoists say, then the wicked Inca will surely strike the first blow. The consequence of failure, however, is likely to be the destruction of Caladero, so we must weigh our options carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.A;To dominate the Andes is our manifest destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND60.B;No, the time is not yet right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND61.T;Convocation of the Knights;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND61.D;Ever since the Inca conquest of Beornia, an increasing number of Beornian refugees have arrived in Nouvelle Amsterdam. They bring tales of the horrid brutality and endless malevolence of the Inca, speaking of their ruler, Sapa Inca Washkar, in terms of absolute evil. Up until now, their presence in Nouvelle Amsterdam has merely altered the local economy (and resulted in Beornians attempting to shut down local bars and brothels on grounds of morality), but now a curious new group has formed. Referring to themselves as the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Albion, they combine the functions of a benevolent society with a political pressure group – and a paramilitary. They provide charitable aid to Beornians in the area, but also demand a hard line against Tawantinsuyu and even train their members in “the sacred rite of combat,” for “the coming crusade.” Some see them as a nuisance, but after the annihilation of Camelot, others in Nouvelle Amsterdam are beginning to consider their paranoia justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND62.T;The Grand Rivière Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND62.D;The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu’s expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inca Washkar, they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Inca aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inka Empire.” Invitations are going out across southern Ameriga, and even Spain and Scandinavia, two powers with tangible Amerigan interests, are expected to send delegates. This could be the beginning of the greatest war that Ameriga has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND67.T;A Venue of Vultures;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND67.D;Sapa Inca Washkar’s efforts to advance the glory of Tawantinsuyu have at last incurred the wrath of the international community. Rumors abound among the foreigners within Cusco that some type of diplomatic meeting is being convened in Lotharingia, where representatives of many nations with grudges against the empire will be in attendance. It seems clear that such a meeting can only be for the planning of a war, unprecedented in scale and scope, against us. As Washkar delves deeper into war planning, all of Tawantinsuyu tenses, like a single muscle ready to spring into action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND67.A;Like a puma ready to leap upon its prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND68.T;The Grand Rivière Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND68.D;Representatives from across Ameriga and Europe convened in Grand Rivière recently to discuss the threat posed by Tawantinsuyu. All powers in attendance agreed that the continued rule of Sapa Inca Washkar, and the occupation of surrounding lands by the Inca, could no longer be tolerated. The Knights of Albion and the Lotharian representatives made impassioned speeches on the insatiable megalomania of Washkar, and the aspirations of Tawantinsuyu for nothing less than total domination of Ameriga. The conference concluded with a joint agreement by the attending powers that they would work in concert and coordinate their forces against the Inca, and issued a declaration of the necessity of the Inca to withdraw from their conquests. Every delegate expects the Inca to refuse…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Thus the Powers are determined to act promptly and unanimously, with the forces necessary for realizing this goal.” – Declaration of Grand Rivière /n /n Since the first clash between the Inca and the Spanish Empires, Tawantinsuyu has struggled against the foreigners. Now the newest chapter in that struggle is about to be written with the blood of thousands of Amerigans. An international coalition has assembled to dismantle the realm of Sapa Inca Washkar, while he seeks to make himself master of the continent. The fate of Ameriga shall be decided upon the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND70.T;The Second Sack of Cusco;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND70.D;Once again, foreign armies have despoiled the sacred heart of Tawantinsuyu. Having seized control of the city of Cusco, $FROM$ armies had free reign of the area, their commanders allowing them to run wild. The result was a cavalcade of rapine and slaughter, with soldiers chiseling gold and silver from the walls of temples and royal palaces, and the most savage atrocities playing out in street after street, men and women subjected to unspeakable acts. Even the House of the Sun was not spared, its golden statues, painstakingly restored by imperial artisans, once again cast down and dismembered. Worst of all was the fate of the royal palace, completely plundered by the foreigners, before, by accident or wicked plan, a fire was started which burned the whole building down. The devastation of Cusco for the second time in decades has spread despair across the empire and augurs ill for our chances of victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND71.T;The Sack of Fort Lothère;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND71.D;The Inca seizure of Fort Lothère has seen a series of atrocities play out, the likes of which surpass even the darkest days of the Lotharingian Civil War. Inca forces, tired and ill-tempered for having marched all the way to the Atlantic coast, were given free reign of the city by Sapa Inca Washkar. The result was a cavalcade of rapine and slaughter, with Inca soldiers toppling statues of de Aigle and carting away their remains, and inflicting acts upon the Lotharians too horrid to speak of. Even the presidential palace was not spared, completely pillaged by Inca soldiers before, by accident or vile plan, a fire was started which burned the whole building down. The unprecedented devastation of Fort Lothère has spread despair across the nation and bodes ill for our chances of victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND71.A;Is nothing sacred to these monsters?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND72.T;The Coalition Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND72.D;Hundreds of years ago, Sapa Inca Pachacuti enlightened his people by teaching them of Inti and how best to give praise to the sun. Now, their descendants, like Icarus of Greek myth, have flown too close to the sun, and been sent plunging into the abyss below. The armies of the coalition defeated the Inca armies after a series of maneuvers along the frontier allowed them entry into the imperial heartlands. Sapa Inca Washkar was cornered by the Coalition armies near Lake Titicaca and perished while leading the final charge against them. After a relative of Washkar was hurriedly coronated as the new Sapa Inca, he was made to sign an exorbitant and punitive peace treaty. Tawantinsuyu has been dismembered, and surrounding nations have stripped away imperial lands. The Inca lands which remain have been devastated by war, their people embittered and traumatized by the tyrant who brought so much suffering to their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND72.A;The sons of Inti have perished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND73.T;The Peace of Hullaqa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND73.D;Despite the best efforts of the foreign hordes, they have been unable to destroy our glorious empire. Yet we, too, have been unable to truly crush our enemies. Thus, as a gesture of his magnanimity, Sapa Inca Washkar has summoned representatives from the enemy coalition to a peace conference in Hullaqa. The effort was less of a serious negotiation and more a gesture of his power : nobody had any illusions that Washkar would surrender his gains. The resulting treaty confirmed the borders of Ameriga as they existed prior to the war. The Lotharian delegates were especially morose at this news, realizing that their western lands were now permanently out of their reach, but the other powers decided that securing peace was more important. While Washkar is privately disappointed that the chance to remake the continent in his image has been lost, he does not show it : publicly, he is exultant in the Inca’s victory over the powers of the Old and New Worlds in the face of overwhelming odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND73.A;In spite of our enemies, we remain unbowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND74.D;We led the charge of all the powers of Ameriga, backed by vaunted European empires, against Tawantinsuyu – and we were annihilated. In battles across Ameriga, the armies of the coalition were shattered by the Inca forces. An armistice has been declared before the final peace terms are handed down to us by Sapa Inca Washkar, but already Incan forces have occupied the western lands of our nation. Meanwhile, with the Lotharian military broken and the nation grinding under the burden of wartime devastation, multiple regions have seceded entirely. New Alsace, Atlantia, and Odonia have all declared independence, with the explicit support of Tawantinsuyu. Lotharingia lies prostrate and bloodied before the irresistible, merciless radiance of the Inca sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND76.D;“There must be war and victory over the enemy in the afterlife, for otherwise it would be devoid of pleasure.” – Sapa Inca Washkar /n /n Four centuries ago, Sapa Inca Pachacuti ascended to the throne Cusco, and thus our empire was born. Now, the journey they began under him has been completed by the only man to surpass him : Sapa Inca Washkar, the Terror of the East. After crushing their combined forces in battle after battle, the heads of the coalition were summoned to Cusco. Washkar greeted them in full imperial regalia, before leading them into the royal palace and bringing them before a map of Ameriga upon a massive table. There they beheld the new order in the continent, which Washkar had already drawn out. There Washkar explained to each of them their new place within “his” continent. The Amerigans were then brought to the House of the Sun, where they all swore fealty to the Sapa Inca. As the imperial banners are raised across the continent, the darkness brought by the European conquistadors is finally receding…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND76.A;And just as we vowed, the blazing rays of Inti illuminate all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
AND77.T;The Purification of Chinchaysuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND77.D;Now that the Realm of the Four Parts once again lives up to its name, we must prevent any possibility of resistance which might allow foreigners to pry Chinchaysuyu away again. All Caladeran and Chimu soldiers and officers will, without exception, be executed. Their knowledge and skills make them too dangerous to be allowed to live, not to mention that they are the most blatant manifestation of the system of conquest which Spain and its inheritors imposed upon Chinchaysuyu. To avoid inspiring their relatives to take revenge, their direct families will also be executed. In addition, the local royal authorities and non-European peoples of the area will be given a relatively free hand to…settle disputes against the foreigners. Combined with a total withholding of all forms of government aid, assistance, or support from them, we should soon be rid of their infection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND77.A;This is sacred work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.T;The End of the Potosi Silver Mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.D;For centuries, Potosi has bestowed the bounty of its silver upon imperial miners. That abundance of wealth has kept our crafters and artisans able to construct beautiful and precious works, to say nothing of its boon to our treasury. Yet while $GET_ADJ$ silversmithing may be well regarded abroad, its fortunes have just gotten dimmer. The latest report from the Potosi engineers shows that outputs from the silver mines have plummeted over the last several years. While a few optimistic geologists continue searching for new veins - the most pious of them making entreaties to Supay, the god of the underworld and a frequent recipient of miners’ prayers - it seems that Potosi’s miners must now turn to more mundane metals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND770.A;Supay gives and Supay takes away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND78.T;Runaqelqasqa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND78.D;Since its founding, Tawantinsuyu has not possessed an alphabet. Quipus, knotted cords used to record data such as tax records, history, messages, and census information, have served us well but are tedious to reproduce. The coming of traders from China, Qingqiu, Japan, and Burgundy caused rudimentary phonetic languages using various symbols to be developed for mercantile purposes. Now a team of imperial amautas (scholars) and European and Japanese linguists led by Llapa have completed a new treatise, “The One Script of Humanity.” It has refined the Runasimi dialects of the imperial lingua franca into one featural alphabet with logographic elements, dubbed Runaqelqasa (“human script”). Inspired by East Asian, Latin, and Arabic languages (especially Korean), it is written in symbols organized into syllable blocks, with numbers represented as groups of dotted lines akin to quipu. Already, new imperial scribes are transcribing quipu into written records. A revolution in imperial literature and education is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND79.T;The Second Industrial Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND79.D;The direction of the imperial court in the economy is an old tradition, even if its actual methods differ from those commonly employed in Europe and Asia. As our technology improves, however, the old systems of mit’a (mandatory public service) and mink’a (local communal work) are no longer sufficient to fulfill our economic objectives. Thus, drawing on foreign techniques and ideas of economic development and state-controlled economics, the imperial court has drawn up a new iteration of an industrialization plan. The “Second Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Realm of the Four Parts,” or simply the “Second Industrial Plan,” calls for the expansion of manufacturing within the empire. It allocates funds for the modernization of farming and mining, as well as grant programs for factory construction. Combined with the Sapa Inca’s industrial advisors from Qingqiu and Burgundy, this will accelerate Tawantinsuyu’s economy into modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND79.A;The plan is law, its fulfillment is duty, and over-fulfillment is honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.T;Emperor of the Socialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.D;One of the Sapa Inca Llapa’s many titles is, “Lover and Benefactor of the Poor.” This has gained new relevance with the growth of socialist movements within Tawantinsuyu. While they have been thoroughly suppressed, Llapa realizes that ending the long-term socialist threat requires absorbing their power base. Thus, he has sought to co-opt the more moderate socialist tendencies to deter republicanism. Working with the rest of the royal court, a new law has been made to introduce paternalistic welfare to Tawantinsuyu. The “Beneficence Act” includes the curtailment of child labor, the strengthening of national health care and hospital funding, and a pension fund for elderly citizens. In a first for our empire, factory workers will be allowed to elect their own managers! The Sapa Inca’s actions have earned him a new popular title : Emperor of the Socialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND80.A;A socialist subject of the empire is still a subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.T;The Great Reorganization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.D;Sapa Inca Llapa and his advisors have concluded that Tawantinsuyu has grown too large for the old system of rule to continue. The concentration of power and authority in Cusco will not suffice if the empire is to continue to expand. Therefore, he has decided to gather the most learned scholars in the realm and draft a proclamation radically redefining domestic governance. Henceforth, each suyu (part) will have an appointed Inca governor with broad internal powers. Beneath them, provincial governorships will consist of meritocratic Inca selection. The advent of a written language for Tawantinsuyu has allowed Sapa Inca Llapa and his advisors to publish and rapidly distribute this new document.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND81.A;All parts equal under Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.T;Selecting an Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.D;As Sapa Inca Llapa grows older, he has come to realize that he must make plans for his succession. Remembering his succession struggle with his brother, Washkar Inca, and having no desire to inflict such things upon his children, Llapa intends to make his choice of heir known and clear. Though Llapa loves his daughters as much as his sons, a female ruler is unthinkable, and so it is his three sons among whom he must choose. The youngest, Sunquyuq Inca, known as “Hurhi” (“George” in the barbarian Beornian tongue), is the governor of the former Beornian lands. He has studied the Beornians and the Europeans and is seen by the former as a decent man, rare among Inca. The oldest, Llipya Sinchiyachiq Inca, governor of Chinchaysuyu, has collaborated with the Sapa Inca on his legislation and is the strongest advocate of Llapa’s “Inca reformism.” The middle son, Sinchi Churan Inca, governor of Collaysuyu, is beloved for aiding the lower class while also being committed to industrial development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.A;Hurhi Sunquyuq Inca knows how to handle the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND82.B;Llipya Sinchiyachiq Inca understands Llapa’s vision the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND83.T;The Travels of Llapa Yupanki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND83.D;With his reform program in place, and the succession settled, Sapa Inca Llapa can finally fulfill his long-held desire to travel the world! While he is gone, his sacred wawqi “brother,” a golden statue representing the other half of his camaquen (life force), will act in his place as ruler of the empire. Though he is particularly interested in touring the great cities and geographic marvels of Europe, he also intends to visit Qingqiu and Japan. At the top of his list of European nations to visit is Burgundy, who has for centuries been Tawantinsuyu’s most important European economic and cultural contact. Llapa has been particularly impressed with news of the exploits of the notorious Jean de Bouillon. Along the way, he will also meet with officials from said governments and furnish Tawantinsuyu’s international image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND83.A;Off we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.D;Sapa Inca Llapa has taken Europe by storm – in terms of popularity, that is. Crowds have gathered in Anvers, Prague, Paris, and all the other great cities of the continent, to behold the legendary Sapa Inca and his royal entourage. European savages may be easily impressed, but the tremendous attention which Llapa and his officials have drawn during their travels surprised even themselves. Whether riding a gondola in Venice, touring the fabulous gardens of Anvers, or cutting a sharp figure near St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, the Sapa Inca has caused more than a few Europeans to reevaluate their views on Tawantinsuyu and the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND84.A;They were starstruck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND85.T;The Emperor and the King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND85.D;It was in Anvers that Llapa met the man he’d most looked forward to meeting during his time in Europe: King Jean de Bouillon of Burgundy. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Jean is perhaps the only European which Llapa sees as remotely comparable to himself. Both Jean and the emperor’s Inca officials were astounded when Llapa – having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit – not only greeted him in flawless Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in that barbarian tongue! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Tawantinsuyu and Burgundy, and their distaste for Catholics. The Sapa Inca’s knowledge of astronomy particularly impressed the Burgundian king. Jean then accompanied the Sapa Inca on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AND86.D;Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanki of Tawantinsuyu (the Inca Empire) has recently been touring Europe, turning heads and drawing crowds across the continent. Anvers, however, held special significance to him, due to his acquaintance with King Jean. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Llapa is perhaps the only non-European monarch whom Jean sees as remotely comparable to himself. Both Jean and the emperor’s Inca officials were astounded when Llapa – having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit – not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in it!

AND87.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND87.D;Out of all the nations of Asia, Japan has captured Sapa Inca Llapa’s attention the most. Enthralled by its culture and language, as well as the industrious capacity of its people, Llapa was eager to see the land so often spoken of by the Japanese bodyguards and royal artisans of Cusco. The Land of the Rising Sun did not disappoint. While European technology and culture have made a limited mark upon Japan, it is still very much steeped in tradition and the ways of the past – much to Llapa’s excitement. Stunning the Japanese with his superb command of their language, the emperor and his entourage took in the marvelous cities and natural landmarks of Japan with wonder. The imperial capital of Kyoto – where the Sapa Inca was received by the Japanese Emperor – was the grandest of all, the beauty of its temples and palaces rendering the Sapa Inca speechless multiple times.

AND88.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND88.D;Out of all the nations of Asia, Japan has captured Sapa Inca Llapa’s attention the most. Enthralled by its culture and language, as well as the industrious capacity of its people, Llapa was eager to see the land so often spoken of by the Japanese bodyguards and royal artisans of Cusco. The Land of the Rising Sun was not quite what he expected. European technology and culture have triggered transformations across Japanese society – much to Llapa’s surprise. Though his deft command of Japanese impressed his hosts, and the grandeur of Japan’s cities and natural landmarks was impressive, the Sapa Inca was perturbed to find Japan so different from how he had imagined it. Even touring Kyoto, the ancient imperial capital, and being received by the Japanese Emperor did not shake Llapa from his disillusionment. In fact, when the Tenno met Llapa in a distinctly European-inspired ceremonial uniform, the Sapa Inca almost gasped in shock. All told, the visit was not as he had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND88.A;At least the geisha lived up to his expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.T;An Inca Visitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.D;Over the past few days, the people of Japan have witnessed something extraordinary : the first ever visit by an Inca Emperor! Sapa Inca Llapa Yupanki of Tawantinsuyu, as part of his diplomatic tour across Europe and the Pacific, recently concluded his visit to our empire. The Sapa Inca surprised many with his good command of Japanese, though his excited fascination with Japanese art and culture was quite unconcealed. His reception in the imperial capital by the Emperor was particularly noteworthy, a splendid ceremony befitting the emperor of the east, the ruler of the only native realm to successfully resist the European onslaught. Tawantinsuyu has long been a fixture in Japanese diplomatic and economic interchange, and this latest episode will only strengthen those bonds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND89.A;He seemed a little too interested in the geishas’ performance, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.T;The Sapa Inca Illuminates Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.D;Next to Burgundy and Japan, Qingqiu is the most influential nation in Tawantinsuyu. For centuries, Qingqiuan merchants have plied the coast, and Qingqiuan scholars have educated ayullus and their children, teaching them literature, science, and philosophy. Tawantinsuyu boasts some of the greatest Confucianists outside of the Chinese sphere. More recently, Qingqiuan engineers have assisted in developing imperial industry and infrastructure. Thus, it was only natural that Qingqiu would be the final stop of the Sapa Inca’s international tour. The nation was wooed by the Sapa Inca, being oddly reminiscent of both China and Tawantinsuyu yet distinctively its own. Llapa’s Sanbaoese, while limited, nevertheless surprised his hosts - he was delighted to meet a small group of men who identified themselves as the University of Sanbao’s Tawantinsuyu scholars! After being received by the Qingqiuan head of state, the Sapa Inca spent his final evening taking in a night of traditional Chinese dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND90.A;A marvelous conclusion of a marvelous journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.T;The Return of the Sapa Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.D;After over two months abroad, Sapa Inca Llapa has finally returned home to Tawantinsuyu. He was received in a magnificent ceremony, with him and the royal family traveling on a special train from the port city of X all the way back to Cusco. The experience has humbled the Sapa Inca, giving him insights on the nations of the world and challenging his conceptions of their peoples. Moreover, the cultural exposure which his court officials received in places such as Burgundy, Japan, and Qingqiu will only continue to influence the ayullus and by proxy the nation at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND91.A;Today, the world has grown smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND92.T;Lastahallpa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AND92.D;Since the discovery of the South Pole, our geographers and scientists have repeatedly expressed the value of establishing a claim to some section of Antarctica. Now, a new law has been passed to formally demarcate Lastahallpa, the “Land of Snow,” Tawantinsuyu’s newest southern territory. While the value of the land itself is little beyond national prestige and scientific data gathering, the expansion of the Realm of the Four Parts to yet another continent is nevertheless a significant milestone in our national history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##DECISIONS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
cusco_capital_title;Restore the Center of the Universe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
cusco_capital_desc;Cusco, the Center of the Universe, has for too many years laid desecrated after the damned Granadans and Caladerans despoiled it. The problem has not simply been a lack of will to restore it. Cusco was constructed over a period of centuries with each generation adding new elements. Rebuilding the city, especially to its prior levels of splendor, is an undertaking requiring substantial resources including significant amounts of precious metals. Now, however, the necessity of restoring the city – and the advancement of our mining and processing technology – has overcome the daunting nature of the task. Not only will the city be restored, but it will also be modernized with architectural and engineering knowledge gleaned from the foreigners. Most of all, the Coricancha, the House of the Sun, will be restored to its full glory, with its golden statues rebuilt and the inner temple walls remade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
War_for_the_Andes_title;Begin the War for the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
War_for_the_Andes_desc;When the Granadans and Caladerans wreaked havoc in Cusco, we became indebted to those who were slain to avenge them and punish the invaders. Now that our other affairs are squared away, the imperial armies are finally ready to enact our vengeance! The time has come to destroy the illegitimate Caladeran state and liberate Chinchaysuyu. Let us annihilate the northern barbarians once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
War_for_the_Andes_2_title;Begin the War for the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
War_for_the_Andes_2_desc;Washkar remembers the day that the Granadans and the Caladerans sacked Cusco well. He sees it in his nightmares, hears the sounds of the chaos whenever he is alone for too long. There is only one way to quiet the ghosts of the past : destroy Caladero! For generations, the northern savages have oppressed our imperial brethren in Chinchaysuyu. The Realm of the Four Parts must become whole once again, and that means annihilating the illegitimate state of Caladero. Let us go north and punish the barbarians in the name of Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
War_for_the_Andes_annex_QUI_title;Proclaim Victory in the North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
War_for_the_Andes_annex_QUI_desc;At last, Chinchaysuyu has been liberated! All of the major cities of Caladero now lay under our control. As Tawantinsuyu does not and has never recognized Caladero as a legitimate nation, we will not be making any sort of peace treaty with them. We shall instead simply proclaim our annexation of the territory, the ending of the “insurrection,” and the reunification of Chinchaysuyu. Our vengeance over the northern savages has been secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Amerigan_War_landing_title;Announce our Claims on the Southern Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
Amerigan_War_landing_desc;During the course of our war with the Inca, we have learned that there are several southern tribes which would be willing to turn against Cusco if we could offer them our protection instead. Let us formally declare our intent to protect these vulnerable people and, when the war is brought to a successful conclusion, bring them under our benevolent influence. §B(This decision will allow you to form a puppet in southwestern Ameriga if you defeat the Inca.)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Second_sack_cusco_title;Sack Cusco Once Again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
Second_sack_cusco_desc;Years ago, a group of Granadan and Caladeran rebels sacked and burned the Inca capital of Cusco. While they were defeated, the act dealt a heavy emotional blow to the Inca. Now, our armies are in position to lay waste once again to the so-called “Center of the Universe.” Its treasures will make for good plunder, and our righteous scouring of the city will sow despair amongst the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Sacking_Fort_Lothere_desc;Years ago, a group of Granadan and Caladeran barbarians brought hideous carnage to the holy city of Cusco. While they were defeated, the act dealt a heavy emotional blow to the empire. Now, our armies are in position to take revenge upon the European hordes by laying waste to Fort Lothère, the capital city of the Lotharingians, the architects of this war. Its treasures will make for good plunder, and our righteous scouring of the city will sow despair amongst the Lotharians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

annex_easter_island _desc;The people of Rapa Nui are peaceful yet also industrious, but the coming of Europeans to their lands threatens to destroy their entire civilization by introducing destabilizing political and economic influences. Furthermore, the island’s position makes it ideal for a naval outpost and coaling station to secure our maritime western “flank.” Let us bring these remarkable people under our benevolent protection and shield them from the European savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

annex_easter_island_desc;The savages of Easter Island are tranquil, yet strangely gifted for heathens. European traders tell of vast stone idols constructed by a people with primitive tools in the middle of the Pacific! However, we have also received word that the vile Inkans are plotting to seize the island for themselves. We must pre-empt their belligerent aggression against these vulnerable tribals, and bring them under the holy protection of the light of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

industrialization_chile_title;The Industrialization of Collasuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
industrialization_chile_desc;Our geologists and engineers have identified Collasuyu as ideally suited for industrial expansion. It possesses several valuable ores, as well as materials suited for the manufacture of gunpowder. If we were to focus the mitma system on bringing labor to the region, as well as financial assistance for the creation of new towns and the construction of factories, then it should not be difficult to build Collasuyu into a new manufacturing hub of Tawantinsuyu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
mechanizing_potosi_title;Mechanize the Mines of Potosi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
mechanizing_potosi_desc;For centuries, the Potosi mines have provided our empire with more silver than we could ever dream of. Its bountiful veins have furnished ayullus and royal artisans for generations, and Inca silver is regarded even abroad as a safe and dependable currency. However, our extraction process in the region is still reliant upon manual labor and other techniques which are now outdated. New advances in mining and transportation technology, both those imported from Qingqiu and Burgundy and those created by our own scientists, could vastly expand mining in Potosi. By focusing the mitma system on bringing new miners and building local communities in Potosi, we shall ensure that we have the labor required for such an endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
secret_police_INC_title;Establish the Black Chasquis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
secret_police_INC_desc;The threats to the Empire are numerous and we need ears and agents everywhere. Chaskis are our trusted messengers bringing our orders around the Empire throughout the treacherous roads of the Andes. We will educate them to serve as a new authority capable of suppressing dissidents, even amongst our chosen officials who would dare threaten the Empire. Soon, the sound of their pututu and the accompanying sight of their black mantle will bring fear in the hearts of the seditious - for if they don't repent, they will be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
imperial_identity_title;Promote an Imperial Identity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
imperial_identity_desc;For centuries, Tawantinsuyu has encompassed a dizzying array of peoples and languages. In this modern era of centralized nation-states, however, it is necessary to bind the empire together in a more decisive manner. The amautas (scholars) of the royal court have now proposed that we coordinate the national education program, and cultural institutions, towards the establishment of a new identity. This so-called “imperial identity” will go beyond that of tribes and peoples, focused instead upon the empire itself. Let our people be divided no longer – now and forever, we shall be one nation, one family of the sons and daughters of Inti! Even if certain extreme measures may be needed in order to do it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_granada_title;Expand Chinchaysuyu Northwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_granada_desc;Centuries ago, Tawantinsuyu extended much further north than it currently does, all the way into the central area of what the Spanish barbarians dubbed “New Granada.” These lands were once populated by robust peoples such as the Musica, and though the Spanish may have devoured their nations, their descendants remain in rural communities. Furthermore, many Granadans are themselves descended from these peoples, however much their white rulers may pretend otherwise. There are also large communities of enslaved and oppressed Africans across Granada, an unacceptably savage practice so beloved by the European brutes. Our government has thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the liberation of the “mestizos'' and the Afro-Latinos of the north is our sacred mission, our destiny! Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into Chinchaysuyu for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_title;Expand Antisuyu Eastwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
claiming_the_amazon_desc;As we consolidate our righteous leadership of the native peoples of Ameriga – under the benevolent protection of Tawantinsuyu and the rule of its Sapa Inca, of course – we look to the mighty eastern river, the Amassona, and its peoples. It is well known that the white Amerigans, especially the scheming savages of Amazonie and Atlantia, see the peoples of the east as chaff to cast out. We know better! These people, primitive though they may be, are still superior to any European. We are the defenders of the natives of Ameriga and thus it is imperative that we take control of the entire region – the whole Amassona basin! – to prevent what monstrous iniquities Europe inflicted upon northern and eastern Ameriga from playing out once again. Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into Antisuyu for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_afro_INC_title;Integrate the Afro-Latinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_afro_INC_desc;When the vile Spanish beasts invaded the continent, they did not come alone. After their barbaric and brutal slavery worked the honorable indigenous peoples of the north to death, spreading slaughter and disease across the region, they needed new chattel for their blood-soaked empire. They found it in Africa, and for centuries the sons and daughters of the Dark Continent greased the wheels of the Spanish Empire with their gore and viscera. But a new day is dawning in Ameriga, one where the so-called “colored” peoples – under the glorious leadership of Tawantinsuyu – are marching against white supremacy. There is no better way to enshrine this, then, than raising up the Afro-Latino peoples of our newly liberated lands to official status and placing them in positions of leadership over the Hispanic settlers which once degraded and tyrannized them. Surely the whites will appreciate the irony, and the blacks will become loyal subjects of our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This Empire has been built by the labors of all its peoples, great and small.” – Emperor Ernesto Castro /n /n Castro’s ambitions have paid off at last. He has led Colombia to greatness, securing its imperial status on an undisputed level. With massive public support, now is the time to complete the plan which Castro has been following since he first took office. Not as a president, for such a title is far too ordinary for his tastes. No, if he is to be the master of a nation so grand as Colombia, then he can only be an Emperor! Long live Ernesto the First, of the House de Castro, Emperor of Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colombian_republic_veracruz;Ratify the Colombian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colombian_republic_veracruz;Despite the intrigues of Peixoto and de Marquez, even they could not outfox Vicente, the Father of the Nation. Vicente is nothing if not patient, and he only accepted their attempts to dismember Colombia because he knew that they would fail. With Colombian power at an all-time high, the time has come to not merely undo the damage of the Plan of Veracruz, but to finally bring an end to Colombia’s legal void. A new constitutional conference will be called, where Lusitania and San Salvador’s autonomies will be abrogated, and where Vicente will finally achieve the liberal democracy of his dreams. At last, he will prove to Peixoto and de Marquez that their fears were unfounded, that he has always had the interests of their peoples at heart just as much as those of Mexico, and that they are all Colombians. Viva Colombia, viva democracia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
salvadoran_mexico_santander_title;Reunite Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
salvadoran_mexico_santander_desc;Now that Santander has secured the core of Mexico, the outlying fringes which were occupied by the traitorous caudillo Puente de Marquez and his loathsome San Salvadoran breakaway regime must be liberated. The time is not yet right to reabsorb all of San Salvador – that comes later – but if Santander is to have a secure power base for him to make his next moves, then he must roll back the Salvadorans and bring all of Mexico proper under his control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lustanian_mexican_war_title;Lusitania Delenda Est!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lustanian_mexican_war_desc;Santander is no friend to natives, or Freemasons, or Frenchmen, or Protestants, or…well, he despises many types of people, but he reserves a special kind of hatred for Lusitanians. Vicente might have been the orchestrator of the conspiracy which destroyed Colombia, but Santander is certain that it was aided at every juncture by Lusitanians. The region has always been a nest of separatists, traitors, and other scum, and worst of all, their disgusting, bastard dialect pollutes every word which they speak or write, filling pure Mexican eyes and ears with its hideous distortions! This will be more than a war to reconquer Lusitania, it will be the first part of a war to DESTROY Lusitania, in every sense of the word, like Carthage of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_destruction_of_lusitania_title;The Immolation of Lusitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_destruction_of_lusitania_desc;At last, the full breadth of Santander’s plan to end Lusitania is coming to fruition. He has summoned not only his generals and national gendarmerie officers, but linguists, sociologists, jurists, and educational experts. There they have drafted a plan to systematically eradicate Lusitania not only as a nationality, but as a culture, a language, and an idea. Lusitanian artists, intellectuals, and teachers will ‘disappear’ in midnight raids across the region. Lusitanian art and literature will be collected and burned. History books will be rewritten to deny that there was ever any sort of separate Lusitanian identity. Lusitanian styles of clothing, dance, song, and even cooking will be outlawed in a series of codes cleverly worded to simultaneously deny that separate forms of Lusitanian culture exist. Finally, the Lusitanian dialect will be totally outlawed. If anybody seeks to conduct any government business, if any student of any age wishes to pass their examinations, if any merchant or customer wants to buy or sell anything, then they will use Mexican Spanish and Mexican Spanish only. From this moment onwards, Lusitania has ceased to exist, and it has never existed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Salvadoran_mexico_normal_title;Reclaim Southern Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Salvadoran_mexico_normal_desc;While Colombian restorationism has been consigned to history, certain northern territories of San Salvador contain significant amounts of Mexican land. So far, the Salvadoran government has not seen things our way, insisting that any attempt to challenge their territorial integrity is a resurrection of the Santanderana. Lies! These territories are rightfully Mexican, seized by Puente de Marquez as a frontier against the mad Santander. They were Mexican lands for hundreds of years, dating back to the original Spanish colonization. Now that Santander is gone, San Salvador has no reason to hold these lands any longer. We will relieve the Salvadorans of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guatamala_to_mexico_title;Reclaim Guatemala;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guatamala_to_mexico_desc;Now that the main core of Mexico has been reunited, we must continue our campaign of liberation and restore Guatemala. Guatemala was part of Mexico for centuries before independence, yet the Salvadorans still insist that we have no claim to it. Preposterous! Everyone knows that a Guatemalan is merely a type of Mexican, and that those lands were part of de Marquez’s anti-Santander frontier. If the Salvadorans will not cooperate and restore our rightful lands, then we must use force.;;;;;;;;
mexican_baja_title;Reclaim California;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_baja_desc;When Lusitanian caudillo Deodoro Peixoto withdrew from Colombia to save his people from the Santanderana, he did not confine himself to liberating only Lusitanian lands. He also took with him the northwestern Mexican province of California, which the Lusitanian government has since insisted is a natural part of Lusitania. This is a blatant falsehood! California has been part of Mexico since the Spanish first explored the region centuries ago. That Lusitania continues to occupy it is a violation of Mexican territorial sovereignty. We must and shall liberate our Californian brethren!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_lst_federation_title;Lusitanian Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_lst_federation_desc;With Mexico reaching an unprecedented level of power and influence, the time has come to seriously consider the prospects of integrating Lusitania into our nation. True, the matter is a delicate emotional subject in both of our nations, having been one of the main goals of the hated Santander. But, as much as we might despise the man himself, it cannot be denied that our nations have many cultural and linguistic similarities. Furthermore, we were separated not by popular decision, but by the will of a single opportunistic caudillo, the Lusitanian Deodoro Peixoto. Surely the will of one strongman is nothing compared to the centuries of history which have bound our two lands together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_consitutional_reform_title;The Indigenous Peoples Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_consitutional_reform_desc;One of the most sinister aspects of the Santanderana was how he sought to exterminate the native populations. Santander frequently accused natives in his propaganda of colluding with foreign powers, spreading crime and disease, and generally being enemies of society, all to justify his campaigns of oppression against them. If he had prevailed, native communities across Mexico could have been wiped out. Ever since the Santanderana’s end, a small but devoted group of radicals have championed indigenous rights, arguing that the native peoples of Mexico have just as much a right to their own cultures, languages, and communities as everyone else. A suggestion has now been put forward to officially protect some of the largest indigenous communities, ending assimilation attempts towards them and permitting them to use their native tongues in official capacities. Not only will this establish Mexico as a beacon of progressive thinking, it will likely deal a tremendous blow to any attempts to rouse separatist sentiments among the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_language_enforcement_title;The Mexican Language Standardization Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_language_enforcement_desc;The wise Santander understood that language is the foundation of the modern nation-state : control the words of the people and you control their society. It was for this reason that he supported the supremacy of Mexican Spanish across the country, to destroy separatism and secure national unity. The indigenous populations have maintained their own savage tongues for far too long and have refused to adopt the civilized language of real Mexicans. Therefore, we shall emulate Santander’s example and enforce strict standards of Mexican Spanish upon all native communities. Henceforth Mexican Spanish shall be the law of the land, and all deviation punished. Within a generation, they will sound no different than any resident of Mexico City. Of course, this process will be greatly expedited by having the national gendarmerie “disappear” all of the scholars and teachers of these backward indigenous tongues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NCLM1.T;The Colombian Alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM1.D;For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms.” The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. §RWe are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return.§ Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

King Pedro III fought back, with the Dual Monarchy’s help, in the Peninsular War, prevailing in 1815. Pedro then restored absolutism in Spain, promulgating the Petrine Reforms to consolidate the colonial administration. For some reason, this did not satisfy the insolent criollos, who declared a revolutionary Mexican Republic in 1817! While we crushed it, we were not thorough enough. Now, Spanish Arcadia has taken up arms against the Crown under the banner of the Colombian Alliance. Only New Granada and Cuba remain secure. Currently, we are observing an armed truce with the Alliance. Some believe that we should finish the fight and annihilate the rebels, while more cautious ministers argue that it would be more sensible to consolidate our position in New Granada. §RTo resume the war would be to bet the fate of Spain upon victory…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM4.T;Bombing of the Caracas Armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM4.D;As we continue our struggle against the Colombian Alliance, we must also deal with the rebels within our own midst. A fortnight ago, the Caracas Armory exploded in the middle of the night. Many soldiers and civilians were injured and some were killed. As the Army investigates the situation, a disturbing theory has emerged that the explosion was not simply Colombian sabotage but may have been set off to cover up a robbery of the armory’s munitions. If this theory is true, then the prime suspect would be Antonio Rocafuerte, one of the rare radicals in the loyalist-dominated region of New Castille within New Granada. The llanero (cowboy) warlord Rocafuerte is the right-hand man of Guillermo de Blanco, a rogue warlord and disciple of infamous revolutionary José de Herrera. De Blanco has been at large for years, roaming through the countryside with a hardcore band of followers. If Rocafuerte’s feared Legion of Hell can strike in a place as secure as Caracas, then nowhere in New Granada may be safe from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM4.A;It was probably just some freak accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM5.T;The Maracaibo Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM5.D;A disturbing incident occurred recently in the city of Maracaibo, located on the northern New Granadan coast. A party of men dressed in Spanish Army uniforms entered the town and requested access to the armory. However, the improbably clean and unblemished state of their uniforms and their officers’ distinctive lack of any peninsular accents tipped off the guards that something was amiss. Upon being challenged, the “soldiers” were revealed to be revolutionaries in disguise! Forcing their way into the armory, they then launched a revolt aided by liberal residents of Maracaibo and seized control of the city in the names of Rocafuerte and de Blanco. The revolt lasted for several days before loyalist reinforcements arrived. Spanish troops fought street-by-street all the way to the rebel’s holdout in the armory, significantly damaging the city in the process. While the revolt has now been crushed, the incident has stoked the flames of independence throughout New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM6.T;An Armistice to End All Colombian Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM6.D;The War of Colombian Independence has devastated the New World and wreaked havoc upon Spain’s economy and political stability, not to mention the cost in human lives. So much blood has been shed, in fact, that Spain has been driven to accept the loss of the northern half of their New World colonial empire. In a diplomatic ceremony in Lisbon, Spain has recognized the independence of the Colombian Alliance. Joyous cries of celebration ring out from Lusitania to Andagoya, but the mood in Spain is one of fear, anxiety, and doubt towards an uncertain future. New Spain has decisively slipped from its old master’s hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM6.A;All who have served the Crown have plowed the sea…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM7.T;Disaster on the Horizon;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM7.D;With our soldiers still not yet in reach of the Colombian traitors’ bastion of Mexico City, the notorious Guillermo de Blanco is preparing to return to conventional warfare. Emboldened by the continued failure of the Spanish Army to subdue the Colombian Alliance, de Blanco has been rapidly rebuilding support among local New Granadan elites and military officers for an armed uprising. It is believed that de Blanco seeks to incite a revolution of his own in New Granada, positioning himself as de Herrera’s successor. If he were to launch such a revolt, the effort required to squash it would require all but abandoning the field of battle to the Colombians. §RIt may be wise to accept the loss of New Spain and focus on preventing the loss of New Granada as well.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM7.A;We cannot afford to lose both halves of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM7.B;Spain will not bow before some bandit with delusions of grandeur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM8.T;Spanish Retreat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM8.D;Guillermo de Blanco’s efforts to incite revolution in New Granada have forced the peninsular Spaniards to finally admit that we are beyond their grasp. They have abandoned all attempts to subjugate us, withdrawing their forces south to prepare for whatever calamity lies in wait for them in New Granada. While we can only express our hope that de Blanco’s endeavors are successful, for now let us rejoice that the bloodshed and struggle of the past has ended in our victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM8.A;Viva Colombia, viva Libertad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM9.T;The Alliance Secured;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM9.D;Throughout its existence, the Colombian Alliance has been in a twilight zone of half-nationhood. A massive conglomeration of regions, cultures, and languages, many feared that the Alliance would disintegrate as soon as the war with Spain was won. It seems, however, that these fears were misplaced, or at least exaggerated. Colombia has persevered as a unified entity, albeit as a highly decentralized confederation. The goal now is to untangle the government and find a stable, durable form of administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM9.A;At last, the true work begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM910.T;The Fall of Bogotà;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM910.D;Guillermo de Blanco has finally made his move. Boosting the ranks of his veteran guerilla army with opportunistic elites, traitorous army personnel, and disgruntled peasantry, de Blanco has emerged from hiding and has launched a series of attacks on New Granadan cities! First Bogota, then Cartagena have fallen before his insurrectionary army. Due to the sparse nature of the New Granadan garrisons with the routing of all available troops to the Colombian front, few outposts are well-staffed enough to oppose him. Worse, many communities are starting to voluntarily align with the increasingly popular revolutionary…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM910.A;The ghost of de Herrera looms large over New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM10.T;The Herrerian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM10.D;The full scope of de Blanco’s ambition has been revealed. In a proclamation in Bogota, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and though he might be a traitorous madman, he has added many souls to his already sizable guerilla army. As village after village, city after city, province after province rises up in support of him, northern Ameriga once more plunges into the inferno. This may be the beginning of yet another bitter struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM10.A;May de Blanco follow his predecessor to Hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM11.T;The Return of Ballivián;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM11.D;When revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Caladero and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. De Herrara perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness. Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Tupac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. However, with de Blanco once again waging war against Spain, another one of de Herrera’s old compatriots has returned from hiding. An army of Balliviánists, supplied by de Blanco, has stormed into Caladero, with Ballivián himself arriving in Quito on a whaling ship. Ballivián’s rapid advance caught nearly all Caladerans off guard, and he has been proclaimed President of Caladero as both the Realists and the Romanticists head back into the political underground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM11.A;Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM110.T;The 5th of March Demonstrations;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM110.D;Spain’s position in the New World continues to be thrown into doubt. After the Crown announced its recognition of the independence of the Colombian Confederation, and the dissolution of the Golden Board of Atlantia, the Romanticists escalated their liberal rhetoric. This has culminated in a series of protests in Quito to object to Spain’s onerous rule. They focused on three points : first, that it was Caladerans, not Spaniards, who won the day against Washkar Inca, second, that Spain had never acknowledged or healed Caladero’s damage during the War of 1826, and third, that a Crown-appointed caudillo and emphasis on Lisbon’s role in administration is an obsolete system in need of reform. The decision to hold the protests on the 5th of March was especially provocative : the First Mexican Republic was proclaimed on that day in Mexico City in 1817. The Duke of Tupac has made vague assurances of reforms but the event has further inflamed political tensions in Caladero and may have caught Spanish attention as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM110.A;As if we needed more trouble…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM12.T;Responding to the 5th of March Demonstrations;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.D;Political turmoil has wracked Caladero, our errant viceroyalty in western Ameriga. Its current Viceroy, the Duke of Tupac, was given the job in recognition of his role in assembling the Army of the Volunteers, a ragtag force of Chimu, Quechua, mestizo, and Spanish forces, to oppose Washkar Inca, who rampaged through Caladero all the way to Chan Chan in retaliation for revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco raiding the Incan capital of Cusco. Tupac has proven a mercurial caudillo, one with dubious political ideas who continues to push the limits of acceptable conduct for a viceroy. Recently, protests have erupted against our rule in Caladero, and Viceroy Tupac has been alarmingly slow to retaliate against them. Furthermore, Spanish officers in Caladero have reported suspicious activity between known Caladeran radicals and individuals believed to be affiliated with de Blanco. This clearly requires action, but what sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM12.A;Reprimand Tupac, he must remember his place and his oath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM12.B;Demand that Tupac arrest all radicals within the colony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.D;The Duke of Tupac has defied us! The viceroy has refused to support a crackdown within Caladero, claiming that such a move would endanger the colony’s stability. This unprecedented defiance from a viceroy has shocked the royal court, and our ministers are now urging the King to remove Tupac and his administration from office – by force if necessary. The major risk in doing so is twofold : first, it would require redirecting resources which are currently being used to surveil and suppress radical agents in New Granada, and second, it might provoke the Duke to take extreme measures to defend himself. Yet if we do nothing, these problems shall continue to worsen and the clandestine flow of aid to New Granadan radicals may grow, not to mention the international loss of face. How shall we address the situation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM13.A;Send a sharper reprimand to the Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM13.B;Order the Land Army to remove the Viceroy by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM14.T;The Caladeran Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM14.D;When news reached the Duke of Tupac that the Spanish Land Army was mustering to oust him by order of the Crown, he decided that desperate times called for desperate measures. At a hastily convened meeting of Caladeran political leaders, including Chimu and Quechuan lords, the Duke declared the independence of the Republic of Caladero! Tupac cited the continued tyranny of the Spanish government, specifically the reviled Petrine Reforms, as his motivation, and promised to form a wide coalition to defend against Spain. With both Spain and Caladero gearing up for the struggle to come, certain things have fallen by the wayside – such as the targeting of de Blanco’s supply lines, which have quietly resurged now that Tupac and the Crown have directed their attention elsewhere and the Spanish position in Caladero has been abruptly terminated. As Caladero prepares to fight, another revolutionary may soon take to the field in New Granada, but as far as Tupac is concerned…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM14.A;”It’s just me against the world.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM15.T;The Raid on the Caracas Armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM15.D;We thought that the end of the struggle with Colombia would inaugurate a new era of stability in the rest of our empire, but this seems to have been too optimistic. This morning, word reached the royal court that the Spanish Army’s Caracas armory was looted by the guerilla forces of notorious revolutionary Guillermo de Blanco! Apparently, Antonio Rocafuerte, a llanero (cowboy) warlord who is de Blanco’s right-hand man and a native of New Castille, used a little-known mountain path to bypass the local patrols, then assaulted the town shortly after midnight. His feared Legion of Hell overpowered the initial defenses and headed straight for the armory, blowing open the doors and grabbing all the arms and ammunition that they could carry. As they absconded back into the wilderness, they shouted horrid curses towards the Spanish crown, and cried, “Viva de Blanco!” De Blanco’s traitors are now quite well-armed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM15.A;Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM16.T;Raids in Cartagena Countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM16.D;De Blanco wasted no time in putting his ill-gotten gains to use. He has returned to a more confrontational posture, launching coordinated assaults upon loyalist communities throughout the greater Cartagena region. Guerillas have attacked villages across the area, pilfering everything from crops and livestock to tools and medicine. Any town which does not sufficiently “support” de Blanco’s cause is a potential target. All the while, Rocafuerte works in the shadows of New Castille to undermine the Spanish government with more subtle means – we certainly can’t spare the resources to hunt him down at this point. As the guerillas wage their most ambitious campaign of violence yet, de Blanco is slowly but surely approaching Bogota, local administrative center of New Granada. If Bogota falls, the whole Spanish colonial government may be imperiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM16.A;Bogota must not fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM17.T;The Bogota Uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM17.D;With much of New Granada affected by de Blanco’s attacks, the defenders of Bogota were determined not to make the mistakes of others. The city’s armory and granaries were put under heavy guard, local Indians were enlisted to identify little-known paths, and rural militias were made ready to repel invaders. There was only one matter which eluded our notice : the loyalty of the Bogotan garrison itself. With the burden of the Colombian war and de Blanco’s campaign of terror drawing so much attention, the condition – particularly the salaries – of local soldiers became rather degraded. Several of de Blanco’s sympathizers, some of them women, were able to infiltrate the city and contact the garrison, promising them great rewards if they defected. Soon enough, the garrison mutinied, and opened the gates of the city to de Blanco’s army. Bogota, one of the most important cities in New Granada, is now in de Blanco’s hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM17.A;Is there no end to the New World’s legions of traitors!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM18.T;The Herrerian Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM18.D;With the acquisition of Bogota, de Blanco is now prepared to fully contest Spanish rule of New Granada. In a speech delivered from the former viceroy’s mansion, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and with much of New Granada now aligned towards him, he might just be able to back up his claims. Rocafuerte’s intrigues have been unable to topple New Castille in time, but if de Blanco is successful then he too shall surely triumph. As northern Ameriga plunges back into the inferno, we must once again prepare for a bitter struggle in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM18.A;Revolution is a malaise of Arcadian and Amerigan minds…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM19.T;Ballivián’s Insurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM19.D;When revolutionaries José de Herrera, Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Caladero and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. De Herrara perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness. Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Tupac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. Now, however, de Blanco has launched a new revolution against Spain, and has aided his old compatriot Ballivián in making a bid for Caladero! Traitorous army units are already mutinying in favor of the guerilla leader, but there still remain enough loyal forces that Ballivián might be able to be thwarted with a swift enough response, unless the revolt gains too much momentum…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM19.A;The mutiny spreads and sweeps Ballivián into the presidency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM19.B;The mutiny is crushed, and Ballivián flees into exile once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM119.T;The Second Army of the Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM119.D;While Ballivián was able to secure generals’ loyalty with vast concessions, the common people had not forgotten his role in the ransacking of Caladero. Native, mestizo, and Spanish communities all burned with rage at the thought of the man who laid waste to their homes now ruling them. In the face of Ballivián’s dictatorship, the Romanticists used their secret societies to rally anti-Ballivián sentiment across Caladero, and the Realists agreed to an emergency alliance to save the nation. This led to the formation of a multi-ethnic Second Army of the Volunteers, inspired by the ad hoc force which defeated Washkar Inca. Yesterday, they launched revolts throughout the Quito countryside before converging upon the city. Ballivián sallied forth with his loyalists, but the Volunteers shattered the dictator’s army and seized Ballivián, trying, convicting, and executing him for treason. A new government has been formed, and with the Realists sidelined, the Romanticists have taken the lead in bringing revolutionary democracy to Caladero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM119.A; May the Revolution burn eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM20.T;Herreria Calls for Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.D;Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish. As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM20.A;Herreria calls, and Colombia will answer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM20.B;Let de Blanco fight his own battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.T;The Herrerian Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.D;De Blanco’s revolution has spread like a cancer throughout New Granada. While Rocafuerte has so far failed to incite revolt in the eastern region of New Castille, enough local western elites have been swayed to de Blanco’s cause that he effectively controls half of the colony. He has proven totally unwilling to negotiate, demanding nothing less than unconditional and immediate independence. This cannot be permitted! Spain must not be driven from the New World! We shall fight to the bitter end to preserve our power and fight back against the tide of radicalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM21.A;Viva el Rey, viva España!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM22.T;Herreria Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM22.D;The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Spanish forces have been beaten at every turn and forced out of Herreria, and Rocafuerte has finally driven New Castille into joining de Blanco’s revolution. The failure in New Granada has led to the total collapse of the Spanish war effort throughout the New World, as the morale of the military crashes and Spain is forced to retreat to the Caribbean.  Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM22.A;Dios mío, Dios mío, ¿por qué me has abandonado?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM23.T;The Treaty of Lisbon;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM23.D;The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Though Spain struggled mightily, Spanish forces have suffered a series of particularly disastrous defeats which have totally shattered its armies and sent morale into an unrecoverable dive, as the New Castillians finally abandon Spain and throw their support behind Rocafuerte’s own revolution. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM23.A;Dios mío, Dios mío, ¿por qué me has abandonado?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM24.T;Peace in New Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM24.D;Spain and Herreria have fought one another to exhaustion, with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. While Spain was ready to recognize Herreria’s independence in exchange for keeping control of New Castille, it seems that fate had other plans. Towards the close of the conflict, Rocafuerte finally amassed enough support for a revolution of his own. With many elites disillusioned by Spain’s failure to defeat de Blanco, Rocafuerte rode the tide of unrest all the way into the presidency of the revolutionary Republic of Cumaná. The failure of the New Granadan front has caused the entire Spanish war effort throughout the New World to disintegrate. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM24.A;Dios mío, Dios mío, ¿por qué me has abandonado?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
NCLM25.T;Granada Reconquered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM25.D;For all of de Blanco’s bluster and bravado, he proved to be a far less able military leader than a guerilla commander. Spanish troops, operating out of supply bases in the loyal region of New Castille, crushed the Herrerian rebels in a series of decisive battles, and secured all the major cities in western New Granada. Seeing Herreria’s failure, the Colombians have sued for peace, and we have regained control of New Granada at the expense of surrendering our claim to New Spain. De Blanco has been put on a clipper ship back to Spain for trial for treason, and Rocafuerte has fled into exile in Colombia. With New Granada back under rightful Spanish rule, the perseverance of our empire in the New World in at least some form has been assured. The stain of Colombia’s independence, however, will be difficult to erase from our political consciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM25.A;At least we may celebrate this victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.T;The Nueva Reconquista Completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.D;Alleluia! Once more the Spanish banner flies over the heart of the New World, from Lusitania to Essequibo. The traitors lie vanquished before us, their armies annihilated, and the rebel cities pacified. Anastasio Vicente died fighting during the siege of Mexico City, while notorious New Granadan warlord Guillermo de Blanco and his first lieutenant Antonio Rocafuerte were apprehended in Cartagena while preparing to board an express ship to Etruria, disguised as Catholic monks. Both have been placed under armed guard and sent back to Spain to face trial for treason, and, after conviction, a speedy execution is expected to follow. The Pope himself has praised our victory as a sign of God’s favor and the triumph of the Catholic faith and its holy monarchs over the wickedness of radicalism. As the Spanish Empire experiences a glorious rebirth, nations around the world are reevaluating their plans to account for a Spain which has retaken its place as a true Great Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM26.A;God willed it, and in His sign we have conquered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.T;Collapse of the Colombian and Herrerian Revolutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.D;The flame of independence in the Spanish New World has been extinguished, stamped out by the boots of the Spanish Land Army. As the rebellious lands are reorganized back into viceroyalties and the old colonial hierarchy reasserts itself, we find our position precarious indeed. Caladero has become a byword for treachery among the Spanish royal court, and we must decide as to how we shall approach the Spanish Empire now that it has won its blood-soaked triumph. Shall we submit to the inevitable and render up ourselves to the Crown, confirming our vassalage? Or shall we make a final stand for freedom and liberty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM27.A;All we can do is tend our gardens beneath the Spanish flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.B;We must dare to dream the impossible dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.T;The Caladeran War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.D;After New Granada was restabilized, an envoy was dispatched to Caladero to formally confirm their place within the Spanish Empire and make a general assessment of the local conditions. Unexpectedly, the envoy was violently ejected from Caladero, which has declared itself an independent republic! It seems that de Herrera’s spirit of liberty has returned to haunt the Spanish New World for one final time. The last battle for the Spanish Empire begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM28.A;Deus vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.T;The Second Colombian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.D;”When this country was emancipated, it sought equality, justice, and reason. Yet the representatives that were elected did not represent the people, and the leaders that were chosen have not led us to success. The aim of this proclamation is to make clear the necessity of restoring honor to the nation…” – General Agustín de Santander /n /n The failure of the Colombian government to support the Herrerian Revolution and the collapse of the radical cause in New Granada has spurred dissent against the Vicente regime. A conservative general named Agustín de Santander took advantage of Vicente being confined to his bed with a fever, and led a military contingent into Mexico City, declaring himself the new President of Colombia. With the opposition paralyzed, it seems that Santander’s reign has already begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM29.A;Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.T;The Fate of Vicente;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.D;President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain. Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.A;An assassin, who guns him down and flees out the window!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM30.B;His faithful black cat, Santa Anna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.T;The Death of Vicente;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.D;Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds. Two sides have emerged : the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM31.A;God help us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.T;The Plan of Tlalpan;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.D;Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lusitanian General Deodoro Peixoto managed to secure control of the Mexico City countryside. Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in the town of Tlalpan and proclaimed the Plan of Tlalpan. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way. With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM32.A;Perhaps we were not meant to be one nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.T;The Oaxaca Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM33.D;Tensions in Colombia exploded in the aftermath of President Vicente’s assassination. No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation. President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution. What shall be the fate of Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM34.T;The Plan of Veracruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM34.D;Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lieutenant Colonel Castro took control of the vital port city of Veracruz while order in the rest of the country began to collapse. A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it. Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President.;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM34.A;Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.T;Castro’s Inaugural Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.D;After Castro was sworn into office, he gave a speech to the assembled crowd, outlining his goals and intentions going forward. “Colombia is destined to be a colossus of the New World,” he declared, “but only if we give her the sword and the shield which she needs.” Castro went on to explain that this meant a strong, centralized government, an orderly political sphere, and a bold foreign policy “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” He confidently predicted that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.” Castro wound up his remarks by stating that he was “prepared to bring a new, visionary strength to the Colombian executive, the likes of which few have seen before, or even dreamt of.” Centralists and expansionists were thrilled by his rhetoric, but many others--especially rural elites--were concerned by his implications. §RIf Castro does not make Colombia a world power, then there may be consequences.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM35.A;May he steward Colombia well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.T;The Cuban Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.D;As Castro continues to reshape domestic politics, he has taken an interest in foreign affairs as well. Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.” The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. §RIf Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences. §;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM36.A;Cuba was, is, and will be Colombian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.T;The Plan of Colima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.D;”I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro /n /n In the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM37.A;Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.T;The Plan of Colima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.D;Castro’s overthrow by a liberal revolution was supposed to usher in a new era of enlightened, scientific governance. Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality. Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting the liberals down and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM38.A;Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.T;Emperor Ernesto Assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.D;Emperor Ernesto created a strong, centralized government, a powerful nation free from caudillismo : for him to take up a crown in the aftermath was only natural. Some, however, disagreed, despising Ernesto for violating their notions of Colombian republicanism. Now these traitors have committed the vilest crime. As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital. The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM39.A;The end of an era, or merely the start of one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.T;The Golden Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.D;The assassination of Emperor Ernesto may not have incited a civil war, but the political situation is nevertheless perilous. Many republicans resigned themselves to quieter means of political struggle while Ernesto the First was alive, but news of his death threatened to give his enemies the chance to tear down the institutions which he built. The landlords and caudillos certainly had no special attraction to the man they saw as the reason for their decline. Thus, to prevent the republicans from deposing the regency, the monarchists have been forced to make massive concessions to their political rivals for the sake of national unity. The “Golden Constitution,” as liberals have called it, extends tremendous political rights, including universal suffrage and a free press, while also federalizing the government. Ernesto the First would be turning in his grave if he knew what the regency council has done but at least the empire which he built will survive him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM40.A;Respect for the rights of others means peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.D;President Vicente has announced his boldest plan yet : the creation of a Colombian constitution to transform the nation into a united, democratic, parliamentary republic. The document lays out protections for the rights of the people, and clarifies the roles, powers, and responsibilities of the national government. While Vicente has taken care to delineate the boundaries of federal authority and reserve numerous rights and duties to the provinces, the document has already drawn strong criticism from provincial caudillos as a dictum handed down from above rather than the result of popular debate. The president is counting on his status as a national hero, and the courting of liberal sentiments, to ensure the constitution’s ratification, and drafts are already being delivered to the Colombian state governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM41.A;Is democracy within reach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.T;The Morelia Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.D;The new constitution has been met with concern and suspicion by many Colombian caudillos. Many of them have now gathered in Morelia, where they have drafted a document to explain their objections to Vicente and his supporters. The manifesto claims that the constitution as written concentrates an unacceptable amount of power into the hands of the federal government, opening the door for any of Vicente’s successors to use it to strangle the provinces. Moreover, they have criticized the process of the constitution’s promulgation, objecting to having been left out of the creative process. While the manifesto reaffirms the caudillos’ loyalty to Colombia and its president, denouncing anyone who attempts to use their criticism as grounds for secession, the manifesto’s conclusion declares that “All who sign this document in doing so declare their intent to withhold their signature from the new constitution in its present form.” Most of Colombia’s caudillos have signed it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM42.A;This will not do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.T;Vicente Calls the Veracruz Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.D;While a more brash type might have attempted to ram the constitution down the caudillos’ throats, Vicente has not gotten to where he is by resorting to violence so easily. Recognizing that the caudillos have merely objected to the constitution’s form, not its existence, he has summoned all the major caudillos of Colombia to a conference in Veracruz to devise a revision to the current constitutional draft. By involving all caudillos in the writing process, nobody will be able to say that they were left out of the discussion. Hopes are high that the conference will bring reconciliation and avoid a crisis, but only time will tell if Vicente’s idealism will survive the caudillos’ objections. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM43.A;To Veracruz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.T;The Veracruz Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.D;Presidente Vicente and all the state caudillos of Colombia have arrived in the city of Veracruz to revise the constitution into a form acceptable by all parties. At stake is not simply the future of Colombia’s government, but the very ideas of representative democracy and liberal republicanism. Vicente is serious about defending his ideas, but he knows that even he, the “Father of the Nation,” is not invincible. §RIf Vicente and his liberal supporters reject too many of the conservatives’ proposals, then the consequences for both the constitution and the republic may be dire.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM44.A;Let’s get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.T;Education Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.D;The first matter to spark serious debate is the future of schooling in Colombia. Vicente and the liberals want a school system with funding at both the state and federal level, a national curriculum, and mandatory enrollment. Many caudillos have objected to this, seeing it as being too overreaching, and have demanded minimal federal guidelines for education and no funding mandates on states. Moderates have suggested that the Ministry of Education focus on ensuring national literacy, with the form of schooling up to individual states to decide. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.A:The liberal option of large federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.B;The compromise option of small federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM45.C;The conservative option of no federal assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.T;Immigration Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.D;The next contentious matter is that of Colombian immigration. Ever since the Alliance coalesced, the government has essentially avoided the topic, preferring to focus on consolidation and defending against Spain. With Colombia’s future as a nation seemingly confirmed, however, liberals have argued that a national, official “open door” policy should be adopted to draw new immigrants to enrich the nation. Many conservatives, however, feel that such topics are inappropriate for this conference, and the caudillos are intensely wary of language setting down immigration as something which only the federal government, not individual state governments, can control. Moderates have suggested inserting immigrantion-friendly language into the constitutional preamble, the part most likely to be read by foreigners, but without any new immigration laws. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.A:The liberal option of an official open door policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.B:The moderate option of pro-immigration imagery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM46.C:The conservative option of ignoring immigration for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.T;Native Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.D;Tremendous arguments have emerged around the issue of the native populations within Colombia. Liberals seek paths for natives to obtain full citizenship, so long as they meet certain qualifications of literacy and personal morality, and the creation of an Office of Native Affairs to assist in the assimilation of native peoples into Colombian society. Many caudillos, however, do not want native peoples to receive any special treatment beyond necessary measures to root out “antisocial behaviors and savage customs,” and furthermore believe that such matters are purely a state and local issue. Moderates have backed the creation of an Office of Native Affairs but suggest that it instead focus on establishing dedicated living areas for native peoples to inhabit in peace. The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.A:The liberal option of strong aid for native assimilation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.B;The compromise option of moderate aid for native reservations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM47.C;The conservative option of minimal aid for native integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.T;Military Service Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.D;Debate has finally reached the topic which Vicente has been dreading : the composition of the Colombian military. Ever since the end of the conflict with Spain, Vicente has believed that only a robust system of mandatory military training and service, drawing upon all levels of society, could provide Colombia with the defense it needs. Such a concept strikes at the very heart of aristocratic and stratocratic privilege which supports many provincial caudillos and is anathema to the traditionalist officer corps of the Colombian military. Moderates have proposed a minimal program of basic training for all adult Colombian males, but even this may be too much for the conservatives to stomach. At the heart of this debate is a question : do the states control their militaries, loaning them to the federal government when needed? Or does the federal government control the military, calling upon anyone who can fight and making rich and poor man alike an equally capable soldier? The conference eventually settles on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.A:The liberal option of mandatory service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.B;The moderate option of basic training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM48.C;The conservative option of the traditional military organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.T;Ratification of the Colombian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.D;After tense and extensive debate between liberals and conservatives, President Vicente and the provincial caudillos have finally arrived at a compromise and drafted a new Colombian constitution. Though highly conservative in some respects, the final document upholds Vicente’s principles of democratic, representative federalism. Furthermore, the conference has established a positive precedent for the peaceful resolution of Colombia’s political disputes via debate and collaboration, not intrigue and warfare. All eyes are now on Vicente, to see if he will be able to prove the constitution’s worth by elevating Colombia to new heights of greatness. If he cannot do so even with the document which he and his supporters worked so hard to achieve, then the luster may fade from his achievement and the wolves may once again lurk at the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM49.A;We shall not disappoint the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.T;The Treason of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.D;The Veracruz Conference, rather than find a compromise between President Vicente and his critics, instead saw the liberals attempt to force upon the conservatives a document which they had no interest in supporting. When news of this leaked out, General Agustín de Santander, a man known for his aristocratic background and his strong ties to various Colombian landlords, declared the conference illegal and attempted to arrest Vicente and his liberal supporters! While many reformists were seized by Santander’s rebels, a few managed to smuggle Vicente out of Veracruz and back to Mexico City. As the constitutional draft languishes forgotten, the future of Colombia hangs in the balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM50.A;A disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.T;A Midnight Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.D;Santander soon realized that he’d been tricked : with no sign of Vicente within Veracruz, he raced to Mexico City and will soon be at its gates. In the middle of the night, with Santander and his forces expected to arrive the next morning, Vicente is called upon by two mysterious men. After his guards search them and Vicente receives them in his office, they reveal themselves : Deodoro Peixoto and Puente de Marquez, the two most powerful caudillos in Colombia. They explain that they have come as representatives of Colombia’s caudillos, who do not trust Santander and fear that he may become a tyrant in ways which Vicente has never been. Therefore, they are willing to throw their forces to Vicente’s defense and shatter Santander’s coup attempt, but their price is steep. Peixoto and de Marquez demand nothing less than total autonomy for their states in return for their aid, and warn that if Vicente refuses, they will swallow their pride and back Santander to prevent liberal domination. What happened next is well recorded…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.A;Vicente agreed, and Santander was defeated and executed for treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM51.B;Vicente refused, and was deposed and exiled days later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM511.T;The Plan of Veracruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM511.D;With Santander defeated by the caudillos, Vicente has had to hold up his end of the bargain. He has returned to Veracruz, this time not to build a new Colombia, but perhaps to set the stage for its fall. By the terms of the newly published Plan of Veracruz, vast swathes of Colombia have become virtually sovereign except in matters of foreign affairs and defense. Although the new Colombian constitution has been promulgated within Colombia proper, it will not be applicable within the territories of Lusitania or San Salvador. Many liberals are horrified with what they see as a critical weakening of Colombia. Vicente has defended Colombian democracy, but only time will tell if it was worth the cost. §RIf Lusitania or San Salvador become entirely independent from Colombia then even Vicente may not be able to prevent total dissolution.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM511.A;The Colombian dream hangs by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.T;The End of Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.D;The Colombian dream is over. This morning, President Anastasio Vicente was found deceased in his bed, having passed away in the night. News of the President’s death has caused the remaining caudillos to lose whatever shreds of loyalty they still possessed towards the federal government in Mexico City. Given that one of the ‘autonomous territories’ had already become independent, this came as little surprise, yet it confirmed what many had known for some time already : Colombia has followed its father to the grave. Vice President Benito Villa was sworn in shortly after Vicente’s death was discovered, and his first act as president was to request that the legislature formally dissolve Colombia and institute a new nation in its place: the Mexican Republic. With both Lusitania and San Salvador now beyond our reach, we can only hope that our new nation will know greater peace than the one which we have left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM52.A;The problem with dreams is that you always wake up from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.T;The Rise of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.D;”Do the people of Colombia and those who administrate its provinces have the freedom to act, or do they not? From Vicente, we have been told that we have only the freedom to obey. Is this the greatness which we were promised? We who had the resolution to attack Spanish tyranny also have the resolution to fight Mexico City autocracy. If our leaders cannot lead us to success then we have no reason to follow them.” – General Agustín de Santander /n /n Not everybody has been satisfied with the new constitution, and Colombian reactionaries have found a standard bearer in General Agustín de Santander, a man of aristocratic origins and good friend of the landholding elite. Santander has given several acidic speeches denouncing Vicente as a despot and a man long past his prime. Some dismiss such charges as ludicrous, but his appeal may grow if Vicente cannot achieve sufficiently grand success for Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM53.A;Colombia shall brook no Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.T;The Plan of Zapopan;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.D;Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia. The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. This would be cause for alarm…yet reports seem to indicate that Santander is far less popular than many believe. If Vicente holds firm and quickly issues a response calling on the people to support him against Santander’s scheme, it might foil the whole plot. Of course, Vicente is not a young man, and there is a small but undeniable temptation in retirement... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.A;Perhaps it is time for a changing of the guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM54.B;Let Colombia answer its father’s call one final time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.T;The Plan of Zapopan;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.D;Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia. The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. With much of the Colombian military thoroughly dissatisfied with Vicente, Santander has rallied them to depose the president and inaugurate himself in Vicente’s place. As the Father of the Nation flees into exile, likely never to return, a new order dawns over Colombia, lit by the fire smouldering in Santander’s eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM55.A;Viva Santander! Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.T;The Reform War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.D;Santander must surely have been disappointed when he realized that the rest of the nation was not going to rally to his traitorous call. However, the General still commands considerable support within his home state of Jalisco, and he has leveraged this into an insurrection. Rallying what limited forces he can muster, Santander has declared his intent to march on Mexico City and depose Vicente! Very few people outside of Jalisco have any expectation that he will prevail, but General Santander is determined to make one final bid for supreme power. As the Jaliscans raise the banner of rebellion, it seems that Vicente’s fight for democracy must once more be fought on the fields of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM56.A;Death to traitors! Viva Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.T;The End of an Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.D;The defeat and execution of the traitorous General Agustín de Santander has finally given Vicente and the liberals a chance to clean out the reactionary rot that has infested Colombia for far too long. Across the nation, government officials known to be corrupt or arch-reactionaries have been forced to resign, and the elections which have been called to replace them herald the coming of a new generation. It is a generation which shall take at face value Vicente’s principles of democracy and republicanism. Vicente has seen to it that they shall inherit a better nation by promulgating yet another constitutional revision, this time one of true liberal reform, to do what he could not at Veracruz. The legislature has already signed it, and the convention which shall be called to ratify it a mere formality. For the first time since the end of the war with Spain, when Vicente feels the aching in his bones which remind him of his age, he is not troubled, for he knows that he has laid a strong foundation for future Colombians to build upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM57.A;Liberty is made difficult because it is the accomplishment and perfectness of man. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.T;Herencia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.D;Last night, President Anastasio Vicente decided to retire to bed early to prepare for campaigning to support a liberal candidate, Porfirio Juarez, in the state of Yucatan. When, next morning, the president had not arisen over an hour after usual, a servant discovered that Vicente had passed away in his sleep the previous night. Word soon spread of this, and now all of Colombia is in mourning over the man who had more than earned his title of Father of the Nation. Thousands upon thousands have traveled to Mexico City, from the wealthiest caudillos to threadbare peasants, to pay their respects to the man who sacrificed every ounce of his strength towards liberty and democracy. Vincente leaves behind not only a family of kin, but the family of Colombia, the sons and daughters who have grown up in the same national household and who now must navigate the world without their father. Their inheritance – a strong democracy, an equitable federal government, and a just constitution – is a gift which few others can claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM58.A;”Amor regge suo imperio senza spada.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.T;The Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.D;When Santander was building up his power base, many people thought that they understood him. They saw him as a friend of the elites, and an enemy of liberalism and centralism, somebody who would create a weak federal government and allow the landlords, the church, and the military to carry on as they always had with minimal fuss. These people thought wrong. Santander certainly valued such institutions, but never as ends – only as means, the means to absolute power, which he now knows is within his grasp. And now that he is in control of Colombia, he intends to use that power to remake the entire nation in his image. He will tolerate those who wish to assist him, but all those who oppose him shall be destroyed. The northerners and the southerners will complain, he knows, but they will soon comprehend the glory of his vision or face the consequences. Colombia is now under a shadow, the shadow of the Santanderana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM59.A;May God have mercy upon Colombia, for Santander shall have none.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.T;The Plot Against Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.D;Our illustrious President Agustín de Santander has keen powers of perception, far greater than most. This is how he became aware of a vast conspiracy, reaching from remote villages all the way to the halls of power, to destroy his revolution and plunge Colombia into the fires of ruin. Unfortunately, the national gendarmerie is not up to the task of rooting them out by themselves – and they may already be compromised. Therefore, Santander has published a pamphlet, titled “The Plot Against Colombia,” in which he outlines the conspiracy in broad terms and exhorts the citizens of Colombia to be vigilant and assist him in rooting out the traitors across the nation. Already, reports are coming in of hundreds, even thousands of suspicious individuals in Mexico City alone! Men and women denouncing Santander, praising traitors like Vicente, even discussing his overthrow! Lusitania and San Salvador seem to be especially rife with conspirators, and Santander has commanded his loyalists in these regions to be ready for action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM60.A;If you aren’t with me, then you’re one of THEM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.T;The San Salvador City Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.D;The anti-conspiracy campaign of President Santander has borne fruit even sooner than he had hoped! It seems that a group of loyalists in San Salvador City became aware of rumors that the Salvadoran caudillo, Puente de Marquez, was in contact with Vicentistas abroad to engineer Santander’s overthrow, and that he had been overhead denouncing the president! Outraged at a traitor in such a powerful position, these brave loyalists took it upon themselves to drive him out and deliver justice to him themselves. They attempted to storm the Salvadoran caudillo’s mansion, only halting when they came face to face with his personal guard. Rather than face justice, the cowardly de Marquez ordered his troops to open fire on the courageous patriots! Many virtuous men and women were cut down by the traitors’ legions, and Santander is more convinced than ever of the need to crack down upon these architects of intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM61.A;The martyrs gave their lives to destroy these criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.T;The Plan of Tegucigalpa;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.D;President Santander’s suspicions have been confirmed: the caudillos have assumed leadership of the conspiracy! This morning the President received notice of a traitorous manifesto published by Lusitania’s Deodoro Peixoto and San Salvador’s Puente de Marquez. This “Plan of Tegucigalpa” endorses such absurd concepts as “freedom against unlawful search and seizure,” and “accountability of the executive branch”! The document exhorts the President to call off the hunt for the conspiracy (Never!), arguing that it does not actually exist (Ridiculous!) and imploring Santander to restore the rule of law (I AM THE LAW!). Santander is unfazed – he knew that the heads of the hydra would rear one day. There is no need to negotiate with traitorous scum. The President has already dispatched gendarmes to arrest and execute the caudillos at once and has furthermore decided to eliminate all obstacles to maximum efficiency by revoking all governorships nationwide. Santander will personally appoint new governors to rule in his name and by his will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM611.A;Finally, he thinks, sanity is coming to Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.T;Twilight of Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.D;MUTINY! Everywhere Santander looks, the pillars of the nation are collapsing before his very eyes! First, he received word that the gendarmes he sent to punish the caudillos instead swore loyalty to them! Then, both men announced the independence of their respective territories from Colombia! Reports soon began to pour in from the northern and southern frontiers of soldiers native to Lusitania or San Salvador deserting their posts en masse and returning home, or even worse, swearing loyalty to Peixoto or de Marquez. As refugees begin to pour into Lusitania and San Salvador, and foreign investors flee in panic, chaos spreads across the land and it seems as though the conspiracy has succeeded. Santander grits his teeth as he surveys the damage, a map of his former nation sprawled across his desk. He already has a new plan – dangerous, difficult, but full of promise. Summoning the generals still loyal to him, he declares…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM62.A;”Colombia es muerte! Viva Mexico!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.T;Mexico’s Birthing Pains;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.D;Santander’s brilliant plan to dissolve Colombia and resurrect the insurrectionary state of Mexico has encountered a few small obstacles. First, the loss of Lusitania and San Salvador have sharply reduced the military and the civilian bureaucracy’s size and strength. Second, the breakdown in communications and general confusion have made it very difficult to relay orders outside of the vicinity of the capital. Third, many soldiers have either refused new orders or have departed the service entirely, becoming bandits or actively attempting to resist the new Mexican order. With both the army and the national gendarmerie in such a disorganized state, it is quite difficult to even administer Mexico, let alone bring order to it. In fact, many native communities, so long held in check by police surveillance and the threat of military incursion, have begun to organize militias to police their own communities. If these militias grow in size and strength then they could pose a severe challenge to our authority. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM63.A;Nothing that our glorious President cannot handle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.T;The Natives are Revolting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.D;With the military and the national gendarmerie forced to focus on essential duties to keep the basic apparatus of government running, many native communities have been left to fend for themselves. Rather than devolving into squalid anarchy, as many officers expected, these communities have instead rapidly assembled militias to protect themselves. Recognizing the danger this posed, Santander wisely ordered said native militias forcibly dissolved. This proved easier said than done, as the pitiful state of the military meant that in many cases the native militias outnumbered the forces sent to arrest them, and said militias pursued the authorities as they withdrew. What started as raids on government outposts has now escalated into outright rebellion, as the Tarascans, the Zapotecs, and the Nahuas have all declared independent states!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM64.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.T;The Plan of Guadalajara;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.D;It must be said that the current state of the country is less than ideal. Santander is convinced that a little patience and perseverance, and a lot of hard work, are all that is needed, but many cowardly liberals have lost faith! Gathering in the city of Guadalajara – in Jalisco, the state of his birth, no less! – they have published the “Plan of Guadalajara,” a litany of traitorous denouncements. Accusing Santander of having “committed national patricide,” they have called for new elections, the deposing and trial of Santander for treason, the reversal of centralization, and many other unpatriotic ideas! Worst of all, many soldiers have defected to this newest phase of the anti-Santander conspiracy, and Mexico finds itself even further divided as the liberals declare an insurrection across Jalisco. The stage is set for the most important battle yet for Colombia’s inheritance…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.A;Death to traitors! (Remain Mexico);;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM65.B;Sic semper tyrannus! (Play as Jalisco);;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.T;The Salvation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.D;Everywhere he goes, Santander is beset by misfortune, plagued by those who hate him, with only himself to rely upon. Everybody betrays Santander, in the end, if not now then later. The only person that he can ever have faith in is himself. Vicente, the Lusitanians, the Salvadorans, the Indians, now the Jaliscans, so many knives in his back. But Santander knows that this is the turning point against the conspiracy. This is the moment which will break them, the first step on the road to unimaginable power and success. The liberals babble that they will bring “salvation” to Mexico, but Santander knows that HE is the salvation of Mexico. Only Santander can save Mexico. Only Santander can resurrect Colombia. Only Santander can rule, and arbitrate, and govern, and bring peace. Only Santander. Only Santander. Only Santander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM66.A;Alea iacta est.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.T;Endurance of the Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.D;Victory! The Jaliscan usurpers have been annihilated, and all the ringleaders sway from the Mexico City gallows. With the traitorous liberals destroyed, Santander can now turn his attention to those infernal Indians. They had the temerity not only to reject his benevolent rule, but to humiliate his proud forces while they stabbed him in the back and tried to mutilate Mexico! HIS Mexico! The Lusitanians and Salvadorans did so as well, of course, but the blow from people as vile as the natives fell upon the President with even more bitterness. As Santander reviews his options to deal with the situation, he realizes that a simple military campaign will not be enough. No, as long as these troublesome identities persist within Santander’s realm, they will continue to be thorns in his side – the Indians and the Lusitanians are two sides of the same problem. Yes, there will need to be a reckoning, and after that, some more permanent solutions to the problems of separatism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM67.A;So much work to be done, so little time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.T;Liberalism Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.D;Victory! The reformists have shattered the legions of the mad despot Santander, and marched into Mexico City in glory. The dictator himself was found dead in his bedroom, having opened his veins with a knife like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. The hardcore Santanderistas were put on trial for treason, and the less ideological minions which he installed across Mexico have been tactfully pressured to resign in exchange for being spared. Though the reign of the tyrant has been ended, much of Mexico lies in ruins, ravaged by war, neglect, and the chaos of the previous years. While Lusitania and San Salvador show no signs of wishing to return to our fold, the native states must be dealt with. The liberals do not wish to annihilate them, as Santander wished, but their very existence is a negation of Mexican sovereignty which cannot be tolerated. The work of rebuilding Mexico must be done both within and without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM68.A;We shall make Vicente proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.T;The End of the Santanderana;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.D;Neither the liberals nor the Santanderistas have been able to prevail over the other and seize control of Mexico. Once again, the matter has been settled by the military. The young General Manuel Diaz emerged as the head of the highly secret anti-Santanderista movement within the Mexican army, a pious Catholic but also one with concealed liberal sympathies. Diaz, disgusted at Santander’s excesses and incompetence, has finally intervened, publishing the “Plan of Cuernavaca” to reveal Santander’s worst actions and call upon Mexican forces to stand down and cooperate with the Jaliscan liberals. Santander was slain in a brief gun battle when the Diazistas attempted to arrest him, and the gates of Mexico City have been opened to the liberals. Yet they arrive to find the Diazistas already preparing to insert themselves into positions of power in the new regime. Unity and democracy have returned to Mexico, but their prospects are not rosy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM69.A;Peace at any price is still peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.T;The Shadow of Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.D;When now-President Deodoro Peixoto declared Lusitania’s independence in order to escape the madness of the Santanderana, neither he nor any other Lusitanian had any illusions that doing so would be enough to secure peace. Soon, Santander will come to take revenge, and if rumors are to be believed then he may be seeking nothing less than a Carthaginian fate for Lusitania. Desperate for allies, Peixoto’s cabinet has proposed that the President swallow his pride and petition the Plantagenians for an alliance. Plantagenia certainly has no desire for a belligerent madman like Santander to place their own nation within striking distance, they argue, which will likely be the result of Lusitania attempting to face Mexico alone. Yet Peixoto knows that the Plantagenians are a greedy people who would likely demand concessions from Lusitania in return for aid. But, his ministers reply, surely bribing the Plantagenians is preferable to what would likely be death at Santander’s hands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.A;Desperate times and all that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM70.B;Lusitania bows to no master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.T;The Matter of Lusitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.D;The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. Our ministers, however, note that Lusitania currently controls the region of Cymrie, which they call Apacheria and which we have desired for quite some time. Thus, they urge us to propose that Lusitania transfer Apache to us as a dowry of our alliance. Of course, others believe that we should weaken Lusitania as a precondition for defending it, or that we should not get involved at all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.A;Make the offer : Cymrie for an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.B;We need no bribe to oppose Mexican tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM71.C;This does not involve us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.T;The Plantagenian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.D;President Peixoto’s suspicions of Plantagenian greed were confirmed when he received the reply from our delegation in Nouvelle Orleans : Plantagenia will only form an alliance with us if we transfer the Apache territory to them. Our ministers are disgusted at such predatory opportunism, but if we wish to secure Plantagenian assistance against Santander, then this seems to be our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.A;Lusitania must survive, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM72.B;We will not parcel out our homeland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.T;They Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.D;The Plantagenians have agreed to form an alliance against Santander! While we have had to offer certain economic concessions to them in order to prevent them from demanding any territory from us in exchange, they have concurred with our view that the Mexican despot presents a threat to both of our nations. When Santander comes, we will stand together against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM73.A;I never thought I’d die fighting side by side with a Frenchman…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.D;The Plantagenians have dismissed our delegation! They declared that our conflict with Santander was not their concern and have left us to our fate. It seems that the only ones who can protect Lusitania are the Lusitanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM74.A;As expected from the sons of Frenchmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.T;The Matter of Lusitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.D;The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. This may be true, but several of our ministers eye Lusitania as a possible future route for our own expansion, and others simply do not wish to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.A;Lusitania calls for aid, and Plantagenia shall answer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM75.B;Why defend a strange foreign country of which we know nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.T;The Lusitania Gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.D;Mexico is not and has never been enough for Santander. It was, like so many parts of his life, a means to an end – in this case, a means of shedding the rotting shell of Vicente’s Colombia and starting over fresh. Santander has no issue with the idea of Colombia, merely the form it took under the traitor Vicente, and the conspiracy which infested it. In fact, he intends to reforge it, except this time according to his will and his alone. Lusitania is the first step. If Santander can crush them, he reasons, then reconquering San Salvador will be simple, and then Colombia will be whole once more. Of course, word of his plan has already leaked out in the scurrilous foreign presses, and the element of surprise has to an extent been lost, but, no matter! Santander will crush the despicable Peixoto and remove his green stain of a nation from the map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM76.A;Viva el Presidente, viva Santander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM77.T;Lusitania est Pacata;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM77.D;As expected, Lusitania has been shattered by Mexican might! Their cowardly forces could not withstand our awesome assault, and we have brought their entire nation back into our fold. Peixoto had tried to flee to Plantagenia but was intercepted at the border and will be brought back to Mexico City – first for a fair trial, and then, once convicted, an equally fair public hanging. As for the Lusitanians themselves, oh, Santander has plans for them, plans to solve their separatist obsession once and for all. In the meantime, San Salvador awaits final redemption, and the President is overjoyed to see the people finally paying him the support he has always deserved. His triumph over Lusitania has convinced many to accept his rule, or at least cease to challenge it. And why should they? He is, after all, the rightful heir of Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM77.A;Veni, vidi, vici.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM78.T;The Lusitanian Catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM78.D;In a development which most people except Santander himself privately foresaw, the Mexican armies were unable to subdue Lusitania. Santander’s humiliating failure to reconquer the northern separatists has led to the shattering of his national mystique, and his supporters have rapidly abandoned him. General Manuel Diaz, who had long concealed his liberal views, proclaimed the “Plan of Tepic” as soon as he realized the scope of the Mexican defeat. He denounced Santander as a mad, murderous despot, and promised the restoration of democracy and an end to costly foreign adventures in favor of internal rebuilding. With most of the military supporting them, Diaz and his men seized Mexico City with little trouble. Santander was found dead in his bedroom, having taken a knife to himself like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. With his regime of surveillance and oppression dismantled, many liberals have begun to return from exile, eager to build a more peaceful Mexico. Distressingly, Diaz has been acclaimed as the new Mexican President, but he has sworn to rebuild and uphold the rule of law. Even if he does twist democracy in the future, cynics argue, he has little chance of being worse than Santander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM78.A;And so the Santanderana dies with a whimper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM79.T;The Death of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM79.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander /n /n For the past few years, our esteemed leader Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a conflicted legacy, albeit one defended by many fierce supporters. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and conquered Lusitania when many expected failure. Foreign critics concede that he made Mexico a stronger nation but emphasize the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities. Now that he has passed, Mexico will face even more of an uphill battle if it wants to reclaim Colombia, but the Santanderistas still burn with the fire of their icon’s ambition in their hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM79.A;Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Santander was the father of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCLM791.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander /n /n For the past few years, our esteemed leader Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a massive legacy as the man who withstood Colombia’s death and achieved its resurrection. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and reforged it stronger than before. Even foreign critics concede that he accomplished tremendous feats, and their emphasis of the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities tends to be disregarded by Colombians. Now that he has passed, thousands upon thousands gather in Mexico City to mourn the man even greater than Herrera, and the spiritual leader of Spanish Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM791.A;Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Santander was its Savior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM80.T;The Death of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM80.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander /n /n For the past few years, President Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. His generals tried to keep the news secret, but it soon leaked out and sparked public celebration, closely followed by massive pro-democracy protests. Rather than spark yet another conflict, most high-ranking Santanderistas have fled into exile, paving the way for democracy to establish itself in their place. Santander will forever be known as one of the worst tyrants of the modern era, the destroyer of Colombia and oppressor of Mexico. Foreign critics on both the left and right have rejoiced at the death of an internationally infamous despot. The unitary system which he created will likely be the only monument to his legacy which the vengeful masses do not demolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM80.A;Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Mexico is an orphan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM81.T;The Fate of Santander;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM81.D;”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander /n /n After the recent ousting of President Santander, the new regime arrested and tried him, both to furnish its image and to exorcise the Santanderana from Mexican society. Representing himself, Santander first argued that the trial was illegal as Mexico had no constitution. When the prosecution responded that treason was still criminal, Santander became enraged, accusing the entire court of being part of a vast conspiracy against him, and insisting that everything he did had been to defend Mexico. Witnesses testified about his cruelty, bigotry, and history of paranoid delusions. Towards the end of the trial, he grew prone to sudden outbursts, at one point wailing, “O World, why do you persecute me?” Condemned to death, he was taken to the Mexico City barracks and executed by firing squad. With even reactionaries disowning Santander, many now look with nostalgia towards Anastasio Vicente, who has become a secular saint of Mexican republicanism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM81.A;Vicente was the father of Colombia, and the grandfather of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM82.T;Dawn of a New Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NCLM82.D;The end of the Santanderana, and the purging of his influence from Mexican politics, has led Mexico and its people to undergo a national rebirth. Freed from the paranoid and violent atmosphere of Santander’s regime, many Mexicans are reconsidering what it means to be a “Mexican.” Colombian restorationism seems to have given way to a new Mexican nationalism, one founded upon democracy and republicanism. To that end, a constitutional conference has concluded in Oaxaca City, codifying the form of the new government. Santander’s hyper-centralism has been discarded in favor of a federal republic, with rights and responsibilities split between state and federal governments without either dominating the other. The resulting system is far from perfect, but it gives Mexico something it has never had before : an official legal foundation upon which to build a society of law and justice. Nothing makes this clearer than Mexico’s new motto…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both concepts were dismissed by Vinlanders as madness and folly, but they were founded on a noble ideal : the integration and unity of the continent. It fell to us to divine the true path, to bring ALL Arcadians, regardless of color or creed, into one family. Our economies and our political structures have now merged into one : we can no longer discern where one ends and another begins. We must all take the final step, and create an unbreakable and perpetual union, founded on principles of equality, justice, and common dignity. Now and forever, we shall be the Arcadian Federation! Thy magic binds again what custom strictly divided : All people become brothers, where thy gentle wing abides!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN1.T;The Crown Colony of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN1.D;”Be servants and you will be deservedly scorned, but fight to be citizens and you will be rightfully strengthened.” – Emil Krag, leader of the Rebellion of 1827 /n /n No colony is as dear to Scandinavia as Vinland. First briefly settled by the Norse, modern Scandinavian settlement began in the early 1600s. Scandinavians (many from Norway) and Finns tended to obtain colonial charters for the north, Germans and Scots for the south. The Scandinavian crown embraced this bifurcation by creating the colonies of Vinland and Masgirland. Plantagenia invaded Vinland in 1799, and while they were defeated, the traumatic experienced sharpened Vinlandic views that Scandinavia was not a reliable protector. The Rebellion of 1827 was sparked due to bitterness about local corruption and lack of representation or self-rule, led by the politician Emil Krag. The revolt was crushed, but both colonies have been under military occupation ever since. A single spark could light the fire anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN1.A;O Vinland, we stand on guard for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN2.T;The Crown Colony of Masgirland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN2.D;Masgirland, while settled at the same time as Vinland, has developed a separate identity, mainly due to the difference in its colonization. Unlike Vinland, it was mainly settled by the Germans and the Scottish. The situation in Masgirland is further complicated due to its economy. Much of the colony is reliant upon fishing, and thus upon European export markets. This has led Masgirlanders to, ironically, see themselves as closer to the Scandinavian colonial authorities than the mostly Nordic Vinlanders, who are much more militant about independence and republicanism. While Masgirland has its own discontents about lack of representation within Scandinavia, should Vinland make another bid for freedom, Masgirlanders may struggle to choose a side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN2.A;The small protected by the great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN3.T;The Skraelingr Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN3.D;For many European settlers, the Great Lakes is a barbarian region where civilization has yet to spread. For philosophers, this is a Garden of Eden where noble savages thrive. For Scandinavia, this is their most remote colony. For most of the local tribes - the hundreds of Algonquin and Iroquois nations that inhabit the region and who answer to the Scandinavian governor - the so-called Skraelingr Council allows them to live in relative peace. But as Vinlanders ask for independence, while the Plantagenians and Belgians eye the border territories, the differences between the Algonquins and the Iroquois are thrown into sharp relief. Europeans may have lumped them together, but they are not one people, not yet at least. Soon they will once again march to war, but will it be against each other or against the settlers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN3.A;Wait – you’re saying there isn’t one big Skraelingr tribe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIN4.T;The Rebellion of 1837;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN4.D;Olaf Larsson, a Vinlandic fur trader of minor renown, has been dissatisfied with the steep Scandinavian tariffs which have greatly cut into his business, and has radicalized into a militant republican. Hoping to ignite a popular revolution against Scandinavian rule, he and a small group of sympathizers held a meeting in which they declared the “Vinlandic Republic” with Larsson as provisional president. This “Executive Council of Vinland” then seized a printing press and began printing announcements of the “creation of the Vinlandic Republic” and exhorting the people to rise. Larsson and company rode across the area, distributing them to whoever they found and goading several mobs to attack Scandinavian patrols. Ultimately, however, many people were more amused or confused by their efforts than inspired, and the “Executive Council” was apprehended by the authorities days after the incident began. However, Larsson’s propaganda is still circulating within the colony, stirring independence sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN4.A;Just another rabble-rouser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN5.T;The Rebellion of 1839;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN5.D;Larsson’s “revolt” of two years ago was a farce, but the radical liberal literature which he distributed has imbued new emotional vibrancy into the VInlandic independence movement. One group which has seen a revival of its fortunes is the Samfunn af Patrioter (Society of Patriots), a secret independence society led by politician Kresten Søndergaard. A small fight in Erikshavn between the Patrioter and several members of the Leifssonklub, clandestine loyalists, soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest, summoning hundreds of members into the countryside to protect the fleeing fugitives. After fending off several Scando-Vinlandic search parties and beginning to snowball in strength and numbers, the Patrioter militia was finally defeated near the frontier of the Belgian Confederacy. We were surprised to learn that Søndergaard himself had been leading the rebels! He is now in custody, and will soon stand trial for treason and insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN5.A;We’ve got a nice necktie already picked out for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN6.T;The Vinlandic Rebellion of 1839;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN6.D;Our Arcadian colonies of Vinland and Masgirland have been under military occupation since the Rebellion of 1827 threatened to pull both out of our empire. Since then, several secret societies have been organizing in support of radical liberalism. One such group is the Samfunn af Patrioter, a secret independence society led by former politician-turned-activist Kresten Søndergaard. A small fight in Erikshavn between the Patrioter and several members of the Leifssonklub, clandestine loyalists, soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest, summoning hundreds of members into the countryside to protect the fleeing fugitives. After fending off several search parties and beginning to snowball in strength and numbers, the Patrioter militia was finally defeated near the frontier of the Belgian Confederacy. We were surprised to learn that Søndergaard himself had been leading the rebels! He is now in custody, and will soon stand trial for treason and insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN6.A;Send me a postcard from the hanging!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN7.T;Søndergaard Escapes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN7.D;Søndergaard’s trial, despite the Patrioter’s theatrics, was fairly straightforward – the evidence against him was considerable and despite several eloquent speeches from the defendant, his guilt fairly obvious. Condemned to death, he was held under armed guard in Elvemunning Prison in Erikshavn, before being transported to the town square for public execution. As the transport was passing beneath a bridge, however, a single Patriot dashed into the road and aimed a pistol at the driver, ordering him to stop! Simultaneously, a large group of Patriot men leapt over a nearby wall, rushed the vehicle, and forced open the doors. Søndergaard was quickly freed before the mob dispersed in advance of Scandinavian reinforcements. Despite an ongoing manhunt, Søndergaard has yet to be found, and is believed to have fled the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN7.A;We must recapture him at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN9.T;The Martydom of Kresten Søndergaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN9.D;With news of Søndergaard’s escape rapidly spreading, it was thought that he wouldn’t be able to hide for long. Thus the Vinlandic government was frustrated at the lack of the search’s progress – until a certain horrid tale reached them. Apparently, Søndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a week ago. Rather than report his capture, the patrol – several of whom had family members who were killed by Patrioter in 1827 and 1839 – decided to enact their own revenge. For days, Søndergaard was tortured in the basement of an abandoned hunting lodge, eventually dying of his wounds. Although the Vinlandic governor demanded that this remain secret, information has a way of leaking out. A fortnight later, the newspaper headlines scream of “THE AGONY OF SØNDERGAARD.” Slowly, people who read the ghastly tale, people who had never been all that political before, begin to discover within themselves a love of liberty, and a hatred of the Scandinavian Crown and the blood-soaked regime that it is propping up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN9.A;His soul is marching on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN10.T;The Martydom of Kresten Søndergaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN10.D;With news of Søndergaard’s escape rapidly spreading, it was thought that he wouldn’t be able to hide for long. It seems, however, that this story has had a horrifying new development. Apparently, Søndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a month ago. Rather than report his capture, the patrol – several of whom had family members who had died in the rebellions of 1827 and 1839 – decided to enact their own revenge.

Although the Vinlandic governor demanded that this remain secret, information has a way of leaking out. A fortnight later, the newspaper headlines screamed of “THE AGONY OF SØNDERGAARD.” With Scandinavia having taken a highly public role in the hunt for Søndergaard, we have found ourselves accused of being the puppet masters of a savage and murderous regime. Even liberals at home are denouncing our occupation of Vinland now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN10.A;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN11,T;The Martydrom of Kresten Søndergaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN11.D;Kresten Søndergaard is the leader of the Vinlandic nationalist group the Samfunn af Patrioter, recently captured and sentenced to death only to escape. It was thought that he wouldn’t be able to hide for long, but it seems that this story has had a terrible new development. Apparently, Søndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a month ago. Rather than report his capture, the patrol – several of whom had family members who had died in the rebellions of 1827 and 1839 – decided to enact their own revenge. For days, Søndergaard was tortured in the basement of an abandoned hunting lodge, eventually dying of his wounds. All of this was recently revealed in newspaper headlines screaming of “THE AGONY OF SØNDERGAARD.” Many Masgirlanders are horrified at the story, and most seem to be blaming the Vinlandic colonial government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN11.A;How barbaric!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN12.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN12.D;The recent loss of Scandinavian control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government into their ranks. Each cell then organized a militia, to be called upon when the time came. That time came about four days ago, when a Scandinavian unit attempted to arrest a Patrioter cell within the Kusbole militia and their comrades came out to defend them. The standoff soon became a battle, one which signaled the initiation of a full-scale Patrioter uprising. Vinlandic officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioters as news of the rebellion spread, and with Scandinavia unable to contain the rebellion, it even spread into Masgirland. Both colonies’ capitals have been seized and the banners of liberal democracy lifted high above Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN13.D;The recent loss of Scandinavian control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, and now a battle between a Scandinavian patrol and a Patrioter militia has stirred them to action. A wave of rebellions swept across the colony, and Vinlandic officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioters as news of the revolt spread. The failure of the Scandinavian military to crush the rebellion early allowed it to achieve unprecedented success. Now, cities across Scandinavian Arcadia have been overrun, and the revolt has spread into Masgirland. As the Scandinavian banner is torn down and the banner of liberal democracy raised in its place, it appears that our empire has been cast out of Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN13.A;How could this have happened!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN14.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN14.D;The recent abolition of the Scandinavian monarchy has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government and organizing a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came when word reached Vinland of the ousting of the Stuart dynasty. Nielsson quickly marshalled the Patrioter to Erikshavn, where his agents within the colonial government ushered him and his army into the halls of power. Dismissing the governor, Nielsson and the Patrioter proclaimed the Vinlandic Republic, promising to organize a constitutional convention as soon as possible to establish the legal foundation of the new state. The flames of revolution have already spread to Masgirland as well. As Scandinavia shakes off the shackles of monarchy, its Arcadian children cast off their own bonds and claim their newfound freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN16.T;A New Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN16.D;The recent independence of the Vinlandic Republic has sent shock waves across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the rising tide of revolution, and as the new political order inflames our own institutions, we are drifting into the orbit of Vinland more than ever before. For now, we have managed to forestall annexation, but the Vinlanders have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from Scandinavia. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, more than a few Masgirlanders look back upon their fatherland with longing, less so upon their new would-be masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN16.A;We want to remain who we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN17.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN17.D;The entrance of Scandinavia into a major European war has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson, the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government and organizing a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came when Scandinavia was forced to curtail its presence in Arcadia due to developments in Europe. The reduced military presence allowed the Patrioter to organize with far greater ease and boldness. Now, they have made their move. Using inside agents recruited from the remaining Scandinavian garrisons, the Patrioter have seized key military and civilian strongpoints across the colony. This has allowed them to swiftly eject the colonial regime from power, installing Nielsson as provisional president pending a constitutional convention. Scandinavia’s weakened grip has allowed Vinland to slip from its mailed fist and soar into freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN18.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN18.D;Vinlandic republicanism has now reached a fever pitch of intensity and power. None embody this better than Vilhelm Schoultz, second-in-command to Vinlandic nationalist Johan Nielsson of the Samfunn af Patrioter. Schoultz, an extremist even by the Samfunn’s standards, successfully contested the leadership in an emergency meeting of the Patrioter’s executive council. He then ordered the mobilization of the Samfunn’s militias and directed them to capture military and civilian targets across Vinland. The battles that followed throughout the colony drew in many volunteers seeking to fight for Vinlandic freedom. With many Erikshavners holding bitter memories of military atrocities, they greatly aided Schoultz’s seizure of the city. Soon, he entered the governor’s office and proclaimed himself Grunnlovens Forsvarar (Constitutional Defender) of the revolutionary Vinlandic Republic. As Patrioter cells carry the revolution into Masgirland and the falløkser are raised up across Vinland, the Tiden av den Røde has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, many Masgirlanders are alarmed at the reports of escalating anti-monarchist violence sweeping Vinland…particularly news of ominous bladed contraptions being erected in city squares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN20.T;The Vinlandic Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN20.D;The Vinlanders did not react well to the news that Copenhagen had discarded their petition for independence. In fact, they reacted so badly that a radical extremist named Vilhelm Schoultz was able to seize control of the Vinlandic independence movement and orchestrate a violent revolution across the colony. With much of Scandinavian Arcadia lost, loyal military and civilian personnel have fallen back to the island of Olavsstad to await reinforcements. We now must decide whether we should indeed attempt to reconquer our Arcadian lands, or accept their loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have declared war upon us, and soon an army of conquest shall arrive upon our shores to bolster the rats which have nested in Olavsstad. Our glorious Grunnlovens Forsvarar Schoultz is already marshalling the new Vinlandic Revolutionary Army to throw them back into the sea! We shall fall upon them with the Viking fury which burns within the heart of all Vinlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN22.T;The Treaty of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN22.D;The Scandinavian military has met with a humiliating defeat in the New World. Unable to subdue the insurrectionary colonials, we have finally been forced to admit that the war to reconquer Scandinavian Arcadia is lost. A treaty has been signed in Venice, in which Vinland and Masgirland have both been granted independence. As bitter recriminations echo throughout the streets of Copenhagen, the inferno of revolution burns bright in the West, for good or for ill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN22.A;As it was ages ago, the west is lost to us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.T;The Lion of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.D;Victory at last! The mad Schoultz and his murderous legions have been destroyed, and Scandinavian Arcadia is back in the hands of the Crown. As our soldiers fan out across the region, all the criminals and traitors of the illegitimate “Republic” shall be hunted down like the vermin they are. Meanwhile, our loyal subjects rejoice in our victory, and the restoration of enlightened government across the land. The main question now is what to do with our liberated colonies. Clearly, permanent occupation is unworkable. Some have proposed to appoint younger cousins of the sovereign as rulers of Kingdoms of Vinland and Masgirland. Others feel that the only way to prevent more chaos in the New World is to assume direct rule across Scandinavian Arcadia. How shall we deal with our wayward colonies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN222.A;Create the Kingdoms of Vinland and Masgirland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN23.T;The Radicalist Uprising in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN23.D;The growth of radical liberalism across the world has finally spread to Vinland. Johan Nielsson, leader of the militant republican Samfunn af Patrioter, has been gathering weapons for some time. Under pressure from extremist elements within the movement to act, Nielsson decided to launch a coup with limited resources local to Erikshavn. Less than a day ago, the Patrioter stormed out into the city and seized various strategic locations, with Nielsson himself leading a contingent to march to the governor’s office and present a petition demanding immediate independence. Rather than negotiate, the governor locked himself inside. Nielsson then seemed to hesitate, but upon hearing the approach of Vinlandic and Scandinavian troops, ordered his supporters to surround the building and barricade themselves within the city square, effectively taking the governor and the whole city center hostage. As Vinlandic forces attempt to restore order, all of Erikshavn sits on a knife edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN23.A;We shall sweep Erikshavn clean of these vermin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.T;The Erikshavn Bloodbath;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.D;Knowing that the governor and the seat of Vinlandic government were in extreme danger, we urged our officers to quickly rescue them. Unfortunately, they interpreted this order rather…loosely. Lurid and rapidly spreading tales of unarmed rebels shot while fleeing, assaults on civilians suspected of collaboration with the Patrioter, and savage acts against female fighters has inflamed all of Vinland. Stories of rebels lured out with offers of amnesty being executed after surrendering their weapons has drawn outrage. Worst of all, the battle to reclaim the city square and save the governor turned into a meat grinder, with house-to-house fighting and Nielsson dying in a hail of bullets on the steps of the governor’s office. The whole scene has played straight into the republican narrative of revolutionary martyrdom, and Patrioter cells across Vinland are activating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN24.A;For God’s sake, we were only hunting terrorists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.T;An Unfortunate Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.D;The governor has convened his advisors and officers to consider the current situation in the colony, and the mood around the room is grim. Recent reports suggest that many Vinlandic cities could see Patrioter uprisings of their own very soon. Even in places where republicanism is weak, there is a general sense that the royal Vinlandic government has destroyed its own mandate to govern, and that it has lost the respect and the trust of the people. Though the governor’s officers are adamant that they cannot give in to the republican conspiracy, the civilian part of the council is convinced that the only way to avoid a revolution is to obtain independence. However, their plan would involve a partitioning of the Skraelingr Territory, along with privately guaranteeing Scandinavia a large stake in an independent Vinland to allow many of those in power to maintain their influence. This, they claim, would allow us to satisfy the minimal demands of the republicans while giving them the least amount of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.A;We are still Scandinavians! No surrender to the Patrioter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN250.B;If we have a trick up our sleeve then now is the time to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.T;Vinland Requests Conditional Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.D;We have received a strange and shocking petition from our Vinlandic colony : they have asked us for independence! However, this request was made with a lengthy explanation attached. To summarize, the colony is on the verge of revolution, and the governor’s council sees independence as the only way to avert it. They have a plan : partition the Skraelingr Territory, and secretly sell off large amounts of state corporation stock to Scandinavian investors, along with giving Scandinavian political organizations free reign to operate within Vinland. Furthermore, they will do their utmost to keep as many Scandinavian loyalists in power as possible. This, they say, will preserve the maximum amount of Scandinavian influence within Vinland. They stress that a military solution is no longer feasible and have ended their petition with a desperate plea for the Scandinavian monarch to consider the plight of their “Vinlandic brethren.” Should we accept their request?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.A;No, demand that they crush the traitors at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN25.B;Yes, a loyal republic is preferable to a homicidal one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.T;The Independence of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.D;In a ceremony in Erikshavn, representatives of the Scandinavian Crown met with the new Vinlandic Provisional Council. They presented the Council with the royal charter that created the Crown Colony of Vinland, with the transfer of the charter representing the transfer of authority from the Scandinavian monarch to us. The Scandinavian and the Royal Vinlandic flags were then lowered for the final time, and the flag of the Vinlandic Republic raised, snapping into the wind above the new Presidential Office to cheering applause. Some, however, question if we are truly free of Copenhagen. While we are no longer royal subjects, Scandinavian money flows through the veins of Vinlandic commerce, and Scandinavian political organizations have put down roots in Vinland. Even the Vinlandic spirit of rugged individualism seems to have been tinged by Nordic communalism and aristocracy. Only time will tell what shape our new nation shall take, but one thing is clear : it will not be the shape which the Patrioter had envisioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN26.A;Enhed, retfærdighed, frihed (Unity, justice, freedom).;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.T;A New Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.D;The recent independence of the Vinlandic Republic has sent dominoes falling across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the political fervor, and as the new order permeates our own institutions, we are drifting into the orbit of Vinland more than ever before. For now, we have managed to forestall annexation, but the Vinlanders have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from Scandinavia. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention, many Masgirlanders are uncertain whether to believe the rumors that Scandinavia’s loss of control over northeastern Arcadia is not as complete as the Vinlanders claim…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN27.A;We want to remain who we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.T;The Vinlandic Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.D;With the newfound independence of Vinland, the first order of business is to establish exactly what legal foundation the country shall rest upon. Though the nation’s status as a republic has been confirmed, many aspects of its laws are still up in the air. Many delegates seem to be separating out into four political camps : the liberals, the conservatives, the reactionaries, and the radicals. The group that manages to sway most of the convention to its side will gain tremendous power to shape the destiny of the new nation. §RIf a particularly extreme faction manages to come out on top, however, the resulting instability could topple the republic.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN28.A;Let us forge a strong foundation for our future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.T;The Question of the Voting System;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN29.D;The first major question to arise during debate was what form the Vinlandic voting system should adopt. Conservatives, fearful of a “mobocracy,” have stressed that only landowning men have the personal responsibility and resources to be trusted with the vote. Liberals scoffed at such “feudal” ideas but believed that there still should be certain qualifications based on wealth. Radicals, aghast at the mere suggestion of voting restrictions, demanded nothing less than universal male suffrage, arguing that democratic representation is the issue which drove Vinland to seek independence in the first place and that it would be both unethical and hypocritical to deny it to its citizens in turn.

VIN30.T;The Question of the Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN30.D;The next issue to arise during debate was the form of the Vinlandic upper house. As the organ of the legislature expected to have the greatest influence on lawmaking, its composition is of critical importance. The conservatives, continuing their previous theme, argued that a property-based allocation for the upper house is the only way to prevent the government from being overrun by populism. Liberals, scorning the notion of a “republican aristocracy,” laid out what they claimed was the fairest arrangement possible : two representatives per state of Vinland, giving each constituent part an equal voice. The radicals, however, argued that both ideas presented too many opportunities to silence the voice of the people, and believed that only a regularly adjusted population-based weighting, backed up by regular censuses, could truly reflect the Vinlandic popular will. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN31.T;The Question of Native Enfranchisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.D;The next issue to arise during debate was whether to extend the franchise to native Vinlanders. The topic sparked sharp debate and inspired some rather acidic remarks from the less cosmopolitan delegates. The conservatives deployed manifold arguments against native suffrage, from racial science theories to denigration of the natives’ moral character, to disputing the citizenship of non-European Vinlanders, and all sorts of other defenses against the idea. On this topic, however, the liberals and radicals closed ranks. Vinland, unlike other Euro-Arcadian nations, has always seen closer racial integration between European and native peoples. Native Vinlanders, the liberals and radicals reminded the conservatives, fought in the Great Arcadian War against the Plantagenians, buoyed the Vinlandic economy for centuries, and were the ancestors of “many delegates in this room.” To deny them suffrage, they argued, would be an insult to history and the very essence of Vinland. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.A;To extend suffrage only to European-descended men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN31.B;To extend suffrage to all Vinlandic men, regardless of race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.T;The Question of Native Land Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.D;The next issue to arise during debate was how to address native lands within Vinland. Due to the complex ethnic makeup of Vinland, the topic has many implications for Vinland’s economic and societal future. The conservatives conceded that the natives should be able to petition the government for their lands but urged that this be qualified by guarantees that said natives would seek to better themselves and their lands, bringing both up to “civilized” standards. Liberals denounced the conservatives for “demanding that natives navigate legal mazes to secure their own homes,” and proposed to create a commission to review and process native land claims. Radicals, however, astonished even the liberals by demanding that native lands be placed under special jurisdiction to weigh elections in natives’ favor, and even allow native councils to pass ordinances to restrict or bar Europeans from entering! The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.A;The conservative option of voluntary land reclamation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
VIN32.B;The liberal option of a commission to adjudicate native land claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN32.C;The radical option of extensive native rights measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.T;The Question of the Head of State;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.D;The last issue to arise during debate was what powers the head of state should receive. This was a contentious issue, as the role of the head of state is intimately connected to the form of the Vinlandic government writ large. The conservatives came out swinging, declaring that the only way to prevent Vinland from sliding back into chaos was to establish a centralized government with a strong President to unify the nation and provide consistent leadership. The radicals led the charge against such plans, denouncing them as “Caesarism-in-waiting.” They instead urged the convention to embrace a federal model with a purely ceremonial head of state, to keep power diffused across the government rather than concentrated in one place. The debate seemed to have split the liberals, and supporters for both proposals could be found on both sides, though a plurality of them favored the federal option. The convention eventually chose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.A;The conservative option of a strong President.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN33.B;The radical option of a ceremonial President.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.T;The End of the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.D;The Vinlandic Constitutional Convention has now concluded. All the delegates have signed the constitution, but in order to be ratified and thus enter force, it must be approved by the people. As the convention decided in one of their final votes, the constitution shall be put to a nationwide referendum on whether to adopt it. While many hope that such a process will be a mere formality, others worry that the delegates may have misjudged the national mood and deviated too far from what the average Vinlander will accept. Whatever the case, the answer will soon become clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN34.A;What does the voice of the people say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.T;The Liberal Constitution is Adopted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has passed, and the liberal constitution has been accepted by the Vinlandic people. Though some liberal delegates feared that they’d pushed too far at the convention, the document guaranteeing protections for personal liberties without extreme shifts in Vinlandic society has been met with general approval. Even better, the news of the liberal program being promulgated has shifted opinion in Masgirland decisively in favor of becoming the newest state of Vinland, and they have already petitioned for annexation! As Vinland strides forward into the future, it does so basking under the glow of liberty, equality, and fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN35.A;We have it in our power to begin the world over again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.T;The Conservative Constitution is Adopted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has passed, and the conservative constitution has been accepted by the Vinlandic people. Though some conservative delegates feared that they’d compromised too little at the convention, the document guaranteeing a republic founded on traditional Vinlandic principles has been met with general approval. Even better, the news of the conservative program being promulgated has been met with warm reception in Masgirland – so much so that they have already petitioned for annexation! As Vinland strides forward into the future, it does so as it always has : for God and for Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN36.A;Politics is a game requiring great coolness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.T;The Reactionary Constitution Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has been defeated, and the reactionary constitution rejected by the people. The document’s extensive restrictions upon personal liberties, and its establishment of a virtual “republican aristocracy,” met with widespread condemnation from an electorate which felt that the proposed constitution represented the very ideas that they’d been warring against for decades. Many former Patrioter members have abandoned the government in disgust, leaving a skeletal assortment of conservative and reactionary politicians in control. The provisional president was among those to leave, and so Vidkun Hammarskjöld, a historian by training and the scion of a wealthy Vinlandic merchant family, has been sworn in as President. His first act has been to declare the constitution “adopted by executive order,” compounding the sense of outrage across Vinlandic society towards the high-handed government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN37.A;I’m sure that he has a plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.T;The Creation of the Kingdom of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.D;Hammarskjöld is, foremost, a historian. He knows that republics have often proved weak and feeble in the long run, in contrast to monarchies. Ancient Greek and Roman history are replete with examples, to say nothing of the fate of republics in the Great German Wars. Thus, he decided, like Augustus once did, that the only way to save the republic was to destroy it. In an ornate ceremony, he was coronated Vidkun the First, King of Vinland, with his close friend Frederick Michelsen made his Chancellor. It was supposed to be a triumph, with most of Erikshavn expected to attend and even foreign dignitaries invited. This did not come to pass. Many people simply ignored the ceremony, and the only foreign dignitaries to arrive were a Burgundian author and his Incan attendant. The most painful part of the day came when Michelsen, standing before a crowd of a hundred or so diehard monarchists, requested them to acclaim their new sovereign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN38.A;Long live the King!...Please applaud. Please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.T;Chaos in Erikshavn;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.D;When the Vinlandic Republic was declared, most republicans thought that their mission was accomplished. News of Vidkun’s coronation, however, awoke fresh fury within them. Within days after the ceremony, street riots by angry Erikshavners have become a common occurrence. Wrathful broadsheets have been turning up across the city with such cheerful messages as exhortations to cast the new monarch into the Frysja River. Worst of all, Haakon Jensen, nephew of former Samfunn af Patrioter leader Johan Nielsson, has reactivated the Patrioter’s old network to create the Vinlandic Republikanske Brorskapet (Vinlandic Republican Brotherhood, VRB), and has called upon “all loyal and free Vinlanders” to rise up and destroy the “tyrant in our midst.” VRB militias wearing white-and-red Patrioter-style armbands have been spotted prowling the city, and law and order in Erikshavn is breaking down. If the first reports of VRB units springing up in other cities are any indication, all of Vinland is not far behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN39.A;How could they betray King Vidkun like this!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.T;The Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN40.D;Jensen, having learned from veteran paramilitary commanders, had little trouble taking advantage of the current chaos to secure men and weapons for the VRB. With many republican soldiers defecting to him, he soon felt confident enough to stage a coup. Using old plans for the seizure of the colonial government, VRB men deployed from their bases to seize transportation, communication, and military centers across Erikshavn, before Jensen and his most trusted comrades led a contingent to the royal palace. The Vinlandic military was able to hold the harbor, however, with significant consequences. Warned by a monarchist insider within the VRB, the King was able to evacuate along with the rest of the royal family and the chief government ministers before Jensen could capture them. They have now fled to Masgirland, last bastion of reaction, as the VRB rise up throughout the nation and Jensen organizes an Executive Council with himself as President to rule the restored Vinlandic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN41.T;The Radical Constitution Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN41.D;With most of the results in from the provinces, the referendum has been defeated, and the radical constitution rejected by the people. The document’s tremendous changes to many traditional aspects of Vinlandic society alienated an electorate which felt that the proposed constitution did not reflect their values. The radicals, unfazed, declared that the “will of the people” would not be “suppressed,” and pronounced the constitution adopted despite the referendum’s result. Many conservatives have made baleful predictions that its terms will allow radicals to dominate the government. These fears were compounded when Vilhelm Schoultz, famous liberal extremist, easily won election as the nation’s Førstesekretær (First Secretary), the head of government. Although Schoultz has promised an equal voice for all Vinlanders, few believe him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN41.A;Those who sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither and will lose both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.T;The First Sitting of the Vinlandic Stortinget;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.D;”Order! ORDER!” /n /n As the conservatives had feared, the radicals have bent quite a few laws in their favor. Multiple elections have allegedly been rigged under the guise of “ensuring full participation,” creating a radical near majority in the Stortinget. Even without voting fraud, radical candidates swept elections with populist programs and vast amounts of mudslinging. When reactionary SM Vidkun Hammarskjöld voted against a bill to ban state funding of religious organizations and Førstesekretær Schoultz ordered the stortingetformann (assembly chairman) to discard his vote, the entire room erupted into violence, with some older SMs shouting Patriot or Leifsson slogans. After the brawl subsided, conservatives staged a walkout, with Hammarskjöld denouncing Schoultz’s government as a sham and a dictatorship. Even some liberals have expressed disgust at the radicals’ “trampling” of democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN42.A;But, government is too important to be left to reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN43.T;Declaration of the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN43.D;”Vinland is now under siege by enemies foreign and domestic. To defend the nation, we have created the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité (Revolutionary Security Committee) and assumed the burden of governance. What is necessary now is terror, not as chaos, but as exceptional and revolutionary justice. If virtue is the spring of a popular government in times of peace, the spring of that government during a revolution is virtue combined with terror : virtue, without which terror is destructive : terror, without which virtue is impotent. The government in a revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.” - Grunnlovens Forsvarar Schoultz /n /n Citing urgent necessity, the Vinlandic government has been overthrown in a self-coup by Schoultz’s radicals, with Schoultz becoming Grunnlovens Forsvarar (Constitutional Defender). Conservatives have fled to Masgirland, as the falløkser are raised up and the Tiden av den Røde dawns across Vinland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIN44.T;The Declaration of Masgirlandic Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN44.D;With Vinland submerged into revolutionary chaos, Masgirland has become the bastion of sanity and reason in north Arcadia. To avoid being swept up into the new monstrosity to our west, it has been decided to officially declare the independence of Masgirland. Founded in tradition and the resilience of our people, Masgirland will prevail against the madness of Erikshavn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN44.A;Masgirlanders never will be slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.T;A Deal With the Devil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.D;We have secured Masgirland’s existence as an independent state, but as things stand it will not stay that way for long. Even now, the madmen in Vinland are preparing to crush us – and nobody in Masgirland has any desire to be introduced to Fru Falløks (Madame Fall-Axe), their horrid name for those homicidal contraptions. Thus, some officers have approached His Majesty and his council with a proposal : request aid from Scandinavia. The advantages are obvious. Masgirland is a small and weak country, whereas Scandinavia is a great power. Their assistance would be a tremendous boon. However, the risks are also obvious. §RIf we allow Scandinavia an entrance back into power in Masgirland, let alone Vinland, it is highly likely that they will never leave – we stand a strong chance of being recolonized.§ But even so, it might be better than to meet our deaths by means of murderous machines amidst jeering crowds…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.A;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN45.B;Better to fight and die than to live and serve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.T;The Masgirlandic Plea;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.D;It seems that the situation in Nordic Arcadia is dire. Word has reached us that Vinland has been seized by a radical liberal regime, and the conservatives have retreated to Masgirland and declared an independent kingdom. However, Vinland will likely soon invade them…which is why they have turned to us. Masgirland has offered us significant economic and political concessions if we agree to defend them during the imminent Vinlandic invasion. Many of our officers have excitedly pointed out that, if we are successful, we could use this as a pretext to occupy and retake Masgirland, and potentially Vinland as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.A;We won’t come back ‘til it’s over over there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN46.B;The Masgirlanders have made their bed, and now they shall die in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.T;Scandinavia Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.D;We have received word that our former colonial overlords have agreed to protect us from the Vinlandic menace! Their ambassador seemed strangely distracted while delivering the news, as if he was taking note of certain parts of the city. Regardless, we shall not fight the Vinlanders alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN47.A;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.T;Scandinavia Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.D;We have received word that our former colonial overlords have refused to protect us from the Vinlandic menace! It seems that they blame us for not supporting them enough in the past to prevent the Vinlandic radicals from causing them to leave their Arcadian colonies in the first place. This bizarre logic aside, we must stand alone against Vinland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN48.A;Horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.T;The North Arcadian Brothers’ War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.D;When Vinland and Masgirland were founded, they were often referred to as the “Two Brothers” or the “Two Sisters,” for they were alike in parentage yet dissimilar in manner and composition. That term was once one of affection and unity. Now, it has become something else : a dark rumination on imminent fratricide. As the Vinlandic Revolutionary Army storms towards the reactionary bastion of Masgirland, the Masgirlanders fortify their communities and prepare for the onslaught. At stake is the ideological foundation of Nordic Arcadia, torn between the militant republicanism and liberalism of Vinland, and the rich traditionalism and anti-radicalism of Masgirland. Regardless of who prevails, the psychological wounds will echo across north Arcadia forever. There is about to be a death in the Nordic family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN49.A;Am I my brother’s keeper?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.T;Victory of the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.D;We have conquered! The Masgirlandic reactionaries stood no chance against the righteous armies of the Vinlandic Republic. As the remaining monarchists are ferreted out, we have decided to take strong measures to prevent any future resurgence of conservative Masgirlandic nationalism. Masgirland will be annexed, not as a single unit, but split into separate states within Vinland itself. All individuals currently holding political office in Masgirland will be turned out. Finally, the curriculum in the former Masgirland will be adjusted to support cultural unity with Vinland. We will secure, defend, and consolidate the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN50.A;Vinlandia invicta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.T;Victory over the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.D;God be praised! The rebels have been shattered by the righteous armies of our glorious King. As the remaining republicans are ferreted out, the royal family has returned to Erikshavn in triumph. His first act has been to declare the annexation of Masgirland into Vinland, albeit with protections for local autonomies. The people rejoice at the destruction of the barbaric usurpers and the restoration of the sovereign to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN51.A;And we didn’t even have to ask them to applaud this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.T;Victory over the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.D;Masgirland has triumphed! The insane Vinlandic radicals and their murderous leader could not stand up to a truly free and proud people willing to fight for their rights and their traditions. With the Vinlandic invasion force destroyed, the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité’s popularity has plunged precipitously and Schoultz is now in dire straits.  But while some conservatives express a desire to return home to Vinland as soon as the radical regime is deposed, others have decided to take up permanent residence in the land which they have stood for and fought for. The defeat of radicalism is the dawn of a new and free Masgirland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN52.A;Let freedom ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.T;The Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.D;The failure of our invasion of Masgirland has dealt a catastrophic blow to the regime. Where the people once were willing to forgive our more extreme actions in the name of liberation, now they denounce us as tyrants and demagogues who lied to the public to seize power. The Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité attempted to give a public address to rally support for our government, but during the speeches, a revolutionary guardsmen got into a struggle with some rock-throwing hecklers and accidentally discharged his rifle, shooting one dead. This highly visible killing led the already tense crowd to riot, spiraling into citywide violence. By nightfall, Schoultz and the rest of the Komité had been thrown into Elvemunning Prison by their own guards. A Provisional Council comprised of various non-radical politicians (albeit with a conservative bent) has been formed pending new elections, and the Komité will soon face trial for treason. Fru Falløks’ final victims may very well be her old masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN53.A;Like Saturn, the revolution devours its children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.T;The Lion Has Landed;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.D;With the war in north Arcadia over, Scandinavian officers across the area were awaiting the recall order to return home. Thus, all of them were surprised to receive new orders in circumstances of great secrecy by messengers they’d never seen before. Once received, however, they were unflinchingly obeyed. Soon, each Scandinavian unit marched on the nearest city, port, or military base, securing them in the name of the Scandinavian Crown. Across the area, the flags of Vinland have been torn down, and the Rigernes Banner hoisted in their place. With most of the country occupied, Scandinavian forces converged on Erikshavn, deposed the monarchy, and installed the new colonial governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN54.A;Guess who’s back, back again…;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN55.T;The Restoration of the Dominion of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIN55.D;In what can only be described as an act of divine providence, the destruction of the republican regime in Vinland by the Scando-Masgirlandic forces provided us with a golden opportunity to seize the whole nation. Our army is now in control of Vinland, and the people – having endured an incompetent and reactionary democracy, an equally incompetent farce of a monarchy, a violent insurrectionary republic, and a major war – seem to have accepted our return, at least for now. We shall likely need to address the Vinlandic Question again in the future but at this time Scandinavia has returned to Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPAN1.T;The Revolution of 1808 and its Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN1.D;For centuries, Spain built an empire on the exorbitant wealth it extracted from its colonies. This massive undertaking, however, had its costs. Beyond the tremendous economic and societal transformations, Spain developed a culture of conservative aristocracy backstopped by colonial wealth. In 1808, the liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne and attempted to introduce long-overdue liberal reforms at home, as well as increasing colonial trade and the power of New World elites. The Dual Monarchy could not accept this and backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After winning the brutal Peninsular War in 1815, Pedro reasserted liberalism and issued his own “Petrine Reforms.” They sharply curtailed colonial trade and reinforced the power of European-born elites, triggering the formation of the Columbian Alliance against us. The last few decades have not been kind to Spain, and if the increasing furor of Spanish liberals is anything to gauge things by, the next few decades may not be kind, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN1.A;Viva el Rey, Alfonso XV de Lorraine-Aviz! Viva España!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN2.T;La Nación Dividida;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN2.D;The notion of Spain as a fractured nation is not new. It was felt in the seventeenth century, when Miguel Cervantes published The Ingenious Gentleman Dom Quixote de los Algarves, the famous story of a mad aristocrat returning to chivalry in a modern world. This well encapsulates the divide of our nation, between liberal and conservative, maritime and terrestrial, modernity and tradition…Spain and Castile. The eastern region of Castile has long chafed under the western centralization which came with the ascent of the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty. Pedro III moved the capital to Madrid to reconnect with the neglected region, much to the anger of the west, yet even this may not have been enough. The liberals demand a return to Lisbon, and the reactionaries denounce this idea with equal fire and fury. Romantic poets have begun to speak of “Castile” as something unique and rooted in ancient ways. If Spain is to ever see true reform take root, the Castilian question will need to be answered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN2.A;”Por uma pequena amostra podemos julgar de toda a peça.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.T;The Winds of Change;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.D;The recovery of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, at the expense of New Spain, has sent shockwaves through the Spanish political establishment. Both liberals and conservatives are claiming victory by interpreting the event through different lenses : the former as proof that the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty and its allies are a millstone around Spain’s neck, the latter that the Spanish Empire will endure, in one form or another. Perhaps both are right, in a way. Public opinion of the Lorraine-Avizes is no longer abysmal, but the liberals still feel emboldened in a way not seen since 1808. Seizing on the Crown’s moment of weakness, they have raised voices of protest across Spain, demanding the restoration of the Josephine Constitution. Reactionaries within the royal court are aghast at the notion, reminding the king that liberalism was what tore Spain apart during the dark days of the Peninsular War. Perhaps we could grant a revised and shortened version of it as a compromise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.A;We cannot dishonor the men who died for the royal cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN3.B;If it is the only way to prevent more fratricide…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.T;The Dumbfounded King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.D;King Alfonso XV had felt reassured when he declared that there would be no restoration of the Josephine Constitution. After all, he told himself, he had resisted the demands of the liberals, and ensured that the memory of all the loyal conservative soldiers who had died in the Peninsula War would not be sullied by his own actions. Alas, it seems that others are not so sensitive to matters of historical memory. Massive protests have erupted across the nation, as liberals take to the streets to demonstrate their outrage towards the king – even Madrid was not spared violent unrest. When the King ordered the military to restore order, the generals decided that the time had come for the King to abdicate. After a stern conversation with a roomful of stone-faced officers, King Alfonso signed a proclamation announcing his abdication and naming his young son Pedro as his heir, who shall reign as Pedro V. As the regency council announces sweeping democratic reforms, Alfonso bids farewell to Madrid and to Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN4.A;Well, I’ve always wanted to spend time in Paris…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.T;The Lisbon Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.D;The collapse of the Spanish Empire in the New World, after so much blood and treasure had been sacrificed, has been a disaster for the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty. Across Spain, liberals are denouncing the king and his court, calling for his immediate abdication. Some radicals have even go so far as to demand an end to the monarchy entirely! It is these extremists who have now acted. After several days of unrest in the city of Lisbon, the local military garrison attempted to come to the aid of the municipal government and restore order. This operation quickly collapsed, however, as soldiers began to be swayed by the liberals’ rhetoric and a mutiny scythed through their ranks. With soldiers defecting to the radicals, the city was soon overrun. All of Lisbon is now in the hands of these rebels, with famous author and jurist Teófilo Sales acclaimed as Provisional President of their Comitê de Segurança (Security Committee). This may be the burning wick which detonates the Spanish powderkeg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN5.A;This is a catastrophe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.T;The Toledo Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.D;With Lisbon occupied by militant liberals, a council of Spain’s most prominent military officers led by General Julio Segura has assembled in the city of Toledo. Declaring that the “current national situation” is “inimical to the continuation of the rule of law and public safety,” they have formed an “emergency council” to “protect the nation.” While they have ostensibly done this to prevent a radical revolution, many of them have publicly blamed King Alfonso XV for not being more diplomatic and provoking this crisis in the first place. §RIf the king refuses to work with the junta, they are likely to become his most dangerous enemy.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN6.A;Just who or what are they “protecting?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.T;Anarchy Looms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.D;The seizure of Lisbon by radical forces, and the declaration of the Toledo junta, has polarized the nation. The royal government is rapidly ceasing to be able to function, as revolutionary sentiment spreads across western Spain, while the military and its conservative allies consolidate their position in the east. We find ourselves in the middle, and the situation is grim. Though surrendering to Sales’ revolutionaries is unthinkable, the rhetoric of Segura’s junta is not encouraging, either. The situation is rapidly approaching a point of no return and we are going to have to decide whether to trust the military devil we know or the revolutionary devil we don’t.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN7.A;Between Scylla and Charybdis lies Hispania…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.T;In the Palace of the King;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.D;King Alfonso XV and his court have run out of time, and must now make a decision on which faction to throw their weight behind. It may still be possible to placate the revolutionaries by reviving the plan of some of the king’s more moderate advisors to revise and reduce the Josephine Constitution and publish the resulting document as a royal charter of rights. Doing so might redeem the king in the eyes of more gulli – er, less committed revolutionaries, and allow him to harness the movement against Segura’s junta. He could also do the reverse, issuing a unilateral order to the Junta to head west and destroy the revolution. While this would certainly be the simpler move, and the one which would preserve the most royal power, it rests on the assumption that the junta would not seize the opportunity to accumulate even more power for itself by executing a coup. What is the will of the king?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.A;Publishing a royal charter is our only hope – make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN8.B;Let’s give this unwashed mob a whiff of grapeshot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.T;The Lisbon Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.D;The proclamation of the limited royal charter of rights has failed to placate the revolutionaries. A counter-proclamation has recently been issued from Lisbon, the de facto capital of the revolutionary movement, which denounces the document as a “pale substitute of liberty” and “a dishonor to the Spanish people!” Sales’ so-called Comitê de Segurança has presented a demand on behalf of the Spanish revolutionary movement : reinstate the Josephine Constitution, in full and without any alterations, or face a new civil war. Reactionaries within the royal court are outraged at the liberals’ ingratitude, and even some moderate conservatives are angered that they would reject such generosity on behalf of the sovereign. It seems that King Alfonso must decide between destroying Spanish royal power or making war upon the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.A;Better a constitutional kingdom than no kingdom at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN9.B;The army will show these traitors the price of their impudence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.T;A Question of Capitals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.D;Now that the threat of civil war has been eliminated, a significant amount of wind has been taken out of the revolutionaries’ sails. Most of western Spain is now returning to law and order – most, but not all. The hardcore radicals have dug in within Lisbon, thought they are now reduced to demanding the return of the national capital to their city. They have made all sorts of arguments as to why this is necessary, which ultimately boil down to their fears of continued conservative domination if the capital remains in the east. Many conservatives have reacted with scorn to this proposal, sharply rebuking the liberals for daring to continue to make demands upon the sovereign after he has already graciously permitted such massive reforms. This may very well be the last significant decision which King Alfonso personally makes in his capacity as head of state. Shall the capital return to Lisbon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.A;No, why would we give the traitors another reward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN10.B;Yes, it will simplify matters in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.T;The Lisbon Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.D;When General Segura and the rest of the Toledo Junta learned of the liberals’ intransigence regarding the capital, even after the king had restored the Josephine Constitution, they decided to finally take action to root out the would-be revolutionaries. Marshalling their forces, they descended upon the city determined to destroy the radicals – and destroy they did. Hundreds of people were shot down in the streets, with the liberals totally outgunned by the army. Sales himself was tried by a military tribunal, convicted, and hanged in front of the Cathedral of Saint Mary Major. Lisbon has been recaptured, but the death toll is staggering. Many wonder if this blood-soaked affair is a sign of things to come in Spain’s fragile new democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN11.A;An inauspicious beginning, to be sure…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.T;The Coup of $GET_YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.D;When King Alfonso ordered Segura to take decisive action against the revolutionaries, he obeyed – in a way. Decisive action was taken, but not against the revolutionaries. Instead, the junta concluded that the greatest danger to Spain was not the rebels in Lisbon, but King Alfonso himself. Thus, they marched north to Madrid, their forces easily overwhelming the city garrison and reaching the royal palace. There they explained to Alfonso that he and the rest of the royal family were to immediately abdicate and depart for the Dual Monarchy. Alfonso attempted to protest, but the generals made it clear that they blamed him and his intransigence for creating the crisis and warned him that many revolutionaries would be angered at the notion of the Lorraine-Avizes leaving Spain alive. By ensuring his family’s safe exile, they were already being quite merciful. King Alfonso had no choice but to sign a pronouncement declaring his abdication, handing power over to the junta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN12.A;What shall they do with their newfound power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.T;The Spanish Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.D;When the Toledo Junta forced King Alfonso to abdicate, many feared that Segura would seize all power for himself and ignite a war with the revolutionaries in the west. These pessimists were astonished when, instead, the Junta proclaimed its “investment and entrusting of all sovereign power” in the Lisbon rebels! The Comitê de Segurança quickly convened an assembly of representatives to establish a new government. What emerged from this legal crucible was nothing less than a republic – a constitutional, democratic republic, the likes of which have not been seen since the tumult which preceded the Great German Wars. Crowned heads across Europe feel the growing shadow of an enemy they thought long dead, as republicanism rises from the ashes. A revolution has been carried out at the edge of Europe, but surely its influence shall soon be made manifest across the continent – including the energizing of its enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN13.A;Like the sun upon the sky, we greet the rising of the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.T;The Matter of the Fueros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.D;For centuries, Castile and other parts of Spain have enjoyed a complex system of separate legal codes under the name of the “fueros.” When the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty began to centralize more and more power towards the western coast of Spain, particularly around Lisbon, the fueros allowed the Castilians to resist their efforts and force the kings of Spain to accommodate to local realities. This system was brought crashing to the ground by King Jose II, who issued the Lisbon Proclamation in 1809 which destroyed the fueros in the name of modernizing Spanish law and administration. However, the victory of the Pedrists in the Peninsular War restored the fueros, and the Castilians have been using them to resist our attempts to centralize Spain. Our government is now considering whether to revive the Lisbon Proclamation and attempt once more to dismantle the fueros. Doing so would be a tremendous victory over the backwards, feudal nature of Spanish law, but would also outrage the Castilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.A;We must tear down this whole rotten system at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN14.B;Abolition would be far too dangerous at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.T;Spaniards in Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.D;Our fair capital is no stranger to famous guests, but the new arrivals shocked even the most jaded Parisians : King Alfonso XV of Spain, and most of the Lorraine-Aviz royal family! He has quickly contacted the royal court, where we have learned the details of his overthrow. Alfonso was quick to blame a sinister conspiracy between liberal extremists and traitorous army officers, who have now joined forces to seize Spain and proclaim a republic! Anglois reactionaries are apoplectic over the affair : Spain was one of our closest allies, not to mention a shining bastion of the Catholic faith. Its loss to the republican menace is a bitter blow to all of Europe. Now, many conservatives are demanding that we intervene in Spain to overthrow the liberals and reinstall Alfonso, like our forefathers liberated Spain from Jose II in the Peninsular War of 1808-1815. Of course, launching such a colossal war would destabilize Europe even further, and might invite our enemies to aid the Spanish Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.A;We shall destroy the revolution and save Spain like our forefathers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN15.B;A major European war would be horrendous, recognize the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.T;The Second Peninsular War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.D;For the second time in decades, the Dual Monarchy has declared war upon Spain, ostensibly its ally. It has done so as it did in 1808 : to destroy Spanish liberalism and restore a conservative to the throne. That they are doing so now to restore the recently ousted king, Alfonso XV, rather than a mere pretender, matters little to the Spanish people. They are now bracing for yet more carnage, with General Segura and the dashing young Major-General Francisco Aguirre leading Spain into battle. Yet while the Spanish people once fought in the name of a king of their own, now they are doing so for new reasons. If you asked the more intellectual among them, they would speak of liberalism, of republicanism, of democracy, of the consent of the governed. They would speak of the ways in which the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty has mired Spain in backwardness and repression, and how the Anglois have acted in concert with them. However, for the common Spanish citizen, the reason to fight is summed up in a single phrase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN16.A;¡No pasarán!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.T;Navarre Defies Us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.D;As part of our war effort against the illegitimate Spanish Republic, we had sent an envoy to Navarre to confirm that Anglois land and naval forces would be allowed passage through the country en route to Spain. This was expected to be a simple matter of transit, but it seems that the Navarrese have taken the opportunity to make some sort of absurd stand. Denouncing us as an “aggressive menace,” the Navarrese have refused to give our military passage! While much of the Anglois military is outraged by this affront, some members of the royal court have brought up the topic of the Plantagenet’s old claims to Navarre. This incident could give us the opportunity to “remind” the Navarrese of our claim, threatening to occupy and annex them if they do not obey us. §RWe should be cognizant that our neighbors, particularly Aragon, would be alarmed at such an ultimatum, and may take action to prevent us from conquering Navarre.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.A;We will not be bullied by a speck upon the map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN17.B;The mightiest nation in the world is above such pettiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.T;The Republic Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.D;Victory is ours! The Spanish Republic has endured the savage Anglois’ attempt to foist the Lorraine-Aviz back onto the Spanish throne, and the Plantagenets have been publicly humiliated by their failure. Outplanned by the wise General Segurra, and outfoxed by the clever Major-General Aguirre, they have been forced to recognize our government and disavow the Lorraine-Avizes. The world, which was shocked by our rise, has now been astonished by our prevailing over the Anglois menace : liberals throughout the world shall surely be inspired by our mighty example. The republic’s victory has won the trust of many Spaniards, who are now cautiously willing to have faith in Spain’s new democratic experiment. The monarchist cause lies in ruins as liberalism continues to advance, leading Spain into modernity. Perhaps the blood which we have spilled together as one people shall consecrate our efforts to reforge Spain into a free and united nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN18.A;Like Athens against Persia, democracy has defeated tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.T;L’humiliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.D;To the confoundment of the entire Anglois military, we have failed in our efforts to cast down the Spanish Republic. Due to our inability to defeat the liberal menace, the Lisbon regime has forced us to the negotiating table. In the resulting peace treaty, we have been forced to recognize them as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom of Spain, and publicly disavow Alfonso and the rest of the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty. The Lorraine-Avizes are already preparing to leave for Plantagenia, but for us there can be no flight into exile to flee from our failures. There is only an uncertain future, with a liberal republic at our doorstep…and its wretched example giving inspiration to legions of traitors and separatists in both England and Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN19.A;Merde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.T;A Catástrofe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.D;The republican dream has perished beneath the onslaught of Anglois shot and cannonade. The wicked alliance of Anglois and Spanish monarchists scythed through the countryside, butchering all who resisted them, before descending with rapine and slaughter upon Lisbon, brutally sacking the city. General Segurra was merely forced into retirement, but Major-General Aguirre was executed by the Anglois. Throughout the nation, anyone remotely associated with anti-republicanism has taken the opportunity to settle personal scores against any liberal, knowing that the occupiers would shield them. The result has been a cascade of violence and internecine warfare, as village after village attempts to purge itself of the “traitors” in its midst. The Dual Monarchy cares not for the carnage they have caused, only for the treaty by which the war was ended. Said treaty placed Alfonso back on the throne and confirmed the fueros, while transferring multiple colonies to Anglois rule as payment for their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN20.A;Os fortes fan o que queren e os débiles sofren o que deben.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.T;The Dual Monarchy Pursues Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.D;In order to prevent a conservative uprising, which may have occurred had King Alfonso and the Lorraine-Aviz family been executed (as some radicals wished), the Toledo Junta instead allowed them to go into exile in the Dual Monarchy. Many liberals feared that this would lead the Dual Monarchy to attempt to restore Alfonso to the Spanish throne. Thankfully, this has not occurred. An Anglois diplomatic envoy arrived in Lisbon today, bearing official documents which recognized the Spanish Republic as the legitimate successor to the Kingdom of Spain, and which formally opened diplomatic relations between our governments. It seems as though the “Anglois Menace,” so hated by radical republicans, will leave us be for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN21.A;The Anglois lion sleeps tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.T;The Future of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.D;In one way or another, Spain has been reunified – in theory. The aversion of civil war has only been the first step in the journey towards national healing. What is needed now is a comprehensive review of Spanish society, and the government’s role within it. Politicians and writers across the nation have begun fighting battles of words and ideas, each seeking to advance their own plans for the revival of Spanish fortunes. Whichever set of voices win out and make themselves heard above the din shall decide the fate of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN22.A;¡Adelante!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.T;The Decline and Fall of the Madrid Economy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.D;With Lisbon’s reinstatement as the Spanish capital, Madrid has seen its prospects plummet. Less than a century ago, Madrid was little more than a royal hunting lodge, an appendage of Toledo. It was only Pedro III’s efforts to move the capital eastwards and reject the coastal establishment, and the necessary reorienting of the bureaucracy, which drew any sort of prosperity to Madrid. Now that even this is gone, the city has suffered an abrupt economic decline. Every day, more people are leaving the city for good, moving to Lisbon or some other, more prominent city. Shops are closing by the dozen, merchants are deserting the city, and nearly all manifestations of foreign capital are vanishing. For those who remain – the Castilians who have called Madrid home for centuries – the sharp pain of the economic loss only compounds their bitterness, and their sense of being used by the uncaring elite of the coast. Some Castilians have even called for the easterners to “reclaim” Madrid as their own symbol…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN23.A;I never liked Madrid much, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.T;The Monopolization of Land in Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.D;Despite recent depredations upon the Spanish population, as well as substantial colonial migration in the days of the Empire, the lands of our nation have not wanted for lack of tenants – quite the opposite. Many communities can no longer acquire the land which they need to survive, dependent as they are upon a mostly rural lifestyle of farming and herding. A significant contributor to this problem is the vast amounts of land held by the Catholic Church. Centuries of pious Spaniards willing their lands to the Church, as well as the Church’s own efforts to consolidate holdings around its many monasteries, has led to the Church controlling an outsized percentage of land in Spain. The Church, obviously, does not pay taxes, which means that our treasury is also left wanting. The matter is beginning to rise to national debate, as liberals decry this “ecclesiastical hoarding,” and even pragmatic conservatives question if our arrangements with Rome may need alteration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN24.A;A solution will have to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.T;Nationalization of Church Land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.D;Many Spanish liberals have concluded that the simplest way to deal with the church land is to seize it. Leading anti-clerical jurists have made a strong case that there is in fact no law which forbids the Spanish government from nationalizing most Spanish lands held by the Catholic Church. The arguments for doing so are numerous. By seizing and then selling off the land to small landowners, we would cultivate the creation and growth of a Spanish middle class not confined to urban centers, and one which would use the land far more efficiently than the monasteries ever have – or so the liberals claim. The Spanish treasury would also greatly benefit from selling these lands off to future taxpayers, and the local aristocrats would be pleased at a chance to weaken the Church, their eternal rival. Conservatives are, of course, disturbed by the idea, but some concede that it may be financially necessary. Of course, if we go through with this, it is likely that the strongest protest will come from Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.A;Jesus lived among beggars, surely monks can as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN25.B;And consign our souls to Hell? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.T;Arrival of the Papal Legate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.D;News of the Spanish government’s imminent nationalization of church land has caused His Holiness the Pope to take action. A Papal legate has arrived in the capital, with an urgent message for our government. The Holy Father, he explains, is greatly unnerved at our plans to confiscate most Spanish ecclesiastical lands. Rather than immediately denounce us, however, the Pope wishes to arrange a meeting between himself and our top officials to attempt to come to some sort of agreement. While His Holiness would of course prefer that the matter of ecclesiastical confiscation was entirely dropped, he is aware of the dire state of Spanish finances. Thus, he might be willing to accept such a move if certain political concessions were made towards the Catholic Church in return. Doing so would be seen as a betrayal of liberal principles by some, but it could avert further political strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.A;Dismiss the legate, and enact the confiscations as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.B;We will attend a meeting in Rome for negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN26.C;This was a mistake, cancel the confiscations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.T;Quanta Cura;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.D;“When all restraints are removed by which men are kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to evil, propels them to ruin. Experience shows, even from earliest times, that cities renowned for wealth and splendor perished because of them becoming wholly overwhelmed and subsumed by the endless desire for further agglomeration. This impulse, this drive towards amassment not because of thrift and sagacity in pursuit of magnanimity, but as an end in and of itself, is born not from Almighty God, but from the false idols which His prophets righteously condemned.” /n /n In reaction to the Spanish ecclesiastical confiscations, the Pope has published a new encyclical, Quanta Cura (Condemning Current Errors). It is a withering criticism of our actions, equating secularism with greed and vanity. Catholic intellectuals across Europe have begun echoing his condemnations, to our detriment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN27.A;Surely nobody actually believes this drivel…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.T;An Audience with His Holiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.D;The most powerful and influential members of our government have met with the Holy Father in a secretive meeting in Rome, in order to discuss the issue of ecclesiastical confiscations. As the negotiations progressed, it became clear that the Pope was willing to allow them to occur, but only if we could provide some tangible demonstration that we did not intend to use them as the opening wedge to destroy Catholicism in Spain. Further discussion drifted towards one particular idea : enshrining Catholicism as the state religion. Though previously taken for granted, the status of the Church has been the subject of fierce debate lately. Such a vivid and permanent gesture on our part would go a long way towards allaying the Pope’s fears. Naturally, doing so would outrage and disgust most liberals, who have an extremely low opinion of the entire Church and would abhor making such a concession to obtain what was supposed to be a measure to greatly weaken its influence in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.A;Spain is a Catholic nation and we shall not deny it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN28.B;Try to concoct a maze of meaningless prose to satisfy him instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.T;Immortale Dei;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.D;”The Almighty has appointed the charge of the human race between two powers, the ecclesiastical and the civil, the one being set over Divine, and the other over human things, with each having their fixed limits. But just as it might come to pass that one and the same thing might belong to the jurisdiction and determination of both, therefore God, who foresees all things, and who is the author of these two powers, has marked out the course of each in right correlation to the other. Jesus Christ has Himself given command that what is Caesar's is to be rendered to Caesar, and that what belongs to God is to be rendered to God.” /n /n Our meeting with His Holiness the Pope ended badly. The Pope, upset by our attempts to outfox him, published an encyclical, Immortale Dei, condemning secularism and its encroachment upon the Church. While it does not call out our government explicitly many Catholics have interpreted it as a public statement of Papal displeasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN29.A;How ungrateful of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.T;The Spanish Concordat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.D;In a diplomatic coup which would go down in history if our negotiators had the freedom to speak their full minds on the matter, we have satisfied the Pope’s wishes without actually giving up anything of importance. A diplomatic agreement has been concluded between us and the Holy Father in which the role of the Catholic Church within several aspects of Spanish civil society has been reaffirmed. Nowhere in said document, however, have we stipulated that the Catholic Church is in any way bound to the state, or that the state is unquestionably obligated to support it. While Catholics across Europe hail the Concordat as a victory for the faithful, we know that it is in truth merely a way to keep the Pope at arms’ length from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN290.A;And His “Holiness” is none the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.T;The Ivrea Chronicles;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.D;Castilian historian Alberto González has published a controversial new book, “The Ivrea Chronicles.” Current scholarship holds that Spain was weak until the House of Lorraine-Aviz took the throne in the early fifteenth century and brought it glory. González has argued instead that the Castilian Ivreas, which ruled Castile-Leon (later Spain) from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, deserve the credit. It was Alfonso VII de Ivrea, he argues, who first claimed the title of “Emperor of Hispania,” and the Ivrea’s greatest rivals were the Portuguese. He then compares archaeological data of the standard of living in Spain, particularly in Castile, during the Ivrea and the Lorraine-Aviz eras. He argues that while the Ivreas maintained a good standard of living across Spain, the Lorraine-Aviz dynasty saw wealth drain away from the interior towards the coasts. The book intimates that the Portuguese usurped Spain to subordinate Castile’s resources for themselves. If we don’t censor this work soon, we may soon hear it quoted across Castile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN30.A;Censorship is illiberal, but in this case may be needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN31.T;The Asturian Trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN31.D;A recent incident in Asturias has demonstrated the which extent the fueros still influence our nation. Rafael Luis de Jovellanos, an Asturian and formerly the Spanish treasurer, was recently charged with embezzling the government, classified as treason in Spain, but successfully filed a change of venue from Lisbon to Oviedo. His reasoning was that he, a reactionary and former Alfonsista, would not receive a fair trial in “radical” Lisbon. This proved disastrous – Jovellanos was easily able to find a man to use the Asturian fueros to sabotage the prosecution. His defense attorney, Xuan Casona, employed shocking legal chicanery to win the case. After getting evidence thrown out since it was not collected according to Asturian laws, Casona was able to have Jovellanos acquitted since the death penalty, the punishment for treason in most of Spain, does not exist in Asturias. The whole case has made a mockery of Spanish law and has infuriated liberals, who see the entire Spanish judiciary as infected with reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN31.A;Why did the judge permit this travesty!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.T;The Matter of the Fueros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.D;The recent acquittal of former treasurer Rafael de Jovellanos due to loopholes in Asturian law has enraged much of western Spain. Liberals from Porto to Cadiz are apoplectic, infuriated that a few feudal laws and (they allege) corrupt connections were able to subvert Spanish justice. Many are demanding a retrial, but under the Asturian fueros, to try Jovellanos again for the same crime would be illegal. However, due to treason being a federal offense, the government could appeal the ruling and seek to bring the case to the Spanish Supreme Court. If Jovellanos were to then be convicted, said conviction could then be used to declare the fueros themselves contrary to national law. This would have colossal ramifications, but could inspire massive resistance from places like Asturias and Castile which have clung to the fueros for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.A;A retrial is clearly needed, but the fueros can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN32.B;The time has come to tear down the whole rotten system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.T;The Castilian Courts Suggest a Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.D;Jovellanos’ case, once brought to the Supreme Court, rapidly fell apart – the government was able to bring the full weight of its evidence to bear against him and secure a conviction of treason. He will soon wear the hangman’s necktie, but the Castilian courts were alarmed by the ways in which the Supreme Court’s verdict seemed to be an indictment of the fueros. Realizing that allowing such a statement by the Supreme Court to go unchallenged could enable the national government to destroy the fueros, some of the most famous Castilian jurists and legal scholars, led by Felipe Gullón Serrano, head of the University of Valladolid School of Law, have drafted a manifesto to the government. It suggests transforming the fueros into a modern form of structured autonomy, allowing regions like Asturias and Castile to keep certain rights while closing loopholes such as those employed by Jovellanos. Following this plan might curb separatism but would entrench the essence of the fueros within Spain’s laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN33.A;Discard the manifesto, and pass the bill ending the fueros!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Enraged by the unremitting centralism of Lisbon, these Castilian nationalists are pushing for unprecedented amounts of Castilian autonomy, with many demanding independence. §RThis is an existential threat to Spain.

SPAN35.T;The New Spanish Railway Network;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN35.D;With the development of locomotive technology in Spain, the government has convened a panel of engineers and scientists to determine the optimal layout of the new Spanish rail system. The most pressing issue is which region to prioritize. While the entire nation will hopefully be joined together by rail at some point in the future, our resources are limited and so we should consider which part of the nation would benefit the most from being the first to receive this new infrastructure. Most liberals feel that Lisbon, and the western coast in general, is the natural first step in the interconnection of Spain. This would bring even more prosperity and efficiency to an already developed region, but a vocal minority have pointed out that rail technology would be a great aid to the chronically neglected inland regions. This has proven a thorny topic, as those who have advocated for prioritizing the east have been accused of being Castilian nationalists plotting to undermine the rest of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN36.D;Castile has continued to chafe under Spanish rule. The rise of Castilian nationalism, and the desire to promote their cause, has led Castilian historian-turned-politician and author of the (in)famous “Ivrea Chronicles,” Alberto González, to form the Liga Castellana (Castilian League). This group seeks what they refer to as “home rule” for Castile, that is, a separate Castilian legislature apart from the main national legislature in $CAPITAL$. The Liga has avoided advocating immediate independence – at least for now – but they have heartily endorsed Castilian nationalism of all stripes, and their entrance into the mainstream political consciousness has in turn further spurred the ongoing Castilian cultural revival. Plays, books, and songs in the Castilian language have become symbols of the Liga, and González has even begun to give presentations on Castilian culture in foreign universities! If we do not solve the Castilian question soon then the Liga may become dangerously powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN36.A;It’ll never catch on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.T;El Generacion de Fenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.D;“Ten years ago, at the gate of Peñafiel Castle, my fellow Castilian patriots and I swore an oath that we would not rest until the reality of the Castilian nation was acknowledged. In those ten years, we have seen Castile reborn. Like the phoenix, she has risen from the ashes. And it brings me great pride and humility to acknowledge that, today, we already behold a new generation. It is a generation filled with ancient passion, who are Castilians first and foremost, and who will redeem Castile and lead it to glory. It is, in short, the Generation of Phoenixes.” - Alberto González /n /n The Liga Castellana celebrated its tenth anniversary today. The Liga has become enmeshed in both local and national politics and has already spawned many imitation organizations. Rising nationalism among Castilians has led González, the Liga’s founder, to dub the new Castilian generation the “Generation of Phoenixes.” The term is spreading amongst Castilian nationalists, who have by and large discarded autonomy and are demanding Castilian independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN37.A;Castile remains Spanish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.T;The Dynamite Outrages;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.D;Castilian nationalist groups have begun to militarize. While we have been able to break up the most publicly militant groups, others have gone underground to wage war from within the shadows. Yesterday, a large hatbox was found near front entrance of the Spanish Ministry of War shortly before lunchtime. When a pair of policemen went to inspect it, the box detonated. The resulting explosion blasted through the front wall of the building, killing both policemen as well as several clerks in the lobby. Had it detonated when the whole building was emptying out for the lunchtime rush, it would have killed hundreds more. This morning a letter was received by the national El Tribuno newspaper, in which a group known as “Los Falcatos” has claimed responsibility. Declaring the act “the first shot in the war for Castilian independence,” the note ominously states that “these attacks will continue until Castilian freedom is recognized.” In place of a signature, the note was signed with a pair of crossed swords…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN38.A;Murderous lunatics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.T;Formation of Acción Nacionale;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.D;For a decade, Spain has seen sporadic bombing attacks by Los Falcatos and other like-minded terrorist organizations, all in the furtherance of Castilian independence. At the same time, Castilian labor unions have been experiencing both government repression and alienation from more traditional, Spanish-dominated groups. Now, a new, militant Castilian “yellow socialist” labor organization has formed. This new group, known as Acción Nacionale (National Action), combines the revolutionary collectivist rhetoric of communist groups with a xenophobic stance on minorities and liberals. Acción Nacionale has proved popular in Castile, organizing its members into syndicates and representing workers. They have assumed political symbols, such as the “Castilian Phoenix” and the Jerusalem Cross (symbolizing their “crusader heritage”) and has even begun to organize “athletic groups” suspiciously similar to paramilitaries. Their aggressive, belligerent, and violent style has inflamed the Castilian crisis even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN39.A;What is this new and dark type of ideology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.T;The Castilian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.D;The victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoise is not yet complete. While we have mostly destroyed the enemies of the people in the west, in the east the old masters of capital have entrenched themselves amongst the hereditary reactionaries of Castile. Here, in this land of churches, manors, and aristocrats, the virulent strain of reaction has infected vast swaths of the region. Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the old fetters of society as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to delay the inevitable victory of the working class. Every day, loyal defenders of the proletariat report new acts of sabotage, wrecking, and other despicable treason against the people by this Castilian reactionary scum. It is corroding the entire machinery of the party, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN40.A;Death to all enemies of the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.T;The Castilian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.D;As we consolidate the National Movement, we must face its internal enemies. None of these are more prominent than the Castilians. For decades, these despicable parasites have feasted upon the wealth of the very nation which they scorn and dare to pretend is not their own. Their priests and lords fill the minds of their people with all manner of traitorous lies. Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the enemies of the people as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to prevent the final victory of the true sons and daughters of Spain. Every day, loyal defenders of Hispania report new crimes which bring dishonor to the Spanish people. It is becoming an epidemic, plaguing our whole national body, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN41.A;We must find a solution to this Castilian problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
SPAN42.T;Conservativism in the New Republican Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN42.D;With the abolition of the monarchy, new ideas of republicanism and secularism have gained national prominence. Predictably, the consolidation of the national government and culture under these new ideas has angered and frightened conservatives. They pine for the days of their fathers, of churches and crowns, and though this may sound like pathetic fantasy to some, they are still politically influential. Furthermore, the republican character of our new nation has disturbed the Castilians of the east, who note with growing alarm the ways in which we are dismantling the old monarchist regime. They are well aware that their unique codes and laws were inexorably tied to the crown : its loss places them in jeopardy. We have freed Spain from autocracy, but we must remain vigilant, for republics never want for lack of Catilines and Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN42.A;The light of liberty shall never be extinguished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.T;The Autonomy Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.D;A measure has recently come before the national legislature which seeks to address the increasing unrest in eastern Spain. Known as the “Autonomy Bill,” it would expand and empower regional governors across Castile. Proponents of the bill argue that it would allow the Castilians to exercise internal freedom without resorting to more drastic partitions of the nation, and that it would reduce the risk of autocratic measures being imposed unilaterally from Lisbon. Of course, most of western Spain is adamantly opposed to such a measure, with one Portuguese politician describing it as “drawing the diagram of cuts of meat upon the Spanish bull.” A few moderates have proposed to amend the bill to expire in a year and require renewal to continue, at which point we could simply allow it to lapse, but even this would be seen by the Castilians as a knife in the back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.A;Pass the bill as it is, we need a solution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN43.B;Pass the bill with the amendment, this is already dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.T;Castilian Nationalists Rally in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.D;The Autonomy Bill, even after its passage, has inflamed Castilian nationalists across Spain. Unsatisfied with the measure, which they deem a mere distraction from Castilian independence, they have converged on $CAPITAL$ to demonstrate the strength and popularity of their movement and put pressure on the government. From across the east, Castilian activists, politicians, and patriots have gathered in $CAPITAL$ in a massive display organized by multiple Castilian political organizations. The event energized their opposition as well, with many hecklers and counterdemonstrators arriving to denigrate the Castilians and show their Spanish patriotism. The resulting unrest and sensational news coverage has further invigorated the Castilian cause, and many unitarians are now calling for a nationwide crackdown on the Castilian nationalist movement to prevent it from growing out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN44.A;What we need are events to rally Spanish unity, not division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,	
SPAN44.B;Yes, let’s curtail this radicalism at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.T;Proliferation of Castilian Militias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.D;Castilian nationalist organizations have existed in the east for some time now, but they have now moved from activism to preparing for armed struggle. Government agents in the east have documented Castilian independentists attempting to acquire weaponry and even uniforms for various paramilitary groups. We have tried to disrupt them wherever possible, but the deteriorating state of law and order in eastern Spain has led to militias also appearing to “defend their communities.” It is difficult to distinguish between those which are forming to enforce the law and those which are forming to resist the national government. Most of these groups are local operations with little inter-coordination, and the larger ones are still competing with one another. If anybody managed to organize them all into a coherent fighting force, however, then they could pose an existential threat to Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN45.A;They are mere criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.T;The Toledo Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.D;The Castilian crisis is now reaching a fever pitch, and certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Enrique Almagro congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. There they announced that the “situation in Castile” could no longer be tolerated, and that they were “assuming authority in this time of extreme circumstances” to “take the necessary measures to defend the Castilian nation.” Rumors abound as to their intentions, but Spanish liberals all agree that this is a catastrophic development which likely signals the end of orderly democracy in Spain and the start of something different, dark, and brutal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN46.A;What has happened to our country?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.T;The Second Toledo Junta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.D;”In that sacred hour, so many years ago, a collection of honorable men came together to safeguard the rights of the people against both anarchy and despotism. Now, on that same hallowed ground, we shall make a new stand for our nation, our Castile.” – Pronouncement of the Second Toledo Junta /n /n The Castilian crisis is now reaching a fever pitch, and certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Enrique Almagro congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. Emulating the efforts of another clique of officers years ago, they have formed a new military council and have made fiery speeches extolling Castilian nationalism. Rumors abound as to their next moves but Spanish liberals all agree that the sundering of Spain is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN47.A;¡Não essa merda de novo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN470.T;Declaration of Castilian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN470.D;”To the people of Castile and to all the peoples of the world. Justice and the rights of man, irrevocable foundations which sustain the historical, legal, and institutional traditions of Castile, are the basis of the foundation of the Castilian Republic. The Castilian nation, its language and culture have a thousand years of history. For centuries, Castile has maintained and run its own institutions in complete self-governance…The founding of the Castilian Republic comes from the necessity to protect the freedom, culture, and honor of all the citizens of Castile and responds to the obstruction on the part of the Spanish State by exercising the right of the people to withdraw their consent from their government.” – Declaration of Castilian Independence /n /n The worst fears of western Spain have been realized : the Toledo Junta has declared the independence of Castile from Spain. The Spanish administration is being driven out of the east and our nation will soon be shattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN470.A;No declaration has taken place, because it is illegal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.T;The Toledo Diktat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.D;The Toledo Junta quickly marched on Madrid. The city’s defenders attempted to halt them, but many defected to the junta and resistance soon collapsed. The junta marched on the royal palace and presented the king with two ultimatums. First, they demanded that he abdicate and take the royal family with him into exile. Second, they demanded the independence of the Kingdom of Castile! The king capitulated and signed first the abdication and second the recognition of Castilian independence. Prominent Leonese-Castilian nobleman Buenaventura de Franco has been coronated King Buenaventura I and Alberto González made his Prime Minister. Bewilderment and outrage is the best description of western Spain’s reaction. Liberal politicians from across the west have gathered in Lisbon to declare the king’s recognition (but not his abdication) illegal and have formed the Spanish Republic with its capital in Lisbon, electing prominent politician Getúlio Salazar as its first president. The Spanish government is crumbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN48.A;And thus falls the House of Lorraine-Aviz…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.T;The Sundering of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.D;The collapse of the Spanish administration in the east has allowed the Castilian revolutionaries to consolidate their new government. Working with nationalist paramilitaries across the region, they have driven out Spanish bureaucrats and seized control of all the apparatuses and organs of government in the eastern provinces. This disaster is compounded by news that other nationalists in Asturias, Galicia, and even Granada may soon use this crisis to make their own bids for independence, plunging Spain even further into turmoil. The Moors must surely be cackling in their graves : just like the Cordoban caliphate which our ancient ancestors warred against, we too find ourselves divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.A;¡Viva Espanha! §B(Remain as Spain)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN49.B;¡Arriba Castilla! §B(Play as Castile)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN50.T;Consolidating Castile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN50.D;Now that we have seized our independence from the cruel Spaniards, we must organize our new nation. An emergency government has been formed to carry us through this time of crisis until we can establish peace. But for now, we must make ready ourselves to defend against the tyrants of Lisbon, who shall surely seek to enslave us once more. Even now, paramilitaries and militias are being reorganized into the new Castilian army, while the clergy preach the necessity of protecting the nation from its Portuguese oppressors. If we can survive these days of fire, then our names will burn brilliantly in the heavens forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN50.A;Command us, Castile, and united we will fight, so that you may live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN51.T;The Situation in Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN51.D;Granada has always been a diverse region, even after the Moriscos and Hebreros were expelled. Nowhere else in Spain have the languages and cultures of Portugal and Castile mixed so broadly. The “Kingdom of Granada” has been for most of its existence more of a legal concept and a feudal relic than any cultural rallying point. As a result, Granada has existed in something of an ideological twilight, uncertain of whether to lean towards the cosmopolitan cities of the western coast or the rural lands of the eastern interior. This divided identity has now become a matter of extreme importance, as reports come in of battles between pro-government and pro-Castilian militias across the region. If our loyalists triumph, Granada will be secure – if not, we will soon learn of their treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN51.A;They would never abandon us, surely…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN52.T;Massive Desertions in the Spanish Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN52.D;As Castile consolidates itself, and other regions of Spain fall into chaos, many units of the Spanish Land Army have disintegrated. Soldiers have abandoned their posts in droves, either to fight for an insurrectionary movement pretending to be a nation, or simply to return home and protect their communities from the violence. While we might be able to draw back some of the latter type of deserters in the long term, for now our military is in total disarray and we will have to accept that we must fight for Spain with little organization or cohesion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN52.A;Another cross to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN53.T;Granada Defects to Castile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN53.D;There has never been much of a Granadan nationalist movement, not in the way of other parts of Spain. It seems, however, that Granada’s dissatisfaction with the government has manifested all the same. Granadan militias were able to seize control of major cities, linking up with Castilian forces and driving out Spanish loyalists from the region. They have now petitioned for annexation by Castile, an offer which the illegitimate separatists have been all too happy to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN53.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.T;Asturias Declares Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.D;“Ours is a proud nation, which held out against the Moors when all the rest of Iberia was in darkness, and rallied the crusaders when the time came to drive out the Moors in the name of God. Now, as the scythe of tyranny once more sweeps over the land, we shall call upon our ancient fortitude and defend our fatherland.” – The Oviedo Proclamation /n /n Asturias is the region which feels the closest kinship with Castile. While Asturias has seen some prosperity along its northern coast, its inland regions share the feelings of neglect and cultural abuse which has animated the Castilians. Now, the Asturians have taken measures into their own hands. Following the Castilian example, a group of Asturian officers and politicians have convened in Oviedo to issue a declaration of independence. Asturian soldiers are already defecting to this new state and our control over the north has severely weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN54.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.T;Galicia Declares Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.D;“Ours is an ancient land, old even when the Romans first encountered her. Some have called us, ‘Little Portugal,’ but we are the slave of nobody! Galicia belongs only to herself. It was from us that Portugal arose. It is Spain, overtaken by Portugal, from which we now liberate ourselves.” -  The La Coruña Declaration /n /n Galicia is often thought of as a second Portugal, a place so close in culture to its southern counterpart that its unity could be taken for granted. This may have been so at the start of the century, but the situation has now changed. The growth of a nationalist movement seeking to romanticize and glorify a separate Galician history, language, and culture has harnessed the resentment which many Galicians feel towards Lisbon and the other cities of the south. A group of Galician officers and politicians have convened in La Coruña to issue a declaration of independence. Galician soldiers are already defecting to this new state and our control over the north has collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN55.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN56.T;Formation of the Guarda Nacional;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN56.D;To uphold law and order within the parts of Spain still under our control, we have formed an emergency paramilitary unit to assist local law enforcement. The Guarda Nacional will act to suppress separatist forces within our provinces, targeting enemy militias while our frontline units carry out the main struggle. The Guarda Nacional will answer directly to the head of government and his cabinet, for the sake of efficiency, and will possess broad powers of investigation and internal autonomy. Some question if the establishment of this group may harm civil liberties but given the sheer scale of the national emergency many are just happy to know that the government is taking decisive action against the threat of sabotage and infiltration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN56.A;May honor be their badge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN57.T;The Situation in Leon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,	
SPAN57.D;The old Kingdom of Leon was one of the first realms to be assimilated into the Kingdom of Portugal – or so many believed. Spanish has long been the language of prestige and administration within the region, but many rural inhabitants still speak the Asturleonese language of their forefathers, one deeply tied to Asturias, not Portugal. The growing nationalism among Spanish cultures in the recent decades has led to a revived interest in Leonese and in the virulent strain of politicized grievance espoused by the Castilians. Now, Leon proper has seen pitched fighting between loyalist and separatist militias. It is possible that Leon will remain in our hands, but it is also possible that the Castilians will be able to sway enough Leonese with the siren song of secession to secure the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN57.A;Do not forget us, Leon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN58.T;The Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN58.D;“Here lies half of Spain. It died of the other half.” - Mariano José de Larra /n /n Ever since the end of the succession war between the liberal Jose II and the reactionary Pedro III in 1815, Spain has been torn between liberalism and conservatism. That old divide has now become a confrontation between the Spanish identity, situated in the old lands of Portugal, and the identities of outlying cultural regions, led by Castile. At stake is not merely the unity of the nation, but questions of ideology, language, and religion. What is Spain, and who governs it? Is it a force of unity, or merely Portuguese oppression? New ideas of nationalism and separatism have entrenched themselves just as Spaniards, Castilians, Asturians, and Galicians are now entrenching themselves on the battlefield and preparing for the most horrific chapter in Spanish history. And as the world watches, yet another question arises : is this merely a dark episode in the story of Europe, or a sign of things to come for all nations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN58.A;Ask not for whom the bell tolls : It tolls for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which Iberia has never seen before, Spain has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, and the banners of the Castilians lie torn and discarded, we must now somehow become a nation again. Already our nation’s leading politicians are hard at work, drafting the settlement which they believe shall cement the Spain which has emerged from these horrors as one which shall stand the tests of time. We can only pray that they are correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN59.A;The sun rises once more upon España.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.T;El Estatuto de Autonomía;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to accommodate the different cultures and regions of our nation. This “Statue of Autonomy” has reorganized Spain into a collection of autonomous communities, each with their own legislatures and protections for their cultural and linguistic aspects. The Statue has also delineated the powers of the regional versus the national government, dividing their responsibilities. It is hoped that the Statue will allow the old system of the fueros to be superseded without trampling the cultural rights which caused so much bloodshed. The Castilians are grateful that we have not sought a victor’s peace with them, and separatism in the east has been dealt a tremendous blow. For the first time since 1808, Spain has been truly reunited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN60.A;Una España todas las personas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.T;Las Grandes Reformas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to restore national stability. While certain cultural and linguistic rights have been conceded to the historical lands of Castile, the central status of Lisbon within the nation has been confirmed. The document has not brough forth any colossal changes in Spanish governance but given that the nation’s wounds will take many years to heal, perhaps we are not in need of colossal change right now. The Castilians mourn for their lost nation but have accepted the hope of building a more equitable Spain alongside the westerners. For the first time since 1808, Spain is at peace within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN61.A;Una España, con libertad y justicia para todos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.T;O Decreto de Unificação;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.D;After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to finally unify the nation. Given that the existence of separate codes throughout the country has proven to be the source of endless strife and division, it has been decided to do away with all of them. A standardized curriculum will be imposed upon all Spanish schools, and all government business will be required to be conducted in “Modern Spanish,” the codified, official language of the nation. Symbols of separatism will be forbidden from public display, and the status of Lisbon as the sole source of legal authority within the nation has been enshrined. Asturians, Castilians, Galicians, and even Granadans have all reacted with anguish at the news, but thankfully the Guarda Nacional has annihilated most treasonous militias and only a few fragments survive. For the first time since 1808, Spain has a plan to achieve unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN62.A;¡A Espanha, indivisa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, we must now decide how we shall conclude a peace with the westerners. While most newspaper coverage has depicted all of Castile as being aflame with independentist sentiment, the reality is far more complex. Given that the Castilian economy would necessarily suffer if permanently decoupled from the west, many Castilian politicians have proposed that we force the westerners to reunify Spain on our terms. They suggest drafting an extremely decentralized constitution that would make Castile and the other regions of Spain practically independent. Of course, there are also a sizable amount of hardcore Castilian nationalists who will not accept anything less than immediate independence. How shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.A;Spain will be remade in our image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN63.B;Let Spain be consigned to history! §R(NOT RECOMMENDED)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN64.T;The Castilian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.D;Our defeat in the civil war has left the country devastated, but the Castilians will give us no time to rest. Their representatives have arrived in Lisbon and have presented an ultimatum. They demand that we adopt a new constitution enshrining extreme decentralization, which would make not only Castile, but Asturias, Galicia, and Granada nearly self-sovereign. Given the state of Spain, we have no hope of resisting them…but that does not mean that we must accept. There is an option – suggested by the most radical ministers – that we could resort to as a last-ditch effort to prevent Castilian domination : immediately recognize the independence of Asturias, Castile, Galicia, and Granada. §RThis would destroy Spain.§ None but the most rabid Portuguese supremacists are enthusiastic about this option, but if we wish to deny Castile its final victory then nothing less than extreme measures will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.A;For the sake of the empire, we must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN64.B;§RIf Portugal is going to Hell then we’re taking the rest of you with us! §;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.T;España Confederal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.D;After days of intense argument, the leading jurists of Granada, Asturias, Castile, and Galicia have emerged with a new legal framework to reorganize Spain. The document castrates the authority of the national government, reserving vast amounts of power to the “states of the Spanish Confederation.” Each state may decide its own laws on language, religion, and criminal codes. The land rights of local elites and the Catholic Church have been confirmed, and even the national army has been divided along regional lines, with each state in charge of soldiers from its community. The Castilians and other cultural communities see the document as the next best thing to independence, but already something ominous is stirring on the west coast. Something bitter, inspired by the victorious ideas of traditionalism, nationalism, and separatism. For the first time in centuries, people are speaking of a Portuguese identity separate from Spain – a Spain which now barely even exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN65.A;Una España?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.T;The End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.D;Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, Castile prepares to take its first steps onto the world stage as a free and independent nation. The brutal centralization espoused by the westerners over the years has radicalized many Castilians and attempts by moderates to propose reintegration under a highly decentralized system have foundered on the tidal wave of Castilian nationalism. In fact, nationalist and separatist sentiments are sweeping across western Iberia, and it seems as though Spain will soon cease to exist. We are not troubled, however – good riddance! May Castile’s future be one of peace, prosperity, unity, and most of all, no more Spaniards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN66.A;¡Ave Maria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.T;The Dissolution of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.D;The end of the Spanish Civil War may have brought peace to western Iberia, but unity has remained elusive. The differences between the western coast and the rest of the country proved irreconcilable. With Castile not reintegrating into the nation, Spain has lost most of its population at a stroke. Even the most fervent Spanish nationalists were forced to admit that the country could not continue to exist in such conditions. This morning the Spanish legislature convened for the final time in Lisbon and voted the nation of Spain out of existence, replacing it with a country which has not graced the maps of the world in centuries : Portugal. Former Spanish imperial possessions have been lost in the tumult, scooped up by foreign powers. A new day dawns over Iberia, one where the Spanish eagle is nowhere to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN67.A;Spain’s story may be over, but the story of her children is not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN68.T;The Collapse of the Spanish Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN68.D;Spain, the oldest and most steadfast ally of the Dual Monarchy, has ceased to exist. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. Conservatives throughout the Dual Monarchy are horrified, and a few particularly eccentric reactionaries have been seen in public wearing funereal black to “mourn the death of Hispania.” Nevertheless, as our government realigns itself to accommodate this new reality (and the copious refugees which have sought shelter within our nation), our colonial office has reminded us that it would be irresponsible to allow Spain’s former imperial possessions to collapse into anarchy. Due to our status as preeminent global maritime power, we have assumed Spain’s colonial burdens. Anglois soldiers have marched into formerly Spanish colonies and taken control of them for their own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN69.T;The Collapse of the Spanish Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN69.D;Spain, beacon of stability and civilizing power, has ceased to exist. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. Conservatives throughout our nation are shocked, and a few particularly eccentric politicians or other noteworthies have been seen in public wearing funereal black to “mourn the death of Hispania.” Nevertheless, as our government realigns itself to accommodate this new reality, our colonial office has reminded us that it would be irresponsible to allow Spain’s former imperial possessions to collapse into anarchy. Due to our status as preeminent global maritime power, we have assumed Spain’s colonial burdens. Our soldiers have marched into formerly Spanish colonies and taken control of them for their own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN70.D;It appears that Spain, our former overlord, has collapsed. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. In the resulting chaos, its imperial possessions have slipped from its grasp. The old machinery of Spanish oppression has thus disintegrated within our nation, and we are now the masters of our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN71.T;The Restoration of New Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN71.D;Following our total victory in the New World, the traitorous Columbian Alliance has been dismantled, its leading figures slated for trial for crimes against the Crown. A massive westward migration of bureaucracy and commerce is occurring as the old colonial system has been recreated and the Viceroyalty of New Spain restored. While this is a triumph for Spain, a country whose fortunes had otherwise been flagging as of late, a question has arisen as to whether we should take the opportunity to introduce some new reforms. Many have argued against this, saying that our victory in the New World has proven the liberals wrong and demonstrated that absolutism is the supreme form of government. Others, however, have asserted that if we do not seize upon this moment of royal popularity to solve some of the underlying structural problems which precipitated all of this in the first place, there is no reason that this crisis could not happen again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN72.D;The total defeat of the Columbian Alliance has allowed Spain to recreate the old Viceroyalty of New Spain. The lands of southern Arcadia once more fly the Lorraine-Aviz banner, and the Catholic priests in churches throughout the colony once more give praise to the King of Spain, the Most Holy Monarch. Yet the ideals of Columbia – independence, democracy, and personal liberty – can never truly be extinguished. The return of New Spain to the imperial fold may yet force its mother country to learn the ways of her daughter and respect her. For if she does not…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN73.T;New Spain in Peril;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN73.D;Ever since our triumph in the South Arcadian Revolt, we have maintained our hegemony within New Spain by virtue of three things : our cultural grandeur, our economic vitality, and our military might. Now that all three of these no longer hold the respect of the world, our influence within New Spain is dropping to dangerous levels. Every day, the colonial office receives new reports of Revolt-era flags being found in New Spaniard’s possession, or treasonous pamphlets advocating independence being discovered. Small but passionate protests have begun to occur across New Spain, demanding increased autonomy or even independence. §RIf we do not quickly recover the world’s esteem as a great nation then we may lose New Spain once more – permanently.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPAN74.T;Fin del Dominio;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SPAN74.D;Spain may have destroyed the Columbian Alliance in battle, but their ideas have remained, fueled by the unconquerable memories of those who value liberty, democracy, and independence. The decline of Spanish cultural, economic, and military power has all conspired to create the perfect climate for independentist sentiment to take root once again among the populace. After weeks of intensifying demonstrations against continued Spanish rule, the Viceregal government has collapsed. We have received word that the elderly Viceroy Velasco de Iturbide attempted to personally lead a cavalry charge against a mob of demonstrators in Mexico City, only to die of a heart attack in the saddle. News of this plunged the colony into chaos, and a provisional government led by the popular General Manuel Diaz has taken power. Diaz has wasted no time in declaring New Spain independent, signaling the total failure of any effort by Spain to solidify its grasp upon the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This document will reorganize the nation along federal lines, to provide for equality without obstructing legal and administrative matters. The most important component of this new constitution will be the “Estatuo del Autonomia,” the Statue of Autonomy, which will officially classify each major region of Spain as an autonomous community. Each community will possess its own legislature, and various powers such as setting state language laws and infrastructure funding will be reserved to them.

The first will be done in public : the promulgation of a truly unitarian constitution, one to centralize all power in Lisbon, along with a national curriculum and the codification of the “Modern Spanish” language. These measures will destroy the legal and cultural measures which the separatists seek to hide behind. The second, however, will be done in secret. This is the issuing of Directive Number One, distributed to sympathetic militias and paramilitary groups across Spain. Prominent separatist politicians, authors, and artists will be targeted for assassination, as will any military officer whose loyalties are suspect. By using groups not officially connected to the government for these operations, we will reduce the chance of detection. With these two documents, we will annihilate all traitors throughout Spain, and the criminals seeking to tear our nation apart shall at least receive their eternal reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Our success at unifying these diverse cultures has caused some political thinkers to propose that we seek to expand our goals to unifying the entire Iberian Peninsula. To do this – to unite with the Catalans and form the first truly unified Christian state in the region since the ancient Visigoths – would require us to exert tremendous influence over the eastern Iberian coast. But if the Catalans are weak enough, and if they have been forced to give up their Italian ambitions, then we might be able to bind east to west and realize the goals of pan-Iberianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

From the western shores to the eastern highlands, all the old Spanish lands are once more within our grasp. This time we shall not seek to crush our brothers and sisters beneath our heels, but instead seek a reasoned understanding with them. Spain will be reforged along federal lines, with each cultural region accorded their autonomies while remaining loyal to the national government.

Advances in communication technology make it possible to create the first overseas legislature in Cuba, giving the Cubans local autonomy within the Spanish Empire without surrendering the influence of the metropole in their affairs.

The escapades of notorious warlords Guillermo de Blanco and Antonio Rocafuerte are proof that New Granada urgently requires attention to preserve law and order. Thus, we will create a New Granadan legislature, and introduce economic reforms to increase New Granadan trade as a condition of their integration.

Advances in communication and transportation technology, however, may finally allow us to enmesh San Salvador’s rich lands with the international market. We will create a new Salvadoran legislature and introduce economic reforms to spur development.

PLA1.T;Of Master and Slave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA1.D;Plantagenia is a kingdom facing uncertain times. Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago, his young son Louis I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running, but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many Plantagenians feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in Plantagenia), the opposition of Queen-Regent Catherine de Valois-Medici to it, and the relations with native peoples are all putting pressure on Plantagenian society and its entrenched Planteur power structure. Furthermore, relations with the Belgian Confederacy, the Columbian Alliance, and the Scandinavian colonies are fraught with tensions over various border disputes. If Plantagenia is to escape the chains of the past and head into the future, someone will have to loosen her bonds…or break them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA2.T;The Great Storm of 1837;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA2.D;Nouvelle-Orleans is optimally situated in terms of commerce, the natural trade hub of the Carribbean and southern Arcadia, with a commanding position on the Mississippi River. Unfortunately, it is also quite vulnerable to hurricanes, the massive tropical storms which occasionally sweep into the Caribbean. Lying on a floodplain at the bottom of a coasetal valley, Nouvelle-Orleans’ surrounding environs are essentially a giant bowl : if the levies on the river fail, nothing stands in the way of its flooding. A few days ago, a giant storm made landfall on the coast. With little time to react, many Nouvelle-Orleaners were caught in the maelstrom of pounding rain and winds strong enough to embed splinters of wood in hardened cement! Our nation’s beautiful capital has been devastated, and it will take months for all the damage to be repaired. To say nothing of the lives lost…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA3.T;Apaches Raid Saint Sauveur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA3.D;The Apaches are an especially ferocious tribe living on the western plains. Though they are too decentralized to launch organized conquests like the Inca of Ameriga, they still possess the skill and coordination to conduct brutal attacks against the Plantagenian frontier. This morning we received word that another Apache assault had occurred in the town of Saint Sauveur. It came at dusk, just after the sun had set. Apache braves on horseback descended upon the town, picking off lone Plantagenians and brutalizing the settlers who attempted to defend the area. It was only the timely intervention of a local frontier patrol which prevented them from pillaging the whole town, though they still managed to escape. They inflicted severe damage and it will take months for Saint Sauveur to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA3.A;Damned savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA4.T;Saint Sauver Raided Again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA4.D;In an act of astonishing temerity, the Apache savages have attacked Saint Sauveur less than a month after their last incursion! This time, the raid came just before dawn. While most townspeople were still asleep, another horde of Apache braves rode straight into the town. Since the last raid, many townspeople had acquired weapons, and so were better prepared to fight. The result was street-by-street fighting between settlers and Apaches, and the reduced amount of looting was balanced out by the increased bloodshed across the town. The incident has animated westerners against the tribes of the frontier, and now western politicians are now calling on the government to take a stronger stance on the Apache threat and pacify the west. §RYet if we do so we would be moving away men and resources that might otherwise be allocated defending against the Belgians, who seek to reclaim their lost southern lands.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA5.D;Louis I has finally reached his age of majority. In an opulent ceremony filled with pomp and splendor, he was coronated King Louis I of Plantagenia by the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans. Louis may be a young king, but he must learn quickly. With his anti-slavery mother, Queen Catherine, no longer the head of state, various factions are beginning to emerge, seeking to influence him. Those who support or oppose slavery, those who seek war against the natives or against the Belgians, even those who desire an end to the monarchy…There are many who seek Louis as a pawn to be captured, and used against their rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA5.A;But Louis is a king, not a pawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA6.T;A Royal Visit to La Galette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA6.D;King Louis I has recently been touring his new domain, familiarizing himself with the land and its people, while building popular support for the monarchy. His recent stop in the growing town of La Galette, however, seems to have awakened something within the young monarch. While he had visited La Galette for the purpose of officially designating it as a royal city, he has been enraptured by this “Gateway to the West.” He spent quite a bit of time inspecting the outlands of the region, much to the shock of the locals, and even conducted some of his tours while riding on horseback. All in all, the frontier life seems to suit the “boy king” quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA6.A;How gauche!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA7.T;Lord of the Plains;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA7.D;Louis’ time in La Galette has affected him even more profoundly than had first been thought. In the weeks since the end of his national tour, he has made several trips out to the frontier, often upon his own horse! Frontier towns and settlements across the plains have become accustomed to the sight of the king riding into town, his entourage scrambling to follow. Louis particularly enjoyed engaging in buffalo hunts with royal Indian auxiliaries, to the point where his white minders were somewhat embarrassed by the familiar and fraternizing manner with which he treated them. Nouvelle-Orleans and the other cities of culture and refinement back west have been astonished by the king’s plebian activities, but he has befriended quite a few influential politicians and family patriarchs in the region. What’s more, the image of the dashing young “Roi-Vacher,” riding across the plains with the same attire and attitude as the other frontiersmen, is quickly winning the hearts of the people of northwestern Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA8.T;The Planteur Aristocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA8.D;Every monarchy has a noble class which must be managed, but the Plantagenian aristocracy wields tremendous power in comparison to the nobility of other nations. Hailing from English and French bloodlines of the highest pedigree, these men and women control enormous plantations employing hundreds of slaves. The conditions upon these fields are said by radical liberals to be utterly brutal, dominated by torture and violence. The Planteurs, however, swear up and down that they are the preservers of chivalry, tending to their slaves with the benevolence of a parent. As codified in the Second Charter of 1814, the censitary vote system weighs the impact of slaveowners according to their slaves even though the slaves themselves cannot vote. This means that the upper house is completely dominated by Planteur interests, and the lower house thoroughly influenced by them as well. Resentment is building against the Planteurs but at the moment their position is difficult to assail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA9.T;The Knight of Saint Georges;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA9.D;“It is not enough to say, ‘I am a man.’ I am a man of noble blood, white and black together, noble not despite my African heritage but BECAUSE of it. I feel no shame in being a mulatto because there is none. Is a mulatto not a man and a brother? Shall you weigh the hearts of all yellow men, bestowing rights upon one but not another, because of an insufficient quantity of European blood? If a man of European paternity and noble birth can be denied freedom, then no man in Plantagenia, not even the richest master of enslaved negros, is free.” /n /n Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges is a scion of a noble family which accompanied the Anglois Charles I to Arcadia. Unlike many mulattos he is technically legitimate as his father married his slave mother in secret. Sent to Europe for his studies, he fought for the liberals in the Hungarian Revolution. The existence of “yellow” (mulatto) nobles has long irritated the Planteurs but Sir Saint-Georges is now spreading ideas of racial equality unheard of in Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA9.A;All men were “created equal?” Sounds dangerous to me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA10.T;The Loi Jaune and its Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA10.D;Despite the best efforts of the Planteurs, the frequency of racial intermixture between whites and blacks has given rise to a class of “yellow” or mulatto peoples within Plantagenia. Their existence has proved vexing to the traditional racial dichotomy of European whites above and blacks and natives below. To maintain the Planteur power structure, the Loi Jaune, or “Yellow Law” has been on the books in Plantagenia for decades. The law sharply curtails the civil liberties of free mixed-race people, despite a notable amount of them physically appearing to be just as white as any Planteur. Many mulattos are now agitating for the repeal of the Loi Jaune, especially due to the influence of the Knight of Saint Georges, who has made the repeal of the law his first political priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA10.A;Could Plantagenia even survive a future without such protections?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA11.T;The Skraelingr Jesuits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA11.D;For centuries, the Sacred Order of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, or simply the Jesuits, has been carrying out missionary work among the tribes of the Great Lakes. Unlike many missionaries, the Jesuits immerse themselves in native cultures. They learn and speak their languages, adopt their ways, and live amongst them, to gain their trust and evangelize in ways that natives can understand. Many tribes have not been receptive, but the Jesuits have seen great success working with the southern Algonquins of the Southwestern Confederacy. They have converted many Indians to the Catholic faith, even if the Indians don’t always uphold the proper rites. Now, however, as tensions rise across Scandinavian Arcadia, some believe that the Skraelingr Confederacy may collapse. If that happens then the Jesuit networks could enable us to attempt to take control of the Southwestern Confederacy. §RDoing this, however, would divert resources being used to prepare for a potential war with the Belgians.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA12.T;Rebirth of the Fils de la Liberté;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA12.D;Decades ago, the Belgian Revolution saw the Belgian Confederacy break free from Plantagenian rule. Louisiane, the Atlantic coast of Plantagenia, joined them in their revolt, fomented by a revolutionary group known as the Fils de la Liberté or “Sons of Liberty.” In the years since our recovery of the region, Louisiane nationalism had receded, but never truly died. Now it seems to be resurgent. We have discovered that a second Fils de la Liberté organization has been formed, with some members believed to be the sons or grandsons of the original conspirators. Animated by the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars, the Fils are republicans who demand an end to the monarchy, to the concentration of power in the hands of the Nouvelle-France elite of central Plantagenia, and to the “Plantagenian occupation” of Louisianie. Drawing support from the small landowners in Louisiane, the group’s fusion of Louisianais nationalism and militant republicanism could jeopardize our stability and territorial integrity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA12.A;Damned rabble-rousers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA13.T;The King’s View;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA13.D;The rise of the Fils de la Liberté has caused King Louis I to question his role as monarch. Up until now, the Second Charter of 1814 has limited the Plantagenian king’s ability to directly influence politics. Drafted by those who endured the mad ambitions of Charles II’s bid to become Emperor of Arcadia, the Charter was intended as a compromise with the more liberal east coast. It confirms the king’s status as head of state but still remands significant powers to the legislature, along with codifying the individual rights to life and property of the average Plantagenian citizen. Yet, the King wonders, must these “rights to property” include slavery? Is that not a perversion of justice? Could opposing slavery break the stranglehold of Nouvelle-France? Though the Planteurs will abhor it, many monarchists believe that the time has come for the King to take a more active role in politics, and Louis is starting to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA13.A;It is time for Louis to stand up and make his voice heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA14.T;The Rosalie Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA14.D;“The maintenance of constant vigilance against the enemies of Our nation is Our firm commitment. We endeavor to defend Plantagenia with all Our power and know that Our subjects do the same. Yet as We consider the threats to Plantagenia, We see one rise above the rest, one internal rather than external. We believe that the Peculiar Institution degrades both the social and the productive power of our nation : it makes us serfs of moral prejudice. Rather than providing a sound foundation for the realm, it is a foundation of sand. It may beguile from a distance, but apply force to it, and it dissipates, and woe to the house which rests upon it. Shall we build our houses upon sand when our neighbors build their fortresses upon iron?” – King Louis I /n /n The King has recently made a shocking speech in Rosalie, in which he has suggested that slavery is both immoral and placing our financial and national security in jeopardy! The Planteurs are outraged, but the liberals and mulattoes have been energized..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA14.A;Slavery, a moral and national peril? An interesting notion…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA15.T;”Sic Semper Tyrannis”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA15.D;Louis’ recent denouncement of slavery has drawn severe criticism from the Planteur aristocracy. A recent pamphlet circulating in Nouvelle-Orleans and other nearby cities, “Sic Semper Tyrannis : On the Matter of Despotism and Liberty,” typifies this reaction. It is a scathing denouncement of the ways in which King Louis I is supposedly grasping for power, declaring him to be “the MAD DESPOT Charles the Second come once again upon the world to clench the nation in his mailed fist and CRUSH with all his Strength the vitality from its people!” The work equates Louis’ criticisms of slavery with a desire to destroy the Charter, eliminate civil liberties, and become an unchallenged autocrat. The pamphlet ends on an ominous note : “If we cannot find protection from the Crowned Heads which WE THE PEOPLE have charged to defend our lives and our property, then it may be necessary to WATER THE TREE OF LIBERTY WITH THE BLOOD OF TYRANTS.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA15.A;Ridiculous drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA16.T;Louis’ Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA16.D;Tensions regarding abolitionism and republicanism are reaching a fever pitch within Plantagenia. If the government does not address either movement, it may find itself overthrown. Louis and his council have held several meetings to address the situation and two solutions have arisen, both involving the use of the royal prerogative. The first would be the most direct : abolish slavery by royal decree. This would win Louis the loyalty of colored Plantagenians, including influential mulattos like Saint-Georges. It would also infuriate the Planteurs to the point that they could likely pass a law to abolish the monarchy on the grounds of what they would likely frame as Louis’ “gross overreach of power.” The other, less extreme option would be to issue a new royal charter to expand civil liberties, undermining the Planteurs’ power without challenging them head on. This would improve Louis’ opinion with the white middle class, the Louisianais especially, but would mean letting slavery go unchallenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA16.A;The time has come to end this vile enterprise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA16.B;We must work with the Louisianais for the sake of national unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA17.T;La Loi D'or;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA17.D;“Article 1 : From the date of this law, slavery is declared extinct in Plantagenia. Article 2 : All dispositions to the contrary are revoked.” /n /n King Louis I has signed into law the shortest and most significant bill in Plantagenian history. Drafted by his Minister of Justice, Jean de Beauregard, the “Declaration on the Extinction of Slavery in Plantagenia,” or simply the “Golden Law,” has immediately and unconditionally ended slavery in Plantagenia. Its proclamation has broken like a thunderstorm upon the country. Liberals are ecstatic, as are the men of color, but the Planteurs are beside themselves with fury. Many Planteurs are enraged at the notion of abolition, while others are shocked that the King has not even offered them financial compensation for their slaves. Rumors abound as to how they will react, but republicanism seems to be sweeping the upper classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA17.A;A nation redeemed…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA18.T;The End of the Plantagenian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA18.D;“Fellow citizens : The people and the armed forces, in perfect harmony of sentiment with our fellow-citizens, have just decreed the dethronement of the Royal dynasty, and consequently the extinction of the representative monarchical system of government. As an immediate result of this national revolution, of a character wholly patriotic, a provisional government has just been instituted, whose principal mission is to guarantee its citizens’ rights to liberty and property. Elections shall be held with all deliberate speed to compose the new Republican government.” – Proclamation of the Republic /n /n After Louis’s decree, the Planteurs finally gained the strength to undo him. In an emergency session of the legislature, two laws were passed : one annulling the Golden Law, and another abolishing the Plantagenian monarchy and establishing a republic. Planteur Marechal Pierre de Maurras has been sworn in as the republic’s new president, but it seems that the royal family has already fled…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA18.A;What has become of them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA19.T;Louis, the Cowboy King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA19.D;“Four score years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, one which has been long wandering in the wilderness. Now the time has come to bear the torch of liberty and the sword of justice into a land long darkened by the shadows of tyranny, that it might be brightened by our coming. Let all who stand with us have one determination : that our free destiny shall be made manifest by our striving—that our nation, under God, shall at last be liberated—and that government of all people, by all people, for all people, shall not perish from the earth!” – Declaration of La Galette /n /n Louis I was not about to take the Planteurs’ seizure of power lying down. He has withdrawn west to the frontier, where the “Roi-Vacher” is beloved, and declared the Kingdom of Oumessourita! Already he is rallying the frontier to his banner to destroy the “oligarchic insurrection.” Many soldiers are defecting to them, heading west to join the Lord of the Plains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA20.D;“We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal, and endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…Having been subjected to a litany of injustices, denied our dignity by a government which possesses neither the merit nor the right to govern, we take for ourselves the ancient freedoms of our forefathers and reclaim our honor.” – Declaration of Louisianais Independence /n /n As if the antics of “Le Roi-Vacher” were not enough, now we are also faced with an eastern insurrection! The small landowners of Louisiane, disowning Louis but also dreading the entrenchment of an “unchecked slaveocracy” or some such nonsense, have rallied under the leadership of a charismatic lowborn general named George Lafitte. Many soldiers are defecting to their odious liberal insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA20.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA21.T;A House Divided;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA21.D;“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I do not believe that this realm can permanently endure, half slave and half free. I do not believe that the house shall fall – I do not believe that the realm shall be dissolved – but I do believe that it shall cease to be divided. It must become all one thing, or all the other. Either the spirit of freedom shall anoint our body politic, or we shall all, regardless of color, be bound by the shackles of slavery.” – King Louis I /n /n It is over. All attempts at compromise, at reconciling the issues of abolitionism, regionalism, and democracy, have failed. This morning President Pierre de Maurras officially declared an insurrection to exist in the east and the west of Plantagenia, with the representatives from both Oumessourita and Louisiane having already withdrawn to their respective homelands. Nouvelle-France remains loyal, and the northern Indian lands have been placed under martial law, but a prairie wind and a coastal gale both blow hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA21.A;Three hurrahs for La République!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA22.T;A House Divided;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA22.D;“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I do not believe that this realm can permanently endure, half slave and half free.

Either the spirit of freedom shall anoint our body politic, or we shall all, regardless of color, be bound by the shackles of slavery.” – King Louis I /n /n It is over. All attempts at compromise, at bringing a peaceful end to Plantagenia’s political conflicts, have failed. This morning the insurrectionary Planteur clique officially declared King Louis I an outlaw and demanded his arrest for treason. Word has reached us that the small landowners of Louisianie have also risen in the east, denouncing both the King and the Planteurs. The plains remain loyal but an eastern wind blows hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA22.A;Let us fight to make men free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA23.T;Victory of the Loyalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA23.D;At last, the Planteurs and the Louisianais rebels have been vanquished! Louis I has returned to Nouvelle-Orleans in triumph, its treasonous tricolor banners now nowhere to be seen. The traitorous “Annulment Act” which sought to uphold slavery and destroy the monarchy has been declared illegal, the Kingdom restored, and abolition confirmed. In fact, one of the first tasks of the restored legislature has been to pass the “Law of Equality,” transforming Plantagenia even further. This new law enshrines equal protection under the law for Afro-Frankish people within Plantagenia, ensuring that Plantagenians of color will be properly defended by the government. Plantagenia has awoken from the nightmare of slavery and civil war into a new and more perfect nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA23.A;E pluribus unum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA24.T;The Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA24.D;Tensions amongst white Plantagenians, particularly between the upper classes of Nouvelle-France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders, are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion, monarchists have met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of Plantagenians. The new “Reform Act” is a sweeping expansion of Plantagenian voting and public assembly rights, including the end of censitary suffrage, critically weakening the Planteurs’ grip on political power. Projections for the next elections show significant losses for the Planteurs in places where they were traditionally able to exclude poorer whites from voting. Plantagenia may still be a land of master and slave, but the dawn of bourgeois civil society and middle class-driven politics appears to have come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA24.A;And thus begins the era of the common (white) man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA25.T;“Le Sens Commun”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA25.D;The enemies of the king in Louisanie appear to be growing bolder. A pamphlet is now circulating in the region which combines the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars with Louisianais nationalism. “Le Sens Commun,” or “Common Sense,” written by an anonymous author, the pamphlet is a denouncement of monarchism. It condemns many aspects of the Plantagenian government, such as hereditary rule of the king and the Planteurs, the legislature’s subordination to the aristocracy, and the general lack of accountability to the people. The pamphlet also points out passages in the Bible which can be construed to be arguments against monarchism. The work finished by taking stock of Louisianie’s resources and highlighting the ways in which they could be used in a revolutionary war against the Crown! “Le Sens Commun” is rapidly gaining readers across the east coast, a trend that will continue unless we address its criticisms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA25.A;”One honest man is worth more to society and God than every tyrant.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA26.T;The Exile of Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA26.D;When the soldiers who arrived at the royal palace were unable to locate the royal family, many feared they had withdrawn to the frontier to launch an insurrection. It is now clear that these fears were unfounded. The frontier was not nearly so pro-monarchist as had been believed, and it seems that even King Louis I recognized this. A letter has been found from Louis in which he explains that he has gone into exile along with his family, rather than cause further strife “in a nation which is so thoroughly animated against the principles of government which I represent.” While the Planteurs are jubilant, dark rumors are swirling that forces in both the eastern and western fringes of the nation may be conspiring against the new regime. If this is true then we must stand ready to defend our rights to life, liberty, and property!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA26.A;Vive la république!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA27.T;The Declaration of La Galette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA27.D;“When, in consequence of oligarchy and dictatorship on the part of the government, tyranny prevails, and civil society is made to dissolve, in such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable right of the people, enjoins them as a right and a sacred obligation to their posterity, to abolish such government, and create another in its stead. We therefore…do hereby resolve and declare, that our political connection with the Acadien nation has forever ended, and that the people of Oumessourita do constitute a free, sovereign, and independent republic.” – Declaration of Oumessouritan Independence /n /n The Oumessouritans of the frontier have always disdained the aristocracy of Nouvelle-France, but they were outraged when they heard that the Planteurs had driven the Orleanses from the nation to uphold slavery. Deeming Acadianie irreversibly compromised, they have declared independence and are preparing to defend themselves by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA27.A;Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom! §B(Play as Oumessourita)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA28.T;Saint-Georges’ Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA28.D;While we have been preparing to deal with the Oumessouritans, it appears that other intrigues are afoot. Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges has gathered a group of both black and white men and led an attack on the national arsenal at Tasralousa! According to several raiders captured during the incident, he had originally planned to take and hold the arsenal as a base of operations to incite slave revolts in the area but changed his plans after learning more about the facility and the local garrison. A few days ago, around two dozen rebels descended upon the armory, cut the telegraph lines, and detained a train which attempted to pass through the area. Word was spread among slaves in the region, who fled their bondage and rallied to join Saint-Georges. The influx of manpower allowed him to make his escape just as the Tasralousan militia arrived. The rogue knight now has hundreds of men and thousands of guns at his disposal, and Planteurs across the nation are horrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA28.A;Damn that madman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA29.T;The Plains Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA29.D;Interrogation of men captured from Saint-Georges’ raid has revealed that this attack was merely the first part of a plan to ignite a general insurrection of slaves across eastern Acadienie. If this is true, then we may soon find ourselves in a struggle for our way of life against the savage hordes of the bondsmen. Some are now suggesting that we should allow Oumessourita to go unmolested while we steel ourselves for the battle to come. Recognizing their independence would be a severe blow to Acadien national sovereignty, but the notion of fighting a two-front war with the vachers of the west and the slaves of the east is not a pleasant one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA29.A;If we must give up the plains to prevent destruction, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA29.B;Secession is illegal – period!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA30.T;We are Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA30.D;It seems that the Planteurs were even more cowardly than we had expected. Rather than challenge our independence, they have recognized us as the newest nation in Arcadia. Rumors allege this is due to the looming threat of a slave revolt in eastern Acadianie, but whatever the cause, Oumessourita may now forge its own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA30.A;Yeehaw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA31.T;The Plains War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA31.D;As expected, the Planteurs did not accept our newfound freedom. They have declared Oumessourita to be “the location of an existing insurrection” and have mustered their forces to attempt to subjugate us once more. They will fail! Across our new nation, men and women long hardened by life on the frontier are making ready to defend themselves against the decadent greed of Nouvelle-France. We shall be free men, as our fathers were, and sooner welcome death than live as the Planteurs’ slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA31.A;Rally ‘round the snake flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA32.T;Failure of the Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA32.D;Tensions amongst white Plantagenians, particularly between the upper classes of New France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders, are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion, monarchists had met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of white Plantagenians. Proposals included a massive expansion of voting rights for white men of all classes and the protection of the right to freedom of assembly. The loss of censitary suffrage, however, proved to be too radical for the legislature to stomach, and the bill was unceremoniously killed on the upper house floor. The Louisianais, and lower- and middle-class whites nationwide, are outraged at the Planteurs’ blatant quashing of democracy. Peaceful measures to curtail the Planteurs’ power seem doomed by their stranglehold on the legislature, and now even white citizens are calling for more forceful action to obtain their rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA32.A;Damned plebians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA33.T;The Liberty Battalions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA33.D;Rising national tension has caused an increased recruitment among local militias, but Sir Saint-Georges’ latest creation is another beast entirely. The baron has been gathering free men of color into what he calls his “Liberty Battalions,” non-governmental militias recruited from Saint-George’s home state of Alibamon. While he claims that they are merely devoted to protecting colored freemen against racist attacks, nearly all Planteurs are convinced otherwise. Rumors abound that they are spreading propaganda against the government and the Planteurs, and that these Battalions will form the core of an insurrectionary colored army. Recently, Alibamon Governor Armand Leclerc signed off on a warrant to arrest the baron for treason due to the militia’s formation, but he and many militia members seem to have gone underground. A manhunt is ongoing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA33.A;This is criminal activity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA34.T;Assault on Fort Tolouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA34.D;The traitorous Liberty Battalions have finally attacked! The blow fell upon Fort Toulouse, a coastal Alibamon bastion near the city of the same name. Early in the morning, a column of colored militia headed towards the front gates, carrying an unfamiliar flag. When asked to identify themselves and state their business, they declared that they were the “First Infantry Regiment of the Libérien Republic,” and demanded the surrender of the fort! The commander refused, causing the militia to lay siege. Unfortunately, the fort was intended to defend against coastal rather than land attacks, and the garrison was small due to no expected action. The Battalions were able to blast open a side entrance, whereupon their forces poured in, grabbed all the munitions they could carry, and departed. Fighting a rearguard action against the Alibamon militia as they left, they seem to have split up and dispersed somewhere west of Talahasi. Saint-Georges now has considerable amounts of weaponry and ammunition at his disposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA34.A;The spark to light the eastern powderkeg…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA35.T;Marroon Bands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA35.D;A terrifying rumor has whipped through Planteur society. It concerns the marroons, communities of slave descendants who fled their plantations and have made their own fortified towns in the wilderness near the mountains. The Liberty Battalions under the rogue mulatto Sir Saint-Georges are believed to have dispersed across the northeast, distributing weaponry to the marroons and recruiting them into their ranks. Armed groups of marroons have now been spotted venturing out of the forests, launching raids on plantations to rescue what slaves they can before melting back into the wilderness to escape retaliation. With attacks growing more frequent, the entirety of the east may soon plunge into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA35.A;This is a catastrophe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA36.T;The Libérien Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA36.D;For hundreds of years, the descendants of African slaves have endured toil and torture for their French masters across southeastern Arcadia. Though aspiring to freedom, only the lucky few could save themselves. Now, however, the moral arc of the universe appears to be curving towards the children of Africa, to their elevation and their old masters’ ruination. The efforts of radical mulattos like Sir Saint-Georges to arm slaves and marroons against the central government, combined with raids by enterprising abolitionists, has transformed into something never seen. What has occurred in the east, as the entire apparatus of the national government recoils westward, is not a slave revolt, not even a rebellion, but a revolution which has established an insurrectionary nation. Built and governed by Afro-Franks, for Afro-Franks, its advent has shaken white society across world. The Planteurs call it Hell and the Europeans call it anarchy but its new citizens call her by the name of their dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA37.T;Yellow Aristocrats Defect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA37.D;The consolidation of our revolution has given hope to men and women of color across the former slave labor camps which the vile “Planteur” enslavers dared to call “plantations.” While we have done our utmost to liberate the people, however, we have also been approached by those already free. Not just any ordinary free people of color, but the “jaune hommes,” the mulatto aristocrats who have begun to rise to prominence over the last few years. Having chafed for decades under oppressive and hypocritical “lois jaune,” they now seek to make a clean break with the Planteurs and join our revolution. The more suspicious revolutionaries are wary of embracing them, given their upper-class background – a half-black man is half-white, after all – but their wealth, education, and military experience would all be valuable assets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA37.A;Any man of color is our ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA37.B;Watch these “gentlemen” closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA38.T;The Chain of Command;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA38.D;As we prepare to march to war for the liberation of our people, questions have arisen regarding the composition of the new Libérien officer corps. Given the significant role of mulatto support in securing Libérie, our leader among them, many of them had expected to be placed in commanding roles. While it is unquestionable that they have more military experience than freed slaves, adopting such an overt preferential policy will rankle the sentiments of black men and has troubling implications given the egalitarian spirit in Libérien society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA38.A;Sir Saint-Georges leads and the mulattoes shall follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA38.B;Let all heirs of Africa rise through the ranks according to their merit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA39.T;Criticism of the Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA39.D;Sir Saint-Georges and his colleagues are not perfect, despite their supporters’ pretensions. This is a known fact in the abstract, but its consequences are causing political division amongst Libériens. His attempt to balance aristocratic tendencies with republican zeal, and his forceful, determined manner, has brought criticism. The actual complaints vary – that he and his leading men are hypocrites, autocrats, or too focused on war to attend to the needs of freedmen – but the critiques of our leader are escalating and growing more complex. There is a fear that allowing such sentiments to remain in the public sphere will sabotage the revolution and embolden its internal enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA39.A;We will not tolerate libel or slander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA39.B;Unfortunately, free men have the right to speak their minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.T;Caporalisme Agraire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA40.D;While the liberation of the plantations has furnished our army with a great number of new recruits, it has proved catastrophic for our infant economy. With Afro-Franks abandoning the fields in droves to take up arms against their old masters, there simply are not enough people willing to perform the labor necessary to keep our agricultural economy running, and we are facing an imminent financial crisis. A solution has now been proposed by certain…strong-willed commanders, based on small-scale operations which have already been successfully implemented in the field. Referred to as caporalisme agraire, or “agrarian militarism,” it involves detailing certain freemen with agricultural duty – often on the same plantations they once labored at - overseen by the Libérien military. Although the system would certain stabilize the economy, liberal revolutionaries decry the proposal as “slavery by another name and in a black guise.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA40.A;We need a solvent treasury, means be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA40.B;The sins of the past shall find no resurrection here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA41.T;The Libérien War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA41.D;Order has now completely broken down in the east. The slaves have joined forces with free people of color to create a revolutionary black state and threaten to destroy our society! There can be no negotiation, no compromise, no reasoning with these savage criminals! Either we shall annihilate them, or we will be annihilated – there are no other options. We shall enact a brutal revenge upon all of the fiends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA41.A;Death to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA42.T;Growing Tensions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA42.D;The revolutionary war against the Planteurs has been hard upon our people. All Libériens have make sacrifices in the name of victory, but that victory continues to elude us, and many are starting to ask dark questions about our future. Some believe that Saint-Georges was never qualified to lead us in the first place, that he is a vain glory-hound who has lost his touch for commanding armies. Others believe that the whites within our nation have sabotaged us, that they are aiding the enemy and even attacking our own troops to further the cause of slavery and white supremacy. Communities across Libérie are now expelling their white members…or removing them permanently. If we don’t turn our battlefield fortunes around then this state of agitation will only worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA42.A;Do not lose hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA43.T;Swamp Freemen join Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA43.D;The southern swamplands of the Athesian Peninsula, and the native tribes which dwell there, have for centuries vexed all attempts to conquer or subdue them. Neither the Dual Monarchy, nor Venice, nor Plantagenia could successfully colonize this wild and forbidding region and its hardy Indians. Instead, it has become a refuge for escaping slaves, whose marroon towns have come to make up a sizable amount of the Athesian population. With word of our revolution spreading, these men and women have now emerged to aid our righteous cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA43.A;Welcome home, brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA44.T;Nouvelle-Orleans Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA44.D;After ferocious fighting, both around and within the city, our forces have at last taken control of Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean. Unfortunately, most of the enemy government evacuated before we arrived, but its capture still marks a critical turning point in the war. The most immediate question is how we should advise the city garrison to conduct themselves. It is tempting to take this opportunity to enact vengeance upon the city and people who have for centuries been the beating, corrupted heart of Arcadian slavery, the origin point of our and our families’ generations of savage torture, labor, and misery. However, Nouvelle-Orleans is a famous city, especially in the Dual Monarchy. Vandalization of the city could make us the enemy of white regimes everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA45.D;Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean, has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Our defenders fought with noble resolve, but in the end, we were forced to withdraw after evacuating as many people as possible. Whites across the nation are anguished at the news of the city’s loss to the eastern hordes, and the suspect elements of our people have been emboldened to further resistance and aid of the rebellious slaves. The news that they seem to have acted with general restraint in their occupation is of little comfort, and many simply do not believe it is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA46.T;The Sacking of Nouvelle-Orleans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA46.D; Nouvelle-Orleans, the Pearl of the Caribbean, has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Our defenders fought with noble resolve, but in the end, we were forced to withdraw after evacuating as many people as possible. The brutes acted with wild abandon, dragging respectable citizens through the streets, looting every building they found, and setting fire to the royal palace and national legislature. Much of the city now lies in ruins. Refugees are pouring in, repeating hellish stories of barbaric atrocities perpetrated by the savage enemy. The only comfort we have in this evil time is that support of our cause abroad is now growing. Nouvelle-Orleans’ ravaging is front-page news from Lisbon to Warsaw, and the Dual Monarchy in particular is outraged by what many Anglois see as the ravishing of their political child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA46.A;$THISCOUNTRY$ faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA47.T;The Rape of a Virgin City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA47.D;For many Anglois, Nouvelle-Orleans, the capital of Plantagenia, has shone as a beacon of culture in the New World, seat of the aristocracy and the closest cultural kin to the grand cities of the Dual Monarchy. This has made recent events even more horrifying. Word has reached Europe that a massive slave revolt in eastern Plantagenia has coalesced into a revolution carried out under the banner of the “Libérien Republic.” It seems that the war against said rogues has now gone so badly for the Plantagenians that they had to abandon Nouvelle-Orleans. Upon taking over the city, the rebels laid waste to it. If even half of the stories of their actions in the city are true, then the Pearl of the Caribbean – the daughter of Paris – has been scourged and harrowed in ways which civilization cannot permit. Anglois patriots across the nation are filled with righteous fury towards these savages, and a bill to invade and put down the slave revolt is ready for passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA48.D;“We have rendered to these true cannibals war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. I have saved my country – I have redeemed our continent – I have avenged Arcadia. The avowal I make of it in the face of earth and heaven, constitutes my pride and my glory. Of what consequence to me is the opinion which contemporary and future generations will pronounce upon my conduct? I have performed my duty and I enjoy my own approbation - for me that is sufficient.” – President Louis La Fayette de Saint-Georges /n /n The long-awaited day of our liberation has come! The Planteurs were cast out of the east and have been utterly defeated. We have imposed a peace treaty upon them in which they have been forced to not only recognize Libérie but abolish slavery. Let imperialists and slavers tremble at our coming, for Africa’s heirs have at last arrived in the promised land of liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA48.A;Enfin libérés! Enfin libérés! Dieu soit loué, nous sommes enfin libres!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA49.T;Aftermath of the Libérien War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA49.D;In a sequence of events which has caused some to cease attending church and others to begin to do so, the Libériens have defeated us. Faced with the prospect of their carving a vast swath of destruction across the west, we had no choice but to accept the treaty which they imposed upon us. Not only have we been forced to recognize their independence, but, as a condition for ending their occupation of our lands, they have forced us to abolish slavery. The mood in the national legislature is grim, as, with Libérien soldiers stationed around the exterior of the building and Libérien General de Rochambeau himself watching from the back of the room, a ceremonial vote is held to ratify the abolition of slavery. Despite the procedure being a mere diplomatic pretense, it still only passes the floor by a single vote – yet pass it does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA49.A;Dieu nous a abandonné.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA50.T;The House Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA50.D;Louis I, King of Plantagenia, once called the kingdom a “house divided,” and though he forecast that it would cease to be divided, he doubted that it would fall. Yet fall it has. The Libériens have fended off all attempts to reconquer them and have forced the western government to recognize their independence. While the Planteurs struggle to maintain slavery amongst the Afro-Franks still within their grasp – a population growing restless and defiant, emboldened by Libérie’s triumph – it now falls to the Libériens to build a new nation upon the ruins of their torture and abuse. As the sun sets in the west, so it rises in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA50.A;Let freedom ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA51.T;Le Jour de Colère;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA51.D;The Great Revolt is over. It has met its end upon our bayonets, shot down on scores of battlefields. The banners of the rebels have been torn from their masts, and the east once more is in our hands. What has happened here will never be allowed to occur again. We will see to that. No order was given – none which shall ever see the light of day – but across the nation, certain events are playing out. The torching of Afro-Frank communities. The extrajudicial executions of rebels, suspected rebels, or supporters of rebels. The burning of seditious and treasonous literature. The indiscretion of soldiers, officers, or indeed any man who wishes to partake in certain unmentionable behaviors, with the vanquished. No newspaper will report these events – none which will ever be published abroad – but no white man or woman objects to them. On their minds is only one creed : slavery today, slavery tomorrow, slavery forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA51.A;“Dies iræ, dies illa, solvet sæclum in favilla.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA52.T;A New Day for Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA52.D;President Louis La Fayette de Saint-Georges has so little time these days. With the war over, he has thrown himself into the work of organizing the new nation. In a given day, he receives visitors from across Libérie : politicians, entrepreneurs, journalists, officers, artists, the list goes on. Furthermore, he makes frequent public speeches, often speaks on behalf of the dizzying number of new civil societies and is in high demand to be given tours and inspections of all sorts of military and civilian facilities. Add to that the burden of bureaucracy and wrangling the emerging Liberian political system, not just the legislature but his own party, and it’s a miracle that Saint-Georges finds any time to sleep. After a long day of campaigning for his party in Alibamon, he had returned home and was heading to dinner, when his second-in-command General Rochambeau approached him. He reached into his jacket, and produced…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA52.A;A pistol, and shot Saint-Georges dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA52.B;A friendly letter from famous Equinoxean author Frédéric Delgrès.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA53.T;A Democracy of Color;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA53.D;The martyrdom of President Saint-Georges has produced a public outcry, with people of all colors – white, black, and mulatto – rallying in support of their deceased leader. Tens of thousands attended his funeral in Fort Toulouse, with Saint-Georges first lying in state before being transported to and buried in his hometown of Mobile. The assassin, General de Rochambeau, will soon stand trial for murder. He claims that he was compelled to act by an aristocratic conspiracy, but the evidence of his claims is slim. As reporters from around the world travel to Libérie to cover the funeral and the trial, they are struck by the ways in which Libérie is emerging as a cohesive, democratic, black-ruled nation. Rather than tear the nation apart, the beloved Saint-Georges’ martyrdom has instead brought the nation together in mourning the greatest visionary of their age. It appears that Libérien democracy has passed its final test, and has received its father’s inheritance : liberty, equality, and fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA53.A;Au revoir, père. Nous vous rendrons fier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA54.T;The Georgian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA54.D;The mulatto aristocrats have announced that Saint-Georges was assassinated by Jean-Paul Blanchet, the son of a former Planteur. The slaying of Saint-Georges, our beloved father of the nation, by this vile bigot, has agonized Libérie. We were naïve in believing that democracy and republicanism would protect us from Libérie’s myriad foreign and domestic enemies. Therefore, it has been decided by the upper echelons of the political and military elite that a more robust and resilient system of government is necessary. General Rochambeau has been coronated as Emperor George I of the Georgian Empire, both named in the former President’s memory, and has created many wealthy or influential mulattos as new peers of the realm. The bill abolishing the dream of Saint-Georges, the Libérien Republic, passed the national legislature to thunderous applause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA54.A;For a safe and secure nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA55.T;Revelation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA55.D;“Have the whites not hung colored men by their feet, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars? Having flayed them with the lash, have they not cast them alive to be devoured by worms, or onto anthills, or lashed them to stakes in the swamp to be devoured by mosquitoes? Blacks and Yellows, whom the refined duplicity of Europeans has for a long time endeavored to divide, are now united and make but one family. It was necessary that our perfect reconciliation should be sealed with the blood of your butchers.” – Emperor George I /n/n The risk of further outrages by whites within Libérie is an unacceptable danger. As such Emperor George I has been convinced to order the extermination of all whites within our nation. As the Emperor tours the nation, whipping crowds into hateful frenzies with his stories of white atrocities, the rest of the world recoils from Libérie in horror – but now, at last, we will be free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA55.A;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA56.T;Continuation of Caporalisme Agraire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA56.D;The institution of caporalisme agraire was a necessary measure during the revolutionary war against the monstrous white enslavers – everyone in Libérie knows this. However, it has not merely proven to be a useful wartime policy but has enhanced Libérie’s productive capabilities beyond what most Libérien officials thought possible. Furthermore, many of the men whom George I has surrounded himself with own lands upon which it is practiced, and have an interest in preserving it. Therefore, it has been decided that certain residents of Libérie will be placed under the benevolent protection of the aristocracy and assist in keeping the Libérien economy strong. The formalization of this policy has disturbed more than a few Libériens, but the Emperor assures them that the nobles would never mistreat their kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA56.A;How does he know? Simple – they told him themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA57.T;The First Black Cardinal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA57.D;With Libérie’s newfound prominence as one of the most influential and powerful nations in Arcadia, international organizations which have long shunned blacks from their ranks are now finally being forced to end their racist behavior. Even the Catholic Church is not immune, as, during the last papal consistory (the annual gathering of the College of Cardinals to conduct Church business and create new cardinals), the Holy Father chose Libérien Bishop Elijah Fanon as the newest cardinal. The elevation of a black man to such a prestigious and influential role within the Church has shocked European Catholics but has been warmly received by Catholics of color across the world. Fanon’s elevation represents the truly global reach which Libérie now possesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA57.A;Recognition at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA58.T;Egyptology and Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA58.D;Saint-Georges University has announced its first international research project : an archaeological program in Egypt, led by Dr. Marceau Drue. Africa is a natural focus for Libérien historians, but Egypt holds particular significance for being possibly the most famous African civilization. The growth of the Egyptian cotton market and the increased foreign investment in the region has dovetailed with the rebirth of archaeology as a scientific discipline, sparking renewed international interest. However, many Libérien intellectuals are troubled by the overwhelming European bias in current Egyptology and believe they can perform a much more accurate assessment of Egypt’s past. The news has heightened an emerging Libérien fascination with ancient Egypt. As the researchers depart for north Africa, motifs of pyramids, pharaohs, and hieroglyphics are already beginning to emerge within popular Libérien culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA58.A;The time has come to reclaim our history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA59.T;The Rediscovery of Meroë, Napata, and Kush;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA59.D;While Libérien archaeologists are hard at work across Egypt, two discoveries in the southern Sudanese lands have energized our academic community. In this land, known to the ancients as Nubia, we have unearthed substantial evidence of a distinct and once-thriving civilization. The first discoveries were made at Meroë, a ruined city long neglected by European archaeologists in favor of more famous sites in Luxor. In Meroë, we have discovered many pyramids, palaces, and other ancient buildings believed to be thousands of years old! Relics and artifacts indicate a society skilled in early metalworking and artisanry. These discoveries have led Libérien archaeologists to other sites such as Napata, which have also yielded substantial bounties. This is strong evidence that all of Nubia was once ruled by the ancient Kingdom of Kush, and that the Kushites were wealthier and smarter than is commonly believed – news which has stunned Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA59.A;The lands of our ancestors…how thrilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA60.T;“They Were Kings : A Study on the Negro Pharaohs”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA60.D;Dr. Marceau Drue, famous Libérien Egyptologist, has collected and published his work in a new work of historical and archaeological analysis. Drue analyzes the history of the Nubians, who ruled the Kingdom of Kush millennia ago. While it has long been known that the Kushites were an independent kingdom often in conflict with Egypt, Drue has made the astounding announcement that there was a century in which the Kushites themselves ruled Egypt! As Drue explains, King Kashta Nimaatre of Kush installed his daughter as a powerful priestess in Upper Egypt around 800 BC, cementing his peaceful absorption of Upper (southern) Egypt. His successor conquered Lower (northern) Egypt and established a Kushite dynasty which ruled a land stretching from the Mediterranean to Meroë for a century. By comparing statues, sculptures, and paintings from the era with deciphered writing, he has offered significant proof that there were not simply ancient African kings and queens, but “pharaohs not dissimilar in appearance to modern Negroes.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA60.A;I KNEW it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA61.T;Le Hotep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA61.D;The Parti Jeune Afrik (Young Africa Party) has made waves for its pan-Africanism, but its new splinter group takes things even further. The “National Hotep Science Party,” or simply Le Hotep, was started as a “cultural activism movement” by Martin Duvalier. In its founding manifesto, “The Reawakening of Kush,” Duvalier proclaims that “all progress in the scientific, cultural, and political world…is traceable back to Africa and its descendants.” The manifesto, and Le Hotep, asserts that nearly every notable civilization in history was founded by Africans. Most people, however, are interested in their less academic aspects, such as dressing in uniforms patterned after ancient paintings and sculptures of Nubians, and in Le Hotep’s xenophobic anti-white rhetoric. The group has even staged demonstrations outside of museums which it deems to be “erasing African heritage.” Though many are confused by certain parts of Le Hotep’s doctrine, it is still rapidly gaining members across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA61.A;Will Libérie become the new Kemet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA62.T;Négritude;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA62.D;The emphasis of our intellectuals on refuting European ideas of white supremacy appears to be bearing fruit. A new generation of artists, writers, and scholars are fusing Blanquist political philosophy with Pan-African nationalism, along with radically modern reinterpretations of art and music. The resulting cultural movement, known as Négritude, or “Blackness,” has stirred a sense of ethnic and racial unity amongst people of color which transcends language and geography. Libériens of Frankish, Spanish, and Germanic cultural backgrounds are now celebrating their shared African heritage, supporting the usage of common creoles over European standards of languages, and using books, poems, and songs to expose the injustices of colonialism and racism. The movement is already making waves in Ameriga and southern Arcadia. This may be the start of a cultural revolution against European dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA62.A;“Pale yon lang se pran yon mond, yon kilti.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA63.T;Bishops in Absentia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA63.D;Our victory in the war of independence against the Plantagenian enslavers collapsed the structure of the Catholic Church in our lands. With the flight of the white bishops from their dioceses, and our lack of contact with the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans for obvious political reasons, their remains little ecclesiastical representation in Libérie. Add to this our lack of seminaries to educate new Catholic priests – and, indeed, our estrangement from Rome owing to the Holy Father’s displeasure at our actions – and the formal Catholic Church has virtually ceased to exist in our nation. Unfortunately, while Catholicism may have been the creed of our oppressors, many Libériens have adopted it over the years and are now distressed by the Church’s moribund status within Libérie. We have been scraping by through what few mulatto priests were ordained by the old Plantagenian regime, but so long as Rome is at odds with us, the religious situation of our country will remain uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA63.A;Is it too late to adopt Protestantism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA64.T;The Order of Saint Mark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA64.D;With the full reestablishment of our contact with Rome, a group of Libérien priests have received permission from the Pope to form a new monastic order of friars, the Order of Saint Mark. The choice of Saint Mark the Evangelist as their patron, while controversial due to the appropriation of Mark and the Marcean Lion by Venetian nationalists, was defended in an open letter published by the Order’s new leader, Friar Samuel Verne. Saint Mark, he explains, “not only represents the new evangelization of Libérie, but is the father of African Christianity.” Mark’s medieval depiction as freeing Christian slaves from the Muslims, and his manner of martyrdom (lynched and dragged through the streets by Alexandrine pagans), have also resonated with Libériens. The Order intends to spearhead the restoration of Catholicism within Libérie, reestablishing it both as an institution and as a part of ordinary Libérien life. Many hope to continue their work in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA64.A;“Caelum et terra transibunt, verba autem Mea non transibunt.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA65.T;The Black Fathers of Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA65.D;Christian missionary work in Africa continues to increase, but the white missionaries of Europe and Arcadia shall soon be joined by holy men of our own. The Missionarii Africae (Missionaries of Africa), commonly known as the Black Fathers (both due to their race and the black tunics they wear), are a new Roman Catholic society of apostolic life. Borrowing from the Jesuits, Black Fathers are expected to speak the same languages, eat the same food, and wear the same clothes as the community around their missions in the hopes of increasing their conversions. Their views about trying to leave aspects of indigenous culture intact, rather than end “savage customs,” as most white missionaries aspire to do, puts them at odds with many missionaries operating in Africa. The Black Fathers are not troubled by this – they see it as a sign of their righteousness, and many Libériens agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA65.A;Spread the word!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA66.T;La Société Abolitionniste Internationale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA66.D;For centuries, Africa has been plundered and mutilated, her children ripped away to be sold into slavery. That evil institution may slowly be dying out but any measure to hasten its end is welcome. A new organization has been founded in Libérie to support, advocate, and coordinate an effort to end slavery around the world. The Société Abolitionniste Internationale, or “International Abolitionist Society,” seeks to bring an end to bondage as an institution, not simply of black people in the New World but in every country. The organization has received the support of many Arcadian, Amerigan, and European liberals, from political parties to missionary organizations of various Christian sects. By organizing activism across lines of race, language, religion, gender, and geography, they seek to build public support in nations which still practice slavery to bring about its extinction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Its agents have now begun to publicize the plight of our own nation’s slaves, calling international attention to our use of slavery and demanding its end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLA67.A;But we are benevolent masters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.T;The Libérien Population Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.D;Ever since the establishment of African chattel slavery in Arcadia, many black families dreaded being separated from their children by their brutal white enslavers, and thus tried to avoid having more children than was necessary. Now, however, our people have been liberated from the vile torture labor regime, and so popular attitudes have shifted in the other direction. Without the threat of seeing their children sold off, families across Libérie feel far less anxious about having children. New economic pressures are also driving a population expansion, as are developments in agricultural technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.A;Another sign of our new freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.T;Islam in Libérie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.D;The emergence of “Egyptomania” in Libérie has concerned some intellectuals. They worry that the fascination with ancient Egypt is erasing the Islamic identity of northern Africa just as Europeans do. While many African slaves lost their Muslim identity over the course of generations, some are rediscovering their heritage as they trace their genealogies, while others seek to connect with Muslim immigrants. Now, a group of intellectuals led by Amadou Mohammed Keïta – a historian formerly known as Louis Boulanger, who claims descent from the Munsas of Mali – have published the “Mauresque Manifesto,” in which they assert the continuity of the “Moslem character and spirit animating Africa without guilt.” Their efforts to counteract Christian depictions of Muslims as cruel and alien, emphasizing Islam’s contributions to culture and learning, have created a new phenomenon: “Le Maurisme,” the introduction of elements of Islam into Libérien popular culture. Libériens are not converting to Islam but its surface aspects are entering the media.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA68.A;Salaam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.T;L’Ummah Mauresque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA69.D;Maurisme has been criticized by some Christian activists and artists, who among other objections accuse Islam of endorsing slavery. Many Libériens have dabbled in Muslim symbolism, but few have seriously advocated it. Now a new group claims to defend the rights of Libérien Muslims. Calling itself L’Ummah Mauresque, or “the Moorish Ummah,” they espouse unusual beliefs. In addition to more common aspects of Sufism, they say that “Mauresque Libériens” descend from Maghrebi Muslims and that the Mali Empire discovered Ameriga in 1311 AD. While the group’s esoteric theology has drawn criticism, L’Ummah Mauresque has also been praised for its support of zakat, the Islamic concept of charity, operating homeless shelters and raising funds for community projects. The group has met severe opposition from reactionary Catholics, and from Le Hotep, which denounces them as “enslavers” and “Semitic oppressors.” In response, L’Ummah has formed the Fedayeen paramilitary group to defend itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA71.T;Plantagenian Despair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA71.D;Our brave Armee has been completely and utterly routed by the unified and numerous Septiman National Army. Our confidence in our troops seems to have been misplaced. Bitter arguments have ensued between the King, the Nobility, and Parliament about who is to blame for these fundamental failures in our military that have left the army routed from the Eastern front in its entirety. Whoever's fault it may be, the result is the same. The Belgian Confederacy has taken full control of our Louisiane territory, Oumessourita has declared unilateral independence from this shocking news, and even our Cherokee Protectorate has recognized our utter failure and silently abandoned us. The Plantagenian dream dies today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA71.A;There is a deep sadness that will not wash away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.T;The Root Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.D;Deep within the most inner chambers of government, a sharp divide has taken place. The Western abolitionists in Oumessourita and the Eastern Landowners in Lousiane both blame each other for the loss of the war. It was thought initially that the quest to reclaim this province would be an easy one. This was not to be, our armies were barely able to prevent being completely ejected from our key defenses in Louisiane. The greater Sancomie area however has been thoroughly occupied by Septiman forces. Much to the anger and shock of the citizenry, the King has signed a peace with the Belgian Confederacy, ceding the province in its entirety to be annexed as the Seventh Belgian Republic. The division between the two, abolitionist and Planteur, following this defeat has ballooned and been incorporated into the larger age-old debate on slavery. With the loss of one of our most profitable slave states, some in the Western territories have argued for the outright abolition of slavery, in order to properly reform the nation from our defeat and join the more civilized nations of Europe, the Confederacy, and Vinland. It seems we will have to come to a decision on this, one way or the other, less we let our nation come to a complete collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA72.A;A house divided itself cannot stand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.T;The Devil's in the Details;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.D;The King's hand has been forced. No longer will he be able to delay or make excuses for himself. The two sides that have formed after our defeat in Sancomie have both demanded to know which side he will lend his support to. The Western abolitionists in Oumessourita or the Landowners in Lousiane? Whichever side we do not choose, they will surely take this as treason and declare their independence from us. This is a dark day for Plantagenian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.A;The King stands with the abolitionists! Liberty and equality for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA73.B;Slavery is the lifeblood of the Kingdom, the King has backed Lousiane!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.T;A Dream Lost and Forgotten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.D;The Septiman forces quickly and without much fight have forced our army from the Sancomie area. King Louis' forces were routed quicker than any of our advisors or generals expected or feared in their worse imaginations. We have been forced to quickly sue for peace, less our entire nation face collapse due to the numerous and superior Septiman National Army. This peace did not however save the Kingdom, much to the King’s horror. The utter defeat of the Army has shattered the confidence of any supporting region or state in the Kingdom, and they have all declared independence. The King is without support or even recognition anymore as a legitimate sovereign. With no army to face these traitors and no funds to raise another, it is a hopeless situation for the Kingdom. Plantagenia has ceased to exist following ex-King Louis’ flight to the break-away region of Oumessourita. God save the Cadien people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA74.A;May the stars carry our sadness away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.T;Keep Calm and Carry On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.D;Brave and gallant, the forces of Plantegenia have fought fiercely against a numerically superior foe and brought the war to a standstill near the borders of Sancomie. Though we still have suffered a defeat of some magnitude, with Sancomie being ceded to the Belgian Confederacy, the King and his allies have managed to keep the peace throughout the Kingdom. Constantin Leclère, the powerful and charismatic general responsible for holding the Septiman army at the Sancomie border, in particular, has been key to the national stabilization following the war. His power and influence have grown considerably since then, as the King was 'made aware’ of the reality of how close the Kingdom was to collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA75.A;A man who would do anything for Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.T;Louis Enters The Fray;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.D;King Louis has made a surprising move in recent months. Seemingly stepping away from his previous stance of neutrality and silence in regards to the questions facing the Kingdom politically or socially. He has stressed the need for understanding in this age of change and renewed thought. And although he has yet to confidently state it without subtlety, most recognize the King is in favor of a move towards the abolition of slavery itself. Much to the shock and dismay of the Planteurs in Louisiane, who believed the King's silence on these affairs was tacit support for their slave states. Some rumors have alleged that Constanntin Leclère, the influential military general of the armed forces, has put intense pressure on the King to pick a side in the debate, lest the divide swallow the Kingdom whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA76.A;A King who values freedom above prosperity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA77.T;The Protectorate Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLA77.D;Treason! Our Native Cherokee Protectorate has declared complete independence from us during our time of unabated crisis. Our limited supporters within the region have been exiled from power or even killed by those favoring an independent native state. This newly independent state has importantly chosen to not directly confront us to claim their freedom, instead offering neutrality or detente while we face potential ruin around every corner. With our armed forces completely overwhelmed on every other front, the opportunity to reintegrate these unruly natives back into our authority seems to grow slimmer with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA77.A;Blood alone can pay the price for freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.T;They Had A Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.D;Perhaps for now this situation is for the best. With the abolition of the monarchy, we face civil war and the complete divide of traditional Plantagenian society. For now, it seems that never again will these sides see eye-to-eye and there is little hope of reconciliation even after one side spills enough blood to claim victory. With this utter abolishment of Plantagenian thought and society, Arcadia is seen as a foregone conclusion of doom and despair. For if the Plantegenians themselves could not even come to a compromise, what hope would there be for societal peace with the Septimans? No... the Arcadian dream is for now smashed to pieces, seemingly to never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA78.A;Wipe your tears, it is a new day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA79.T;A Kingdom Decapitated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA79.D;Disaster has struck the Kingdom of Plantegenia. Without the Capital of New Orleans in our possession, our claim to the Kingdom is defunct and without traditional legitimacy. Our support from influential elites or the Nobility that confirmed our rule have either fled, betrayed us, or been killed. Along with all of this, vast tracts of land have been taken by foreign adversaries. With the Kingdom facing complete disintegration in the light of these realities, Oumessourita has been declared the successor to the Kingdom. May God save the Cadiens who have survived this ordeal. With these events taking place, the dream of Arcadia of but a distant memory. Never again will the Cadiens, be they abolitionist or Planteur, white or colored, dream of unification. The past is dead and buried, let it rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLA79.A;All who have died are equal, now and forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.T;Triumph of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.D;A disaster has been averted. The attempted slaveocracy in Planteur controlled territory has been taken by root and stem, and destroyed for all time. The rebellious Oumessourita has similarly been curtailed. This is a vital light in the darkness for the people of Plantagenia, we must bind the wounds of the people, society, and culture. For a better tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA230.A;Wounded and battered, never defeated, we stand victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA231.T;Planteur Will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA231.D;No more will abolitionists head and subvert our government. No more will the Planteur clique snake and wither their way towards the nation's destruction. Stability and states rights have come to Plantangeia since the first time King Louis rose to the throne. With the balance of power among Plantagenians lying forever shattered, it seems as the Pan-Arcadian dream died with the abolitionists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA490.T;The King Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA490.D;Plantagenia burns with the past destruction between Plantagenia and Libérie, the war has caused much devastation and widespread terror. However, a hope lies to the West. Within the Western Government that is Oumessourita, there rests a sect of the liberal clique that are still ardent supporters of the monarchy. However, there has been no Monarch for this faction to rally around. This has changed in the last few days. King Louis has come unannounced, with little support from any foreign source, and no protection. He has met with the Government and the various generals, advisors, and administrators of the Nation. He has fiercely advocated that the only hope for our continued survival is the reconquest of the Plantagenian state and the destruction of both the Afro-Arcadian state of Libérie and the corrupt and ruinous Planteur clique. Without this war, Oumessourita will be doomed in time to fall to either the Plantagenians or Libérie, with them threatening the entire region and all Cadiens. The Liberal clique loyal to the King has taken this opportunity to throw their support to Louis, and it seems his words have had merit with the military as well. Should we pursue this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLA491.T;The Grand Restoration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA491.D;Victory! Our armies, full of spirit and will, have smashed the Planteurs military , in glorious combat. Louis I himself was on the field, commanding troops and raising morale. The Planteur clique's leadership in particular have been focused upon and have been exiled and their adminstration purged. The hope of the government and people is that never again will they be threatened by an uprising of such scale or brutality.'These wars have only shown to strengthen the will of the Plantegenian people', Louis argues to a crowd in New Orleans, 'Never again shall we repeat the mistakes of the past. We must push for an equal society, a fair society, an Arcadian society!'. The government is split on whether to accecpt the current wave of popular support and return to the Monarchy or to abandon Louis in favor of a more representative government. It is likely that the decision to restore the Monarchy will only strengthen the present undercurrent of fervor to press on towards Libérie, for the salvation of all Cadiens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA80.T;Bureau des Nations autochtones : le code Tsalagi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA80.D;Our Protectorate near the Appalachian mountains maintains and governs the remnants of the native populations that were quickly subjugated and destroyed following the early colonization of Arcadia. Although the Cherokee Protecorate comprises the vast majority of the native population within our state, there are still those that live and work in our own territory. The Bureau des Nations autochtones was created to manage these inhabitants, having complete authority over the day-to-day governance of the native population in Arcadia, with the BNA establishing their own court system for trials concerning Natives. That is not to say that these people are treated with any notion or resemblance of respect or kindness, the native population is frequently and harshly discriminated against. In job opportunities, they are overlooked or outright banned from applying. Homeownership is a pipe dream and their interactions with regular citizens are met with disdain and disgust. Outside of the Protectorate, they are seen as more than a slave but less than a free man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA80.A;All according to their station, their status, their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA81.T;The Chaouénons rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA81.D;A genuine crisis has emerged from the Ohio valley. Settlers there had been taking up residence and establishing new towns for the continuation of the Southern Belt Plan to develop and colonize the local area. This project has come to a quick and shockingly brutal end. A Shawnee warrior named Lame-de-Mais took control of a local tribe and incited them to rebel against any 'European settlers'. They made quick work of the hastily prepared village militia, the settlers did not expect to be facing such fierce and bloodthirsty resistance in lands so close to modern civilization. The response from our armed forces has been swift in their retribution, burning villages, wiping out several smaller tribes and clans, and moving others towards or into our Cherokee Protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA81.A;There is no death. Only a change of worlds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.T;Llamas's trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.D;A peculiar case has emerged from a local Plantagenian court near Nouveau Lancastre. Deng Zixu, a Sanbaoer merchant herding llamas for trade coming from Qingqiu, has alleged that part of his herd was stolen by a local Plantagenian settler. Since the merchant is of 'native' descent, the case has been handed to the BNA, who will adminstrate the case like any other dealing with Native inhabitants of Arcadia. There was no concrete evidence presented during preliminary hearings, but that did not stop Deng from informing his government of the situation. During the subsequent proceedings, the newspapers quickly turned to call the whole affair a ‘Llama’s Trial’, prompting much joy and interest from our own citizenry. Nevertheless, without adequately assuaging Qingqiu's fears over these judicial proceedings, we could face less trade and cooperation with our Western neighbor. More than that, the threat of the Western border needing to be manned during such tenuous times with our Septiman Eastern front is something that is unacceptable to the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA82.A;A strange case from a strange land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.T;Qingqiuese mistreated in Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.D;Letters have been sent back and forth regarding a situation developing in Plantagenia with our local tradesmen being taken advantage of by Plantagenian settlers near Nouveau Lancastre. The Yokut merchant is being tried by Plantagenia's Native Court, which will certainly worsen our relations with them and upset our own citzenry. However there may be an opportunity for a compromise to keep both sides satisfied. While this is not necessarily a priority for the nation, reasserting our sovereignty and importance in international trade would present a prestigious opportunity. As long as we are not too dramatic in our requests, Plantagenia will most likely accommodate us as our trade and neutrality are, if not vital, at least nice to have during these trying times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA83.A;We hope the Plantegenians understand our plight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.T;The Qingqiuese embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.D;The official delegation from Sanbao has arrived with fewer demands than any proud or confident nation would require. With the Qingqiuese demands being so limp-wristed, this has seemingly dampened any jingoistic arguments to ignore such Qingqiuese requests to then instead enhance our own image and prestige. By simply trying the merchant under our regular courts, they would be pleased. This would have no real effect on the verdict delivered, which will please our own people, and it will improve our relations with Qingqiu which is sorely needed when our Eastern border has been threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA84.A;From one sea to another;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.T;Journey to the East successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.D;The reply from the Plantagenian officials has been met with jubilation. They have conceded to all of our demands! Small though they were, keenly, Plantagenia kept its language official and respectful to our nation, pledging that the Qingqiuese merchant will be tried under traditional Plantagenian courts. Our diplomatic issues seemed to be resolved and there is peace on the Eastern front, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA85.A;Our legitimacy and sovereignty are unquestioned! The dragon roars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.T;The Imperial Nobility Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.D;After our subsequent conquest and integration of the old Septiman territory, we have had to conduct new and experimental ways of ensuring traditional support from land barons and other capitalistic influencers. This has resulted in the creation of the Imperial Nobility, these nobles were unlike their older, more prestigious Plantagenian elites. An Imperial Noble would not pass down any title or status to their descendants, instead, these Imperial Nobles would be appointed. Being confirmed as Imperial Nobility for life, as long as they were recognized in an elaborate ceremony within the House of Lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA86.A;Our Empire requires Imperial Nobility;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.T;Le Guépard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.D;A grand marriage has been arranged representing the culmination of our efforts to integrate the new Imperial Nobility into the fabric of our new Imperial Arcadian society. The daughter of the Belgian Trust Director, Edith Rousevelte would be wed to the Prince of Joinville. The Rouseveltes had in the past helped the Joinville family with their local enterprise, resulting in a massive boon to the Joinville companies. This was when the two young heirs would meet and fall in love. This has been incredibly useful to our integration attempts, with the King and his advisors heavily encouraging and assisting in this union between the two families. The marriage will ensure the succession to the much-valued and sought-after titles of the Rouseveltes are secured. This has caused a slight scandal among our traditional Nobility, as they are still quite skeptical that this integration will be a good thing for the Empire, but it’s nothing the King cannot placate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA87.A;Tout doit changer pour que rien ne change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.T;Our Political Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.D;In the end, it was easy to convince these Elites. Why throw away all your power and status, when for the small price of your morals and individual beliefs, you can keep those things in the new Imperial system? These old men were desperate for any way possible to keep their power, their land, and their ability to influence. These political elites were bought off and in return, we have gained their blessing and rights to use the old Septiman political organizations, with the leadership being completely replaced with those loyal to Imperial demands. We have used these organizations to clamp down on republican dissidents that still harbor resentment against the Imperial system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA88.A;The 'Machine politicians' have shown their true colors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA89.T;Those That Build Churches;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA89.D;The act by Charles I to use Imperial funds to recover and rebuild the catholic churches across old Septiman territory has upset and enraged the zealous Protestants among their population. Though the Empire at its foundations claims liberty of conscience for all its citizens, there seems to be no willingness for compromise among these embittered schismatics. There have been reports of small outbreaks of fighting between religious families, along with construction crews for the churches being harassed, and there are talks of organizing a riot or protest against Papist authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLA90.T;Charles I, the First immigrant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA90.D;The evolution of immigration to the New World has become more streamlined and directly encouraged. The benefits of new European settlers are clear as day to the Imperial government. The question of how to integrate these newly arriving immigrants as true Imperial citizens however was another question. Thankfully Charles I himself represented a possible solution the Imperial government was quick to capitalize on. With his roots in Europe, the media and our own propaganda pieces have worked on portraying Charles as 'the first immigrant' to Arcadia. Showcasing him as a brilliant, noble, and civilizing force that gained riches beyond anyone’s wildest dreams simply by making the decision to immigrate to the New World. This has worked to convince and show some Old Worlders the possibilities that await them in Arcadia. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

university_LIB_desc;One of the most insidious aspects of the former Plantagenian torture labor regime is the ways in which enslaved people of color, and many free people of color as well, were denied an education. Though state education programs will solve issues of illiteracy and basic knowledge, we need to build a network of Libérien colleges if our intellectuals are to compete with Europe and the other white regimes of the world. In honor of the Great Liberator of Libérie, we should create a public university to inaugurate the era of Libérien higher education. This internationally accredited college run by and for blacks shall bring us the respect of the world and furnish us with new generations of brilliant and well-trained minds. The Africans of the Dark Ages in Egypt, Mauretania, and Andalus made great strides in mathematics and literature – who knows what our students shall do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

dec_concordate_LIB_desc;Ever since the Revolution, the Roman Catholic Church has been at odds with our regime. While we cannot condone the ways in which they, directly or indirectly, aid white imperialism, the fact of the matter is that the majority of Libériens are Catholics, and this situation is causing them great distress. A solution may now be within our reach. We will send our best diplomats to Rome, where they will negotiate an agreement by which the Church shall be allowed to resume its workings within Libérie. In exchange, we will press the Church to cease its support of white Catholic exiles from Libérie, and place limits on its operation within our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LIB_international_recognition_desc;The punishment which we inflicted upon the Planteurs drew the ire of white regimes throughout the world. In retaliation, many of them have withheld diplomatic recognition of our nation and have maintained only the bare minimum of contact with us. Now, however, we have finally managed to establish sufficient support with one of the great powers and we can leverage that support to boost our nation onto the world stage. We shall hold a lavish diplomatic conference with their representatives, inviting foreign observers and journalists from around the world, and showcase Libérie’s status as a fixture of modernity. This will force the other great powers to engage with us in a civil manner, ending our isolation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The institution’s broad powers were useful during the revolution and in the chaos and violence which followed, but now people are clamoring for true democracy. Most onerous to them is the fact that Sikkerhetskomité members rule by decree and cannot be elected or voted out of office. To avoid a reactionary counter-revolution, we will declare the emergency over and dissolve the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité.

Bellicose members of the cabinet believe that we could force these priests to stir their Indian believers to revolt against the Skraelingr government.

Many of them are Catholics as well, and we cannot allow our brothers and sister in the faith to either be reabsorbed by the Skraelingr or, even worse, fall prey to the Belgians or even the Vinlanders.

NBG_deal_with_SKR_title;Assert our Manifest Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_desc;Centuries ago, when the Burgundians first settled this land, charters were handed down which allotted vast swathes of eastern Arcadia to our colonial predecessors. These borders ran all the way to the Great Lakes, but the Scandinavians eventually secured hegemony in the region and Burgundy was forced to halt its expansion at the Allegheny Mountain valleys. The demise of Scandinavian influence within the Skraelingr Confederacy offers us a new opportunity to at last claim the western lands which have always truly been ours. The time has come to bring civilization and enlightenment to this primitive land. Go west, young man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_title;Pass the Indian Removal Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_desc;When the Western Territories were acquired by $COUNTRY$, many Belgian politicians wanted to find a way to avoid the violent conflict which was guaranteed to erupt between the natives and the settlers. The proposal which won out was to establish a certain region in which the natives could be concentrated and brought to live with one another, as part of a controlled program rather than driven out by settlers themselves. The intent was to transplant native communities to this new safe zone as quickly and cleanly as possible. In truth, the program was a horrifying disaster. Many indigenous communities were destroyed, thousands died from malnutrition or disease on the journey, and those that did arrive eventually fought amongst one another for the meager slivers of land they were allotted by the government. Nevertheless, at the time the policy was seen as a merciful way to save the Indians from the racial violence which had occurred in states like Flande Superyeure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_title;Finish the Western Drive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_desc;The lands which we acquired from the Indians have been a great benefit to our nation, but they are hardly sufficient on their own. Far better would be to secure the rest of the Indian lands, to bring them the fruits of our modern civilization, as well as people enlightened enough to make use of such things. What’s more, we have found older Burgundian documents showing that the furthest western lands of the Indians were accorded to our colonial predecessors by the Burgundian Crown! Clearly, all available evidence points to these lands rightfully belonging to us. We have no reason to tolerate this mistake of Scandinavian foreign policy any longer.

We cannot allow their autonomous status to be used by the Belgians or the Cadiens to cleave them away from us. While full accord with the natives will have to wait until this is accomplished, at the very least we will be able to make guarantees that their rights and cultures will be respected.

The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the Plantagenian storm, but it has not made us a true nation. For this reason, a constitutional convention has been called in Nouvèl Flande, where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new, united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy,” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG1.A;“Nous le Peuple, afin de former une union plus parfaite...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.T;The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.D;The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished, unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable. As Nouvèl Flandre’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital, they seem poised to take the lead of our new union. §R(It is STRONGLY recommended to switch to Nouvèl Flandre if you do not want to be automatically annexed)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG2.A;Our destiny awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.T;The Situation in Sanacomie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.D;During our revolution against the Plantagenian menace, the brave Louisianais of eastern Plantagenia joined forces with the Seven Republics. However, the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset, a town in the Sanacomie region, was able to be saved. The upcoming Arcadian Conference, arranged by the Old Arcadian League (also known as the Brabantians and the “Roosters”) in Vierset, will attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether or not Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue, few of our politicians believe that the Plantagenians will negotiate in good faith, and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG3.A;We shall try our best regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.T;The Arcadian Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.D;As expected, the conference was a total debacle. The Plantagenians repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset, and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province. Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the Old Arcadian League, the Dutch League (isolationists), and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The Old Arcadians drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais, who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to Plantagenia. The conference ended in bitter recrimination, and many are blaming the high-handed Old Arcadians for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG4.A;Well, we tried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.T;The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.D;The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against Plantagenia’s hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” The Dutch League, also known as the “Lions,” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League, or the “Crosses,” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League, also known as the Old Arcadians or the “Roosters,” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends, whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The Old Arcadians believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium, but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.A;The Old Arcadians are right, we need strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.B;The Burgundians persuade the room to uphold liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG5.C;The Calvinists of the Dutch League rally around pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.T;Anti-Cadien Protests!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.D;News of the failure of the Arcadian Conference has stoked the flames of rage against Plantagenia. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south, demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France. The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges, right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag, along with the banners of the Seven Republics, and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG6.A;War is good for some things, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.T;The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.D;“We the People of the Seven Republics, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederation of Belgium.” – Preamble to the Belgian Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire, some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the Belgian Confederacy, our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in Plantagenia. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG7.A;In the name of Belgium, we defy all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.T;The Belgian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.D;The day of unification has finally come : the Belgian constitution has been finalized and signed by our delegation to Nouvelle Bruges. All that remains now is its ratification. As the representatives of our state legislature read it over, hear its preamble echoing through the chamber as read out by the Spreker, an aura of confidence and hope fills the room. It is far from a perfect document – everyone agrees on that – but it is something new, something bold, something proud. It is a sacred promise of liberty and union. The vote itself is a mere formality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG8.A;“Oui!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.T;Belgium has United!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.D;The Planteurs have often disparaged the Seven Republics, confident that their attempts to build a unified, democratic state were a doomed endeavor. The ratification of the Belgian constitution and the consolidation of the Seven Republics into a single nation has thoroughly disproved that notion. While we would prefer to focus on our own affairs, the Belgian admittance of the illegally occupied Plantagenian province of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has ignited a firestorm of anti-Belgian sentiment. This is a direct threat to our territorial integrity! If we allow it to go unchallenged then we would be condoning the annexation of our lands, and who knows where that might lead? Already, the east coast has seen a sharp resurgence of Louisianais nationalism, with the small landholders hopeful that the Belgians might aid their cause. This is the beginning of a crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG9.A;Sanacomie was, is, and will be Cadien!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.T;The Sanacomie Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.D;The inclusion of Vierset within the unified Belgian nation has infuriated the Plantagenians. By officially confirming our annexation of the province, we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists, who wish to revive the revolutionary Republic of Louisiane. Already, several Louisianais groups within Plantagenia have begun agitating for independence, and the Planteurs (Plantagenian slaveowning nobles) accuse us of orchestrating them. Furthermore, the Plantagenian border has seen a notable increase in military activity. So far, no incursions have been made, but both Belgian and Plantagenian militias have made public remarks alluding to “foraging missions” which may soon commence. This is a serious matter, but both of our nations remember the carnage of the Belgian Revolution and are not eager to repeat it. There may be further buildup before the eruption of this crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.A;But when it does erupt, it shall echo across Arcadia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG10.B;The Dutch League convinces the States-General to seek mediation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.T;A Mediation Conference in Porto Dandolo?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.D;We have received an unexpected offer from the wicked Belgians. The threat of war over Vierset has alarmed them, and they wish to attempt a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. They have offered to convene a meeting in the neutral Venetian colony of Athesia, at Porto Dandolo, to attempt to resolve the Sanacomie crisis without bloodshed. Most are dismissive of this overture, viewing it as a mere trick, but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profi – er, life that would occur should war break out. Thus a small but vocal minority are urging the government to seriously consider the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.A;Shout the insolent Belgian diplomat out of the foreign office!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG11.B;This will be interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.T;Plantagenia Refuses Mediation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.D;Plantagenia has completely rejected any attempts at diplomacy. Our representative in Nouvelle-France received a sharp rebuke from the Cadien foreign minister, who denounced our “trampling of the rights of a sovereign nation” and condemned our offer of mediation as a farce! The Dutch League has been publicly humiliated by the failure of their peace overtures, while the Burgundians and the Old Arcadians gear up for the battle to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG12.A;At least we can say that we gave peace a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.T;The Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.D;The mood in Porto Dandolo was unpleasant long before the meeting began. While choosing this location for the conference may have ensured that neither side held an advantage, its oppressive heat and humidity soured everyone’s moods. The conference itself was even worse. The Plantagenians absolutely refused to recognize our sovereignty over Vierset, demanding its immediate “return,” and furthermore blaming us for “inciting insurrection” in Louisiane. Our own delegates attempted to be patient with them, but they finally grew tired of the Cadiens’ antics and presented an ultimatum : surrender Sanacomie – the entire region – to us, or face war. It seems that the Old Arcadian and the Burgundian Leagues had made a secret agreement to authorize our delegation to make this threat if negotiations deadlocked. The Dutch League is furious, but now we can only wait for their reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG13.A;But I thought this was the era of diplomacy and etiquette…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.T;The Belgian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.D;We went to Porto Dandolo in good faith, despite the heat and humidity of the locale, but the Belgians proved unwilling to listen to reason. They ignored every attempt that we made to explain our rights to Vierset, dismissing any pretense of the inviolable nature of our national sovereignty. Soon enough, they showed their true colors and demanded that we surrender the entirety of Sanacomie to them! Our own diplomats have requested permission to terminate the conference and return home unless we wish to make a counter-demand and insist on the return of Vierset. Capitulating to the Belgians could have dire consequences, both for our government and our national stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.A;Yes, let us end this farce and recall our diplomats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.B;One good ultimatum deserves another! Demand Vierset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG14.C;We simply cannot risk war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.T;The Plantagenian Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.D;In answer to our own ultimatum, the Cadiens have given us one of their own : return Vierset immediately, and forfeit any claims on it and the rest of eastern Plantagenia, or face war! The failure of the conference appears imminent, and many believe that the time has come to terminate this endeavor and prepare for inevitable conflict. Capitulating to the Plantagenians could have dire consequences, both for our government and our national stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.A;What a waste of time this was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG15.B;Surely peace is worth a single province?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.T;Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.D;As most Planteurs expected, negotiations with the Belgians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Vierset, and both of our delegations returned home in frustration. The pro-peace Planteurs have been publicly humiliated by this disgrace, and war between our nations now appears inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG16.A;We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.T;Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.D;As the Burgundian and the Old Arcadian Leagues expected, negotiations with the Plantagenians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Sanacomie or even recognizing our possession of Vierset, and both of our delegations returned home in frustration. The Dutch League has been publicly humiliated by this disgrace, and war between our nations now appears inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG17.A;Time to plan our campaign…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.T;The Admission of Vierset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.D;The province of Vierset was originally admitted to the Belgian Confederacy as the “Vierset Territory,” an ambiguous name to reflect its ambiguous status. Now that war with Plantagenia over the region appears certain, we have decided to formally admit the territory as a full state. The only question is how exactly this should be done. The Dutch League believes that it should be admitted under the name of the “State of Sanacomie,” reflecting the legitimacy of our claim to the rest of the region. The Burgundians and the Old Arcadians, however, have presented a competing bill recognizing the “petition for annexation” by the Louisiane Republic! Whichever way we choose to admit Vierset into the Confederation will be taken as a public signal of our aims in the war. §RAttempting to claim all of Louisiane may be beyond our abilities.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.A;The Seven Sisters shall become Eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG18.B;§RAll of Louisiane will fly the Belgian flag!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.T;La Fausse Guerre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.D;While hostilities between the Belgian Confederacy and the Kingdom of Plantagenia are broiling, they have yet to formally escalate to war. The Belgians seem to have armed Louisianais partisans in the hopes of either instigating a Louisianais revolution or at least hampering our own war effort when conflict eventually breaks out. We shall have to tackle this issue before confronting the Confederacy on the battlefield. §BIf we have not expended too many resources elsewhere – such as in Cymrie or the southwestern Great Lakes – then we stand a good chance of succeeding.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG19.A;A mere distraction, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.T;Decisive Victory over the Louisianais Partisans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.D;The Louisianais guerillas have been crushed! With our comfortable reserves of resources and manpower, we were able to divert sufficient forces into the eastern lands to root out the traitors and disarm them. Mounted patrols kept us informed of attacks and allowed us to intercept several partisan forces while they were in transit between bases. We were even able to induce some Catholic priests to give sermons in the region denouncing the Protestant Belgians, stressing that if the Louisianais were to throw their lot in with the northerners, they would be even worse off than before. These efforts have not eliminated Louisianais separatism but the threat of an armed insurrection collaborating with the Belgians has been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG20.A;That’s one less thing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.T;Constantin Leclère;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.D;A young Planteur who has purchased a military commission has caught the attention of our high command. Constantin Leclère is a dashing and handsome figure with a short yet impressive record. In addition to participating in numerous raids on the natives, he has served overseas with distinction in the Anglois Armée Royale. While he had been making plans to travel west with his brother Armand and establish a plantation in Cymrie, the escalation of tensions with the Belgian Confederacy has instead caused him to enroll in the army as an officer. Leclère is a tall and powerfully built man, with a bold, forceful attitude and no small number of female admirers. If even half of the rumors of his conduct against the Indians and his service with the Anglois are true, then he may have a keen grasp of strategy and tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG21.A;An *officer?* Mon Dieu, this man needs an army to command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.T;Minor Failure against the Louisianais Partisans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.D;Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to fully eradicate the Louisianais guerillas. We have identified several weapons caches, arrested some notable leaders of the movement, and foiled multiple plots to attack military forts and depots. This has reduced the danger posed by these partisans but not ended it. Patrols continue to report occasional harassing fire from the woods, and several local politicians are believed to be corresponding with the Belgian government, though nothing can be proven. We simply do not have the resources to fully root out all the guerillas in a timely manner. Our efforts against the Belgians will be made somewhat more difficult by all this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG22.A;Mission accomplished?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.T;Decisive Defeat against the Louisianais Partisans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.D;Louisiane is in chaos. With our resources stretched thin across multiple areas, we have not been able to make much progress at all against the guerillas. Our forces moving through the east are constantly harried by fire from the woodlands, local militias have refused to cooperate with the royal army, and we have had to impose martial law across Louisiane. Even foreign sailors docking in eastern ports have grown noticeably wary of venturing too far into the cities for fear of being swept up in yet another outbreak of violent unrest. The only bright spot in all of this is that the clamor of Louisianais nationalism has somewhat drowned out abolitionism in the east, as the white smallholders are prioritizing their own freedom over that of the slaves. When the Belgians come, they shall find no lack of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG23.A;Que Dieu punisse la Belgique!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.T;Military High Command Proposes a Lightning Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.D;Our generals have drawn up plans for the invasion of Plantagenia. Currently, their favored approach is a quick seizure of Sanacomie, before consolidating our gains and pressing further south if conditions are right. By attacking as soon as possible, without giving the Plantagenians too much time to redirect their forces eastward, we can catch them at minimal readiness. The risks of such a plan are twofold. First, if our generals have overestimated our own preparedness, then we might rush to war without the resources to sustain prolonged operations. Second, if the Plantagenians are counting on drawing us into an extended defensive campaign, pressing the attack so rapidly will only play into their hands. The Old Arcadians and most of the Burgundians want to strike now, but the Dutch and a vocal Burgundian minority favor a small delay to finalize our preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.A;Cry, “Havoc!” And let slip the dogs of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG24.B;Attacking so soon would be foolhardy, continue our preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.T;The End of the Tactical Delay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.D;Our military preparations are now complete, and the Plantagenians have not made the first move in the interim. If they were expecting a rapid offensive from us, then they should now be thoroughly confused. Our generals believe that the time has now come to commence our attack. While the Dutch League has been holding out for a further delay – possibly as a desperate final attempt to avert war – most of our government feels that our armed forces are as ready as they will ever be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.A;Eia, eia, eia, alala!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG25.B;We’ve had one delay, but what about a second one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.T;The Battle of Fort Villefranche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.D;A company of militiamen from Base-Valoisy recently decided to carry out a “reconnaissance in force” near the Plantagenian border. Whether or not they intended to cross said border, they soon ended up in Cadien territory, and encountered a military base named Fort Villefranche. The fort’s sentries saw them as the militiamen were trying to verify whether it was Belgian or Plantagenian – there was heavy rain, and the fort’s flag was not clearly visible. A group of Plantagenian soldiers came out to confront them and what happened next is disputed. The survivors of the militia swear that they were leaving, only for the Cadiens to attack them as they fled. Newspapers in Plantagenia allege that the Base-Valoisais attacked the Plantagenians and then tried to assault the fort itself, before being driven off by its cannons. The truth may never be known but what matters now is that this incident has forced our hand – our war with the Cadiens has already begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG26.A;Alea iacta est!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.T;The Arcadian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.D;“The past is dead : let it bury its dead, its hopes and its aspirations : before you lies the future - a future full of golden promise.” – Charles I, King of Plantagenia\n\nWhen the guns of the Belgian Revolution fell silent, and Charles II de Orleans’ mad dream of a continental empire perished, many thought that peace might prevail in Arcadia. That dream, too, has perished, sacrificed upon the altar of a city called Vierset. What started as a dispute over a single province has escalated into a clash of civilizations. The conflict to come is not merely about Vierset, Sanacomie, or even Louisiane. It is nothing less than the deciding contest of which nation shall assume leadership of Arcadia. Will it be the Kingdom of Plantagenia, the realm of master and slave? Or the Belgian Confederacy, where all are equal, yet some are more equal than others? These questions shall not be settled by debate or parliamentary majority, but by iron and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG27.A;What does the corpse care who was right or who was wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.T;The War in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.D;A specter is haunting Vinland – the specter of the Arcadian Empire. The efforts of the Plantagenians to subjugate the eastern half of the continent under their rule do not seem so remote anymore. Newspapers bring accounts of Cadien armies defeating the Belgians in battle after battle. If Plantagenia prevails in this contest, then we will be the only power in Arcadia capable of resisting them. Worst of all, we have heard stories of especially deluded Planteurs beginning to speak glibly of “restoring” the Arcadian Empire! We cannot allow Vinland to be plunged back into such a nightmare! Our people, of all races, have sacrificed too much to tolerate such a monstrosity. Shall we intervene and lend our strength to the righteous Belgian Confederacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.A;We are coming, Stadtholder, three hundred thousand more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG28.B;And for what? To hand Belgium domination of Arcadia instead? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.T;The Collapse of the Old Arcadian Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.D;The Belgian Confederacy and the Kingdom of Plantagenia have erupted into war with one another. The reasons for the war itself – the city of Vierset, the region of Sanacomie, or the nation of Louisiane – are a matter of dispute. What is not disputed is that the Belgians have obtained the clear upper hand in the conflict. Newspapers bring accounts of Belgian armies defeating the Cadiens in battle after battle. If the Confederacy is victorious, then we will be the only power in Arcadia capable of resisting them. The idea of aiding Plantagenia is unpleasant, but the idea of Belgium using victory in this war to propel themselves to greater aspirations is even worse. The Confederacy’s desire to seize the Great Lakes is far from secret. Perhaps the Plantagenian devil that we know is preferable to the Belgian devil that we don’t know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.A;Belgium must be stopped, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG29.B;Dealing with devils is only ever a losing proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.T;The War of Northern Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.D;As if our current struggle was not enough, now the Vinlanders have intervened on the side of our enemy! The Vinlanders have made a number of justifications for doing so, ranging from accusations of $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ troops illegally crossing through their borders, to Vinlandic ships being harassed by our navy. The truth is obvious : Vinland, which once fought off attempts to enfold it within the so-called “Arcadian Empire,” fears that we might seek to unify the continent once more if we prevail. The path to victory just got steeper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG30.A;Yet climb it we must and climb it we shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.T;Victory over the Belgians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.D;The mighty Armée Royale has shattered our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Belgians to launch a Louisianais partisan offensive in tandem with their invasion, neither effort brought them success. The Belgians were not only forced out of our own lands but suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Confederacy. Facing further humiliation, their Stadtholder agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset restored to us, and the Belgians have been forced to forsake any future attempts to lay claim to any part of Louisiane. Furthermore, all assistance to Louisiane nationalists by the Belgians has ended. Some are bitter that we did not make further gains, but if the reports of mass protests in Nouvelle Bruges are anything to go by, then our victory may have irreversibly fractured the foundation of the Belgian Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG31.A;God really did save the South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.T;Victory over the Plantagenians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.D;The invincible Armée Confédérée has triumphed over our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Plantagenians to strangle the Louisianais spirit in tandem with their defense, we persevered. The Cadiens suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Kingdom. After our Stadtholder threatened to ignite a second Louisianais revolution, their ruler and their bloated Planteurs agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset reunited with the rest of Sanacomie, and all Plantagenian claims to the region permanently forfeited. The people rejoice at the Confederacy’s victory, and the unbreakable solidarity of our nation has been cemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG32.A;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.T;Victory over the Plantagenians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.D;The invincible Armée Confédérée has triumphed over our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Plantagenians to strangle the Louisianais spirit in tandem with their defense, we persevered. The Cadiens suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Kingdom. After our Stadtholder threatened to conquer all the way to Nouvelle-Orleans, their ruler and their bloated Planteurs agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen all of Louisiane liberated at last, and Plantagenia’s claims to the region permanently forfeited. §RWhile many people are rejoicing at the Confederacy’s victory, the sheer scale of our gains has resulted in tremendous overextension. The free states have also expressed concern at what the admission of so much slaveholding territory will mean for the future of slavery in Belgium…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG33.A;Three rousing cheers for the Confederacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.T;Épuisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.D;The war in Sanacomie has failed to produce a clear victor. We have been unable to dislodge the Plantagenians from the east, but they have not made significant gains in our own lands, either. Yet all hope is not lost. Just as we were preparing to consider new negotiations, we received a message from Nouvelle-Orleans. Plantagenia’s government is far more overextended than even we suspected. They have surrendered the region of Sanacomie to us to bring the war to a close. The Old Arcadians are infuriated that we have lost the chance to claim all of Louisiane but most Belgians are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG34.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.T;Épuisement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.D;The war in Sanacomie has failed to produce a clear victor. We have been unable to dislodge the Belgians from the north, but they have not made significant gains in our own lands, either. Yet all hope is not lost. Nouvelle Bruges has finally seen the writing on the wall and has reopened diplomatic channels with us. They have returned Vierset to us, in exchange for the token concession of forfeiting any claim to Belgian lands north of Sanacomie. A few more bloodthirsty Planteurs are dismayed that we have lost the chance to acquire more lands to expand slavery into but most Cadiens are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG35.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.T;The End of the Arcadian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.D;The war in Sanacomie has come to a close. While our people are divided as to whether our efforts to intervene were wise, such matters are, in practical terms, now irrelevant. Rather than face the enemy alone, we have agreed to a peace of status quo in the name of Arcadian stability – whatever that means now, given the carnage which has blanketed the east.  Perhaps we have averted the return of militant pan-Arcadianism, or perhaps we have only hastened its renewal. For now, most Vinlanders are simply relieved that we can put this conflict behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG36.A;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.T;Une Crise de Foi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.D;“The annexation of Louisiane can be summarized as wrong, dangerous, and subversive of our institutions. It was wrong, because at no point had our nation or any of its predecessors claimed Louisiane. Even our forefathers in the days of the Revolution made no such claim. It was dangerous, because it has entangled the armed forces of all the States within policing actions and made us the eternal enemy of Plantagenia. It was subversive of our institutions, because its acquisition threatens to enshrine forever the Slave Power within Belgium. I can think of no better comparison than the flight of Icarus : the grandeur of our success more than outweighed by the ruinous consequences of our folly.” – Caroline Representative Daniel van Buren\n\nOur liberation of Louisiane has produced unforeseen consequences. Multiple states are now fearful of the confederal government’s power, while others worry that Louisane’s admission will permanently empower the Old Arcadians, many of whom are Southern slaveowners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG37.A;But, it was our destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.T;The Louisianais Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.D;“We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal, and endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…Having received innumerable proofs that there exist no stewards of our nation but ourselves, we reclaim the ancient freedoms of our forefathers and thus our honor.” – Declaration of Louisianais Independence\n\nThe free states of the Confederacy have completely withdrawn all military and financial resources from Louisiane in protest of its annexation. The slave states have tried to keep order, but the burden of administration has outstripped them. The chaos in Louisiane which has thus arisen has caused their nationalists to lose faith in our leadership. They have now taken measures into their own hands and declared independence, and partisans are running rampant in the region. The Armée Confédérée is holding on to what areas of Louisiane that it can but most of the south has already seceded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG370.A;How could this have happened!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.T;Sororicide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.D;The Seven Sisters are at each other’s throats. While at first it seemed that the only consequence of our defeat against the Plantagenians would be the loss of Vierset and certain punitive conditions imposed upon our military, the true repercussions have only now shown themselves. The failure of the Armée Confédérée has opened the floodgates of political discord. The Dutch League is declaring that its views were correct and that the whole war was a ruinous error : the Burgundian League is blaming the Old Arcadians for allowing their greed to drive the Confederacy to ruin : and the Old Arcadians are accusing the other two leagues, especially the Dutch, of stabbing the nation in the back. For the first time since the ratification of the Constitution, the flags of the individual republics are a more common sight than the confederal one. Protests are breaking out across the nation, and the word on the lips of many politicians – in private or even in public – is “secession”…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG38.A;Do not lose faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.T;The Vote of No Confidence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.D;The loss of Louisiane could not be readily explained in or to the States-General. No amount of adroit speechcraft by the Stadtholder or any of his political allies could satisfy the legislature’s outrage at the loss of the territory whose liberation was our reason for waging war against the Cadiens. It soon became apparent that they didn’t want mere answers – they wanted heads to roll. This morning a vote of no confidence was held, and the government lost. Snap elections have been called but the Stadtholder has already resigned in disgrace. Ominously, this has not brought an end to our instability. If anything, it has exacerbated it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG39.A;Losing the Stadtholder was bad, but at least things can’t get any worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.T;The Western Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.D;“There was an assumption of the equality of races entertained by leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution. It was a sandy foundation, as was the idea of a Government built upon it. When the ‘storm came and the wind blew, it fell.’ The foundations of our new government are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the fact that neither the negro nor the Indian are equal to the white man - that subordination to the superior race is inevitable. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this self-evident truth. The other republics have betrayed this truth and plunged daggers into our backs. We shall  suffer their abuses no longer.” – Hôte Valoisy Grand Pensionary Jean Slechteman\n\nThe dream of Liberty and Union has been murdered by the Seven Sisters’ vendettas. This morning the Burgundians from Hôte Valoisy and Flandre Supéryeure withdrew to their home states, which have both declared secession. This is the beginning of a crisis, but the worst may be yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG40.A;Bella, horrida bella, Et Thybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.T;Declaration of a State of Emergency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.D;“Article 20 : In the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution, or if public security is clearly endangered, the Stadtholder may take measures necessary to restore law and order, intervening if need be with the aid of the armed forces. For this purpose, he may suspend for a while, in whole or in part, the rights provided in Articles 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. The Stadtholder must inform the States-General without delay of all measures taken in accordance with this Article. These measures are to be revoked on the demand of the States-General…” – The Belgian Constitution\n\nThe Old Arcadians have made their move. Our crisis has allowed them, with the support of their rich backers, to maneuver their candidate, shipping baron Gerhard Monfried, into the stadtholdership. He has promptly invoked Article 20. For all intents and purposes, Belgium is no longer a democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG41.A;It’s only temporary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.T;The Espérance Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.D;“Resolved, That, in light of the public danger posed to the aforesaid States, it is recommended to their Legislatures to pass laws authorizing the Grand Pensionaries or Commanders in Chief of their militia to make detachments from the same, or to form voluntary corps, as shall be most suitable to their Constitutions, and to cause the same to be well armed, equipped and disciplined, and held in readiness for service : and upon the request of the Grand Pensionary of either of the other States, to employ the whole of such units, as well as the regular forces of the State, in assisting the State, making such request to repel any invasion thereof which shall be made or attempted…” – The Espérance Declaration\n\nThe Dutch League was outraged by the Old Arcadians’ seizure of power. They may not have had the resources to stop it, but they were determined to resist. Now Caroline and Filipine, the Dutch heartland, have both declared their intent to defend themselves against the confederal government, effectively seceding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG42.A;Rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.T;The Tyranny of Duke Alexandre I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.D;“The republican order is crashing down. Never has such evidence been given of the weakness of democracy. This those in antiquity knew. Did Athens not crumble in the face of Macedon? Did Rome not take up the imperial laurel? We have inherited all the old flaws of republicanism. The only way to shed them is to cast off the whole shell. Like the phoenix we emerge from the ashes of death into the bloom of life : that we do so resting upon the ancient principles of rulership is natural.” – Duke Alexandre I of Base-Valoisy\n\nThroughout our struggles, one promise was held sacred : opposition to monarchical rule. That vow has now been blasphemed. Grand Pensionary Alexandre Saftleven of Base-Valoisy has crowned himself Duke of the region, and now rules the land as his private fief. §RThe remaining Belgians are now ready to make any sacrifice to obliterate this scourge from the earth. The Stadtholder’s reaction to this news spoke for us all.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG43.A;“I want Base-Valoisy BURNED TO THE GROUND!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.T;The Sacred War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.D;The vile traitors of Base-Valoisy foolishly believed that we would wallow in despair rather than deliver righteous vengeance upon them. Their profaning of the republican cause, however, has rendered their annihilation necessary. Now, we go forth to wipe the stain of Base-Valoisy from the face of the Earth. Forget any ridiculous prattle about the “Seven Sisters!” These disgusting vermin are no kin of ours. There is only one course of action which we must follow, without straying, without ceasing, until it is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG44.A;Tuez-les tous! Dieu reconnaîtra les siens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.T;Sic Semper Tyrannus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.D;It is done. Base-Valoisy has been righteously punished. Not since the harrowing of the Albigensians has such slaughter  as we have unleashed upon Base-Valoisy been seen amongst the children of the Franks. Entire communities have been erased, burned ruins their only memorial. In town after town, loyalists of the hated traitor Alexandre Saftleven have been hung from the streetlamps, their homes sacked and torched, their names struck out of registries to destroy their very memories. The cathartic release of our long-suffering people, who have finally destroyed the deceivers in our midst, has been a great salve. The capture of the false Duke was best of all. Hauled back to Nouvelle Bruges, he was convicted of treason, hanged in front of the Stadtholder’s residence, and his body then preserved and shipped back to Base-Valoisy. From there, it was brought to the Plantagenian border and gibbeted in sight of a Cadien fort! Let that Judas Iscariot be a testament to the fate of despots in Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG45.A;Live free or die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.T;God Save the King of New Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.D;That was a brilliant plan, Your Majesty! Simply brilliant! Only you, my lord, could have known that the unwashed rabble of Nouvèl Flande and its ilk would’ve been so overcome with fury that they’d be blind to your stellar maneuvers! I mean, that encirclement which you pulled off at the border was a thing of beauty! And the way in which you directed the cavalry, cutting those ruffians down when they tried to flee – magnificent! Oh, I do wish we’d had more time to plan the coronation, but all things considered, I believe it went rather well, if I do say so myself, Your Majesty. Watching that dreadful Stadtholder hung, drawn, and quartered was certainly a clever way to cap off the festivities. But my lord – and I know how busy you are now, what with the royal court, and negotiations with all those corporate men – I just want to know, how did you know it all would work out? How did you know that the people needed not just a duke, but a king, and that they’d recognize you were the one to lead them – to lead us all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG46.A;We are simply that good, dear subject. Run along, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.T;Pacifying the “Pacifists”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.D;With Base-Valoisy crushed, we must now turn to the north. The loathsome Dutch League stabbed us in the back when they convinced not just one, but two republics to secede from us in our time of need! For decades, their cowardly “pacifists” have obstructed TRUE Belgian patriots from doing what must be done. Call us Old Arcadians, Brabantians, or Roosters, but we are and have always been the only people who see the one true future of Belgium. But that glorious day – that shining promise of a union unlike any ever before seen – is far off yet. Now, we shall continue paving the road towards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG47.A;And we shall pave it over the bones of Caroline and Filipine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.T;De Grote Zuivering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.D;The Grote Zuivering or “Great Purge” was a campaign of targeted killings against Carolinean and Filipinean nationalists, pacifists, and Calvinists by Belgian troops in $YEAR$. While it is difficult to pin down the start of the violence, most point to an order issued by General Antonin Snieckers to “root our partisan activity” in Binche. In towns across the north, notable Dutch Leaguers and their families were hunted down and massacred. The spectacular violence caused thousands of Carolinians and Filipineans to flee their homes, with most settling in Vinland. Several communities, notably Waterstad and Leuven, were almost totally depopulated. The carnage ended the Dutch League’s status as one of the two largest parties. Notoriously, the Belgian government denied that any violence had occurred. Even in modern times most Belgian historians either do not recognize the Grote Zuivering or downplay its severity. A quote from Nouvèl Loraine Grand Pensionary Émile van de Graaf sums up the views of most Brabantians on the matter at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG48.A;“Nothing has happened, but if something happened, then they deserved it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.T;Peace in Our Time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.D;“True Christian believers are sheep among wolves…Neither do they use worldly sword or war, since all killing has ceased with them.” – Conrad Grebel\n\nThe torch of liberty has driven out the darkness! While we, the Dutch Leaguers of Caroline and Filipine, took no pleasure in battling our southern kinsmen, we could not allow ourselves to be subsumed within the monstrosity which the Old Arcadians wrought. Now that the government is back in the hands of reason, a new constitutional convention has been called to remove the deficiencies from the present document. Article 20, which enabled the Brabantians and their corporate backers to wreak such havoc, must go. A new generation is arising, one which shall beat their swords into plowshares and build a more equal, equitable, and just Belgium. Perhaps the newest political party, founded by disaffected young members of the Dutch League and led by author Abraham Haafner, is the best sign of our political future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG49.A;Long live the Idealists! Long live the free Belgian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.T;The State of Emergency is Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.D;When the Old Arcadians, aided by certain men of means, used Article 20 of the Belgian Constitution to turn the Stadtholder into a dictator, they knew that such measures could not last. As soon as the States-General could reconvene and reach quorum, they passed a measure demanding an end to the state of emergency, as was their right according to Article 20. Rather than ignite a constitutional crisis so soon after the recent conflicts, the Old Arcadians decided to acquiesce. The state of emergency has come to an end, and democracy is reasserting itself. Despite the return of civil liberties, however, a precedent has been set which may be used to restore authoritarianism in the future. Nobody is more pleased at this prospect than the Old Arcadians…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG50.A;What matters is that we have prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.T;Nouvelle Bruges Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.D;Our efforts to blaze our own trail on the world stage may have come to an abrupt end. The central government in Nouvelle Bruges has defeated all challenges – and was tremendously brutal in doing so. Many within our own government are now fearful that such violence may be wrought upon our own people as punishment for “betraying” the easterners. It is foolish to think that they would understand the reasons why our actions were necessary. Perhaps we should simply petition for re-annexation, and spare our people the bloodshed which has already turned the south and the north crimson red?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.A;“Seven Sisters” and all that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG51.B;Give us liberty or give us death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG52.T;The Formation of the New Arcadian Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG52.D;“The events of the past few years have effectively abrogated all compromises, real or imaginary, in the political field. Slavery and the interests of the monied elite have advanced, while the interests of the common man and honest industry have shrunken to our collective detriment. Our is a simple platform : fair and safe immigration, a common and unqualified franchise, the breaking of the Trusts and their grip upon the government, and the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime, in any of the Territories of the Belgian Confederacy. If our continent is to emerge into the future, it will only be under the light of liberty.” – Resolution of the New Arcadian Association (later the New Arcadian Party) of Nouvèl Flandre, $YEAR$\n\nThe inability of the Dutch League to effectively confront the Burgundians and the Old Arcadians has caused a new, radical generation of young liberals and dissatisfied veterans to break away. While espousing pan-Arcadian rhetoric, they also demand massive reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG52.A;Government of the people, by the people, for the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.T;The “Fourth League”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.D;The creation of the New Arcadian Party has destabilized Belgian politics. Ever since our independence from Plantagenia, the Burgundians and the Dutch held one another in check, with the Brabantians being further counterbalanced by the two. The emergence of a radical liberal party has shattered all of this. Not only are the New Arcadians advocating substantial political change as well as pan-Arcadianism, but they have also broken all the typical rules of Belgian political organization. They have eschewed respectable politics in favor of organizing street rallies and distributing political literature in communities across the nation. The fact that they do not trace their ancestry back to any cultural group is even more unsettling to the established parties. Some say that the Belgian political sphere is unravelling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG53.A;Surely this is a mere bump in the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.T;De Wylde Rytt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.D;The “Wylde Rytt” is a phrase which emerged around $YEAR$ to describe the political conditions in the Belgian Confederacy. Factors such as the emergence of new political parties, the slavery debate, increased urbanization, widening economic disparity, and growing immigration, all led to heightened public tension. The ten-year period of the Wylde Rytt saw multiple parties follow the New Arcadian example and adopt tactics of mass organization, while political machines sought to capture and manipulate the immigrant vote, causing their opponents to double down on anti-immigrant rhetoric. The decade also saw Belgian corporations, influential since the Hanse der Neuen Welt (HNW) moved from Lübeck to Arcadia and led to the creation of the New Burgundy Colony in the 17th century, rapidly gaining power. Above all was a growing feeling that the current Belgian constitution was insufficient and required amendment or even replacement. The result was a cavalcade of political struggle which often erupted into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG54.A;Hold on tight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.T;The Rise of Les Fiducies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.D;Ever since the Hanseatic League fled to New Burgundy to escape destruction at the hands of Scandinavia after the Imperial Wars of Religion (1605-1621), and the founding of the HNW in 1669, corporations have remained a pillar of Belgian society. The concept of the business trust is centuries old. One party conveys legal possession and title of certain property to a second party, a trustee. While that trustee has ownership, they cannot use the property, but holds it 'in trust' for the well-being of another. Thus a few people may control vast conglomerates. In the years after the Arcadian War, the trusts (or “Les Fiducies” to refer to them as a unit), began to amass unprecedented power. Often backing the Old Arcadian Party, they sought to reorganize Belgium into a centralized, militarized, expansionist state, and to develop a symbiotic relationship with the government. §RIf we allow Les Fiducies to gain too much influence, then they will turn our confederacy into a corporatocracy, with terrible consequences for liberty and justice.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG55.A;“And much of Madness, and more of Sin, And Horror the soul of the plot.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.T;Les Fiducies Aid Southern Reconstruction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.D;The end of the Arcadian War saw substantial damage across Sanacomie. Many slaveowners in the region, though possessing substantial capital, were more concerned with rebuilding and preserving their own plantations than restoring the region. Now a bill has come before the States-General to use assistance from Les Fiducies to rebuild Sanacomie. The bill’s provisions include subsidies for investments in the region, a generous contract system for infrastructure expansion, and the weakening of regulations involving the use of immigrant labor. While the Old Arcadians are the chief architects of the bill, the Burgundians are particularly intrigued by its provisions about providing grants for corporations to construct new settlements in Sanacomie, believing such a system could be replicated in the west. The Burgundians also envision using it to assist in settling the Great Lakes, a region that they have long coveted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.A;An excellent proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG56.B;There’ll be no carpetbagging in Sanacomie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.T;Les Fiducies Aid Western Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.D;As expected, the Burgundians have now rallied around using the support of Les Fiducies to bolster infrastructure in the west. The newest bill before the States-General is largely a replication of the terms of the previous one, except geared towards creating new constructions in Hôte Valoisy and Flandre Supéryeure rather than restoring old ones in Sanacomie. This bill, however, is focused on attracting new western settlers. It would substantially decrease harbor fees for shipping companies bringing immigrants, provide subsidies for prospective employers to hire immigrants overseas and bring them to work in Belgium, and award lucrative railroad contracts on a non-competitive basis to certain corporations. The fact that strengthened infrastructure and new settlements in the west would aid a future war to claim the lands of the Great Lakes has not gone unnoticed by the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.A;Another victory for private-public partnerships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG57.B;Don’t you know what they do to immigrants out there? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.T;De Jonge Brigades;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.D;The abolition debate in Nouvèl Loraine has now grown ferocious. Many new immigrants, particularly those from Germany, are angry that substantial amounts of rural land continue to be bound up in vast slave plantations, causing something of a land crisis. Now some radicals are resorting to violent measures. The Jonge Brigades (“Young Brigades”) and other such groups are waging a partisan war against slavery. While some are merely freeing slaves, others are attacking plantations, arming the slaves, and driving out or killing the slaveowners, before burning their estates. In the aftermath, much of the land is being bought up by Les Fiducies, who are parceling it out and selling or renting it to freed slaves and immigrants. Others are exploring the newly “vacant” areas for minerals. While nothing can be proven – so far – these Jonge Brigades seem to have been organized and armed quite well in a short amount of time. It’s hard to afford the shiny new rifles they carry, and all that ammunition, on a common wage…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.A;Any ally in the war on slavery is appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG58.B;PRIVATE MILITIAS attacking OUR citizens? The army will end this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.T;The Great Maline Dock Strike of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.D;Like most of Nouvèl Flande, the city of Maline grew tremendously during the 19th century. It prospered as a manufacturing hub due to its proximity to iron mines in Flandre Supéryeure and Nouvèl Loraine. However, the growing immigrant population in Maline was the victim of severe prejudice, with most labor organizations refusing them membership. The growth of Blanquist thought amongst Maline unions, however, promoted the idea of class solidarity. This led to the Great Maline Dock Strike of $YEAR$, launched in protest of dangerous working conditions, by workers of various nationalities and religions. The unprecedented unity displayed by the strikers unnerved employers – yet a solution presented itself. The Roosevelt Detective Agency had been formed several years prior, and often aided Les Fiducies by violently attacking unions. It was proposed to the Stadholder at the time, Johan Thiers, to use the Roosevelts to break the strike. As everyone knows…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.A;The Maline strikebreaking was where the Roosevelts became famous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG60.B;Thiers refused and the Armée Confédérée crushed the strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.T;The Second Belgian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.D;Historians point to many factors in explaining the events of $YEAR$ : economic upheaval, the debate on slavery or the Constitution, nativism, the growth of new parties, or even the emergence of millenarian religious movements. What is not disputed is that by this time Les Fiducies had not merely gained power over the government – they WERE the government, needing only someone to put forward as their champion. Now, a charismatic veteran named Leopold Salan has led a group of armed Old Arcadians to seize L'hôtel Phrygien in Nouvelle Bruges and proclaim himself Stadtholder! When the army was sent to capture them, Salan gave a spellbinding balcony speech which won them over, soon joined by many supporters, jubilant at the end of weak rule. More than a few streets ran red with the blood of Salan’s enemies, but soon the States-General was taken, and the Stadtholder’s palace claimed. Now our nation will have true, strong, invincible leadership! The leadership of Stadtholder Salan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG61.A;And the rule of Les Fiducies behind him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.T;Emancipation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.D;It has been many years since our independence, but our nation is not yet free. Not only do we possess myriad external foes – Plantagenia and Vinland especially – but there is no shortage of traitors within our midst. The legions of un-Belgian villains are endless : Blanquists, Jesuits, Freemasons, Hebrews, Negroes, Indians…Thankfully, Stadtholder Salan knows them well. He has seen fit to pass the Emancipation from Public Enemies Act, which shall free us from these menaces forever! The first half of the act created the Gendarmerie Nationale, the first fully national military police force. The original constitutional drafters may have been too cowardly to establish such a group, but we know now that it is necessary. The second half awards them, and the newly created Ministry of Supervision, broad authority to defend our freedom. Already they are sweeping the nation, rooting out any unpatriotic menaces! Soon we shall purge the rot from our national body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG62.A;Les Fiducies may grow during the chaos but it is a mere coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.T;The Proclamation of the Septiman Directorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.D;“When some man arises with a nature of sufficient force, he shakes off all that we have taught him, bursts his bonds, and breaks free : he tramples underfoot our codes and juggleries, our charms and ‘laws,’ which are all against nature : our servant rises in revolt and shows himself our master, and there dawns the full light of natural justice.” – Plato\n\nThe Belgian Confederacy was rotten to its core. The only solution was to start over from scratch. This morning Leopold Salan gathered his supporters at his residence in Nouvelle Bruges. From his podium he declared the end of the Belgian Confederacy. In its place he raised up a new nation, one built on everlasting might! He declared himself Directeur of the Septiman Directorate, as is his right as a great man of destiny! The time has come, he declared, to bring order to Arcadia – OUR order, the order of superior Septimania! With Les Fiducies at his back and the Septiman people following his banner, we shall march to victory over all enemies of our holy nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG63.A;§RManifest Destiny shall heal our wounds and sorrow.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.T;The Third Belgian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.D;The Third Belgian Revolution is also known as the “Bread and Roses Revolution” after a popular protest slogan and song, “Bread” symbolizing both an end to food shortages and restoration of basic freedoms, and “Roses” symbolizing democracy and expansion of workers’ and minority rights. It started in Filipine, when thousands of female garment workers in Leuven went on strike to protest unfair working conditions. The Gendarmerie Nacionale’s attack on the strikers ignited citywide fighting. Word of the strike spread and workers in Phillipia went on strike as well. Protests soon swept the nation. The decisive moment came when soldiers in Nouvelle Bruges were ordered to fire on a crowd of protestors, only to instead join them. The crowd stormed government and corporate offices across the capital, before capturing the Directeur. He and the heads of Les Fiducies were tried and executed in a highly publicized trial to unveil the horrific crimes of the regime. The new government has devoted itself to defending the people without violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG64.A;Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.T;The New Colossus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.D;Our nation has been transformed since the first Directeur bravely took power. The Gendarmerie are a common sight in the streets, while the Ministry of Supervision have detailed records of all citizens. Walled “Sequestrations” keep each unruly minority within its own community. Education covers vital topics like basic military training, racial science, and herology, the study of great men and women in history. The destruction of treasonous faiths like Catholicism and Anabaptism has led to the emergence of more vibrant, esoteric, militant sects better suited to our new society. All the while, the great Fiducies keep our honorable people supplied with excellent new products, especially the cocaine-infused cigarettes and candies so valued by frontline units (and the sodas for all ages). The indenture system provides them with all the labor they could ever want. All political groups have aligned towards our Manifest Destiny, greatly aiding national stability and efficiency. Our is a proud, pious, superior civilization – the pinnacle race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG65.A;§RIn God we trust.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.T;The Crescendo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.D;Belgian political instability has reached extreme levels. Political clubs of all ideologies are mobilizing their supporters in the streets, and many have begun to carry weapons. While in some cities, these clubs simply hold marches and rallies, in others they are attacking each other and the police. Immigrant groups, in turn, are turning to ethnic street gangs for protection. All the while, the authority of the confederal and state governments continues to conflict, and Les Fiducies seek further opportunities to consolidate power. A solution may now be in sight. For years, activists have been pressuring state legislatures to adopt measures calling upon the States-General to call another constitutional convention, to address unresolved problems with the current constitution, as is their right under Article 6. This morning Hôte-Valoisy passed such a measure, being the last state to do so. The States-General have now declared that the Eleventh Constitutional Convention shall be held in Nouvelle Bruges in two weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG66.A;God willing, it will be the last…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.T;The Opening of the Eleventh Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.D;The original Belgian Constitution had been hammered out with the Sanacomie issue looming over the delegates’ heads. For this reason there were many aspects of it which did not receive proper attention. It is hoped that this convention will be different, and that the document it produces will stand the test of time. The first major issue to arise was that of centralization. Both Old and New Arcadians are skeptical of centralization, for different reasons, but others believe it has proved unworkable. Centralizers are in turn divided as to whether the confederal government should merely assume further powers (the Dutch view) or if the individual republics’ governments should be dissolved and the nation fully centralized (the Burgundian view). §BWhichever group prevails in this convention will enshrine their values as the bedrock of Belgium.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.A;No centralization! We shall not sacrifice liberty for security!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.B;The confederal government needs more rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG67.C;A unitary system is what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.T;Isolationists Demand Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.D;The Dutch League has begun to modify its pacifist stance as of late. Whereas the party once hewed closely to notions of Calvinist and Anabaptist morality, they have now shifted towards more secular and economic-focused ideas of domestic reform and internal improvements. For this reason, they have threatened to stage a walkout from the convention unless further measures to empower the central government are made. The Burgundians have accused the Dutch of hypocrisy, seeking to use centralization to strike at slavery while opposing further economic contributions into the national budget from the rich Northern states which most of them hail from. §RWhile allowing the “Lions” to leave would make it far easier to reform government finances, it would also remove one of the two parties most fiercely opposed to Les Fiducies.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.A;Call their bluff, they wouldn’t dare leave themselves out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG68.B;Some measures of centralization could be adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.T;Old Arcadians Protest Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.D;The Old Arcadians have come out in opposition of plans to transfer powers from the individual republics to the central government. They argue that doing so goes against the Belgian national spirit of freedom and liberty, that such measures would make Arcadian unification less attractive to other nations, and that the issues facing Belgium could be resolved through smaller federal reforms, rather than imposing a unitary system. For these reasons they have threatened to stage a walkout from the convention unless the proposed new Constitution shifts from a unitary to a federal model. Their critics accuse them of attempting to thwart abolition – many Old Arcadians are Southern slaveowners. The situation is complicated further by the fact that the Old Arcadians’ votes would be necessary to reform the national budget from one based on “donations” to standardized revenues. §RAllowing them to leave could doom fiscal reform and thus the ability to build any sort of greater Arcadian state.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.A;Good riddance! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG69.B;Some measures of federalization could be adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.T;The Battle of Rue de Darlan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.D;The original Old Arcadian Club, located in Nouvelle Bruges on the Rue de Darlan, has long held quasi-religious significance for pan-Arcadianists. The Club has also become a meeting place for anti-abolitionists. This morning an argument between some Old Arcadian slaveowning delegates and Dutch-aligned abolitionists outside of the Club evolved into a street brawl. Both sides called upon armed supporters, with Jonge Brigade veterans aiding the Dutch and various street gangs aiding the Old Arcadians. In the confusion, the club caught fire (a popular but disproved myth states that a black abolitionist threw dynamite into the Club), and the brawl only ended when firefighters arrived to contain the blaze. No deaths occurred, but the Club was destroyed, and many Southern delegates have alleged the incident was a Dutch plot and have demanded their expulsion, while the Dutch have argued the inverse. §RExpelling the Lions would strengthen the cause of slavery and Les Fiducies while expelling the Roosters could doom fiscal reform.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.A;All Dutch deputies involved must be arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.B;Expel the Brabantians! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG70.C;This was a tragedy, but we must move forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.T;The Lions Abandon the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.D;Following through on their threat, the isolationists of the Dutch League have departed from the constitutional convention. It seems that our opposition to any form of centralization was unacceptable to them, who accused the Old Arcadians and the Burgundians of “crucifying the nation upon the cross of slavery.” One the one hand, this will make fiscal reform far easier to secure. The northerners of the Lions were some of the strongest opponents to more formal government revenue measures – most southerners allege this was due to not wanting to pay for the slave states’ needs. On the other hand, the Lions were some of the strongest opponents of Les Fiducies. The Dutch League’s self-imposed temporary removal from the political sphere could grant them an opportunity…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG71.A;Just more bitter politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.T;The Arcadians Abandon the Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.D;Following through on their threat, the pan-Arcadians of the Brabantian League have departed from the constitutional convention. It seems that our commitment to centralization was unacceptable to them, who accused the Dutch and the Burgundians of “snuffing out the light of liberty for the sake of bureaucracy.” On the one hand, this has all but removed any threat of Les Fiducies maneuvering a dictator into power and will surely doom the institution of slavery in Belgium. On the other, the Old Arcadians’ votes were critical in breaking the deadlock on fiscal reform and ending the current system of “donations” set by each republic. While no republic has ever refused to contribute revenue to the confederal budget, it seems this topic will not be addressed – and it is almost unthinkable to imagine a unified Arcadia operating under such a system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG72.A;Just more bitter politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.T;The Convention Deadlocks on Fiscal Reform!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.D;The topic of reforming Belgian government finances has caused the convention to grind to a halt. At present, the budget of the Belgian Confederation consists of “donations” from each republic, the amount of which is set by each republic’s own laws. There has not been any case of a republic refusing to contribute money to the confederate budget, but that could change at any time. If we ever want to unite Arcadia under our banner, then we must establish a formal government revenue system. So far, however, a cross-party opposition bloc has prevented such measures. The northerners in the Dutch League don’t want their money going to southern slave states, and the southerners in the Burgundian League don’t want to pay for northern abolitionists. Delegates’ patience is wearing thin, and the matter will soon be brought to a vote for the final time. If we don’t want pan-Arcadianism to die for the sake of petty fiscal politics, then we must offer concessions to the Arcadians and their corporate backers to secure their votes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.A;Offer concessions to the Roosters and Les Fiducies to bring them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG73.B;The “Nons” have it! §R(NO ARCADIAN UNIFICATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.T;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.D;With the Old and the New Arcadians dominating the conference, the last great political battle has emerged : the question of slavery. At this point, anti-slavery sentiment has spread throughout Belgium to the point that defending slavery as a permanent institution is unthinkable for any but the most reactionary politician. However, many corporations have begun to experiment with integrating slaves, either Afro-Franks or rented convicts, into their business models. While many recognize that slavery is a doomed institution in the long run, conservatives have argued that immediate abolition would create even more chaos, not to mention doubting that the confederal government can end slavery where it already exists. They have instead proposed that a deadline be set for all republics to abolish slavery within ninety-nine years.  New Arcadians are horrified at this idea but moderates see it as a way for slavery to “inevitably perish” without upending society. §RLes Fiducies may take action to defend slavery if they are strong enough.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.A;Through bribery, blackmail, and intimidation…ninety-nine years it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG74.B;EIGHT years, and not one hour, one minute, one second more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.T;The Emergency Powers Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.D;With the Burgundians and the Dutch Leagues dominating the conference, the last great political battle has emerged : the question of emergency powers. Article 20 of the current Belgian constitution allows for a state of emergency to be proclaimed by the Stadtholder “in the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution, or if public security is clearly endangered.” The unilateral domestic powers given to the Stadtholder in this scenario effectively enables them to become a temporary dictator. While the States-General is in theory able to end the state of emergency at any time, many liberals see the article as too dangerous. The Burgundians have defended the measure as a precaution against insurrection. The Dutch League demands the measure’s abolition, but they recognize the danger of secession. Therefore, their solution is nothing less than a fully unitary government! While a radical view, it would remove most abilities of the states to resist Nouvelle Bruges, for better or for worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.A;We will not abandon the traditions of our forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG75.B;Time for some truly arcane maneuvering…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.T;The Rooster State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the Old Arcadians have triumphed. Their vision of a decentralized, traditionalist nation carried the day, as did their aspirations of continental unity. It is their hope that this is merely another step towards the final consolidation of Arcadia under Belgian leadership. While it is true that the confederal government may have concerning limits placed upon its power compared to the republics, the Brabantians are confident that the republics will safeguard our liberty. That they will do so in a land of master and slave is, for now, irrelevant. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation look towards the future with the anticipation of those who know that true greatness is still yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG76.A;It’s morning again in Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.T;A New Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the New Arcadians have triumphed. Their vision of a federalized, progressive nation carried the day, as did their aspirations of continental unity. At long last, the old party system has been shattered, and a new generation of radical liberals are rising to the fore! Scorning the Old Arcadians’ notions that unity could only come to Arcadia through stolid reaction and the power of the wealthy elite, they seek to build an equal, equitable, and just nation, for all people. The upcoming abolition of slavery has further energized the egalitarian spirit which is now being reborn amongst our people. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation find a new sense of hope and aspiration stirring within them, animating them to strive for a glorious future which transcends our petty divisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG77.A;Yes, we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.T;Past and Future United;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.D;The eleventh constitutional convention has come to a close, and the Burgundians have triumphed. Their vision of a centralized, conservative nation carried the day, placing the concerns of the Belgian nation over high-minded notions of continental unification. A new era of Belgian nationalism is dawning, one which is driving our people to unite around our commonalities and work for the collective betterment of our communities and our country. The republics and the confederal government, rather than force one side to sacrifice its interests, have reached a state of symbiotic equilibrium. Some mourn the loss of Belgium’s role as a candidate to lead the continent, but the Burgundians argue that leadership is perfectly possible without compromising who and what we are. As the ink dries upon the new Belgian constitution, the delegates and the nation are reassured at the notion that the future shall remain familiar, yet also be filled with wonderful possibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG78.A;We stand today on the edge of a new frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.T;The Self-Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.D;There was simply too much opposition from various localists to enshrine a truly unitary system. Thus, in a moment of supreme irony, the Dutch League turned to Article 20. During a lull in debate, the Stadtholder and the Dutch leaders slipped out. They raced to the Stadtholder’s residence, where the Stadtholder – armed with evidence of bribery and sabotage of crucial legislation by state legislatures, their (non-Dutch) officials, and corporate backers, which the League had intended to present before the convention was called – signed two acts. The first was to declare a state of emergency. The second was to declare the Dutch draft of the constitution adopted. Upon hearing of this, convention delegates suspended debate and decamped to the States-General to demand an end to the (now illegal) dictatorship, but government pamphlets with the incriminating evidence were being distributed around the city. The “four-hour dictatorship” has ushered in a radical new era, and the delegates and the nation embrace the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG79.A;Our long national nightmare is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.T;The Formation of the National Corporate Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.D;The growing influence of Les Fiducies threatens to overwhelm the government. In order to avert a coup, the Old Arcadian League has devised a measure to redirect their aspirations for power into a more legitimate institution. The National Corporate Council has been created to act as an official intermediary between the nation’s major corporations and the government. Chaired by representatives of the nine largest corporations in Belgium, the NCC will advise the Stadtholder and the States-General on drafting legislation and provide an official forum for corporations to lobby the government. Though the NCC’s creation has been severely criticized for opening the door to oligarchy, the Brabantians have countered that, on the contrary, it eliminates the danger of corporations seeking to assault Belgian democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG80.A;The business of the Belgian government is business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG81.T;The Business Plot and the Ste. Claire Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG81.D;Last week a veteran named Leopold Salan led some followers in an attempt to seize a hotel in Nouvelle Bruges. Police stopped him but Salan’s cryptic statements while in custody led detectives to his home in Port Valois. What they discovered was nothing less than evidence of a conspiracy by Old Arcadians and Les Fiducies to overthrow the government and establish a dictatorship! A committee led by famous ideologue Leon Ste. Claire is now holding hearings in which the Old Arcadians and business leaders are devouring each other, naming names, and listing off all manner of depravities. Corruption, secret investments in plantations, arming Jonge Brigades, street gangs used as strikebreakers…The national outrage has allowed Ste. Claire to lead a bill bearing his name through the States-General. Not only does it immediately abolish forced labor (even as punishment for a crime), but major corporations have been nationalized. As waves of arrests are carried out nationwide, Les Fiducies lie dead at the feet of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG81.A;§RIn our hands is held a power greater than their hoarded gold!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN1.T;The Sioux Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN1.D;The fertile plains of central Arcadia have long been inhabited by various native tribes, with the Sioux being some of the most famous. The distance of these places from the power centers of the various Arcadian states has long prevented any of them from taking control of the region. Decades ago, in the aftermath of the war with Plantagenia, a commission was set up to delineate the frontier between Scandinavian Arcadia and Plantagenia. This was accomplished but the claims have long been merely theoretical. However, Plantagenian settlers continue to approach the area, far faster than we will be able to establish settlements there. If we cannot come to an agreement soon then we may lose control of the region entirely. Thus, we are going to arrange a diplomatic meeting with Plantagenia to decide upon the border. While we hope that Plantagenia will see reason and recognize our rightful claim to the Sioux lands it is probable that we will have to compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN1.A;But hopefully we will not have to compromise too much…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.T;The Sioux Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.D;The fertile plains of central Arcadia have long been inhabited by various native tribes, with the Sioux being some of the most famous. Various colonial powers such as Scandinavia and the Dual Monarchy made conflicting claims to the region, and we have inherited this problem. As settlers continue to flow northwards from Oumessourita towards the Sioux lands, we have come into conflict with Scandinavia, who has protested due to the decades-old preliminary border agreement in the region. Now they have come seeking a firmer revision, trying to lay claim to most of the Sioux lands. We should be considerate about how we respond. Some have suggested that we counter by demanding the southern part of their Indian protectorate but we could simply refuse to accept any Scandinavian claims in the region at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.A;Make the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN2.B;We will not compromise with European imperialists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.T;Plantagenia Makes a Counterproposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.D;The Cadiens were not pleased by our assertion of our claim to the Sioux lands, but they have not rejected it outright. Rather, they have set forth a condition for recognizing it : receiving the southwestern portion of the Skraelingr Territory. This region has seen considerable activity by Plantagenian Jesuit missionaries, and many tribes have converted to Catholicism – many, but not all, and it would be untrue to say that any native sees themselves as a Plantagenian. We might be able to convince them to reduce their demands by offering them half of their desired territory, which would still be a considerable gain for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.A;This is a steep price but still a reasonable one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN3.B;Try to bargain them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.T;The Illimark Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.D;The Scandinavians decided to be unexpectedly reasonable, and allowed us to receive southern Illimark from their Indian protectorate in exchange for recognizing their Sioux claims. We had expected its integration to be straightforward, given the prior work of Jesuit missionaries in the region. This has not been the case. The native peoples possess surprisingly dense communities which will not be easy to…shift, to clear the way for settlers. Furthermore, while some of them are Catholics, a considerable amount are not, and these Indians have initiated considerable resistance against the expansion of our administration into the area. We are already having to reassign units from the Belgian border to keep the area pacified. §RThis overextension may have consequences if we go to war with the Belgians.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN4.A;I’m sure that it won’t be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.T;Scandinavia Makes a Counterproposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.D;The Scandinavians were willing to entertain our demands for part of Illimark in exchange for recognizing their Sioux claims, but resisted the idea of splitting the whole region with us. They have instead proposed that we merely annex the southern section of our desired territories from their Indian protectorate. While more bellicose ministers do not want us to back down, accepting this offer would allow us to acquire the most easily integrable part of the Indian lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN5.B;Half of half of Illimark is no deal at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.T;Plantagenia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.D;We have come to an agreement with the Cadiens regarding the Sioux lands. Though we have had to sacrifice part of the Skraelingr Confederacy in order to do it, hopefully these new western lands will prove worth the trade in the long run. We have heard rumors of the Plantagenians planning to enslave the non-Catholic Indians in their new lands, but hopefully these are just rumors…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN6.A;We shall rule the Sioux wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.T;A Lost Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.D;Our efforts to come to an agreement with Plantagenia regarding the Sioux lands have failed. Neither side was able to present a proposal which satisfied the other. It seems that the only thing which will determine the central Arcadia border is whichever nations’ settlers arrive there first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN7.A;The Sioux are now at Plantagenia’s mercy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN8.T;The Nova Lisboa Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN8.D;News has arrived from the Viceroyalty of New Spain of an attack on a northern frontier town by Apache natives. The Apaches are a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe which inhabit the region known to Spaniards as Apacheria and the Plantagenians as Cymrie. Their mastery of mounted warfare has enabled them to carve out a vast swath of territory for themselves in the wild lands of southern Central Arcadia. Now an Apache raiding party has assaulted the town of Nova Lisboa, located in northern Lusitania. Many of the town’s horses were stolen by the raiders, with other goods taken as well, and more than a few residents died defending their community. The attack has caused many colonial officials in the Viceroyalty of New Spain to push for us to bring order to Apacheria by annexing it. The main risk in doing so is inviting challenge from the Cadiens over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN9.T;The Nova Lisboa Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN9.D;News has arrived from Lusitania of an attack on a northern frontier town by Apache natives. The Apaches are a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe which inhabit the region known to Colombians as Apacheria and the Plantagenians as Cymrie. Their mastery of mounted warfare has enabled them to carve out a vast swath of territory for themselves in the wild lands of southern Central Arcadia. Now an Apache raiding party has assaulted the town of Nova Lisboa, located in northern Lusitania.

ARCGEN11.T;The Cymrie Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN11.D;The region of Cymrie is inhabited by the Apaches, a ferocious, warlike nomadic tribe whose mastery of mounted warfare has enabled them to carve out a vast swath of territory for themselves in the wild lands of southern Central Arcadia. The region was claimed by both the Dual Monarchy and Spain and now we have inherited this point of contention. It seems that a recent Apache attack on northern Lusitania has driven $FROM$ to launch a substantial military expedition to crush the so-called “Empire of the Plains” once and for all. We are rapidly mobilizing our own expedition to attempt to steal a march on them, but it will be difficult. §BIf we have allocated resources to keeping the western border supplied, then we should be able to launch our own attack to intercept them and force them to recognize our own claim. However if we have not done so then they will likely succeed in dealing enough damage to the Apaches to secure at least theoretical control over Cymrie.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN11.A;Saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.T;Cymrie is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.D;With swift notice and plenty of cavalry at their disposal, our western garrisons were able to martial a flying column to head west and intercept the Hispanic settlers and their military guards. After a tense standoff, the Hispanics turned back, effectively surrendering all their claims to Cymrie. While our sovereignty over the region is no longer contested by our southern neighbors, we still must break the Apaches and bring our enlightened rule to the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN12.A;The danger has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.T;Cymrie is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.D;Our western garrisons struggled to bring together enough spare men and resources to be able to launch an expedition. By the time that they finally set out and reached central Cymrie, they found the Hispanic settlers already well-established, with a military guard protecting their nascent towns. Rather than provoke an all-out war, our forces had to withdraw. Worst of all, the expedition suffered a disease outbreak on its return home, and more than a few men died without even seeing combat. The whole affair has been shameful, and we have lost any ability to claim Cymrie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN13.A;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.T;Apacheria is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.D;The Plantagenians had been keeping a close eye on the west for years, and they already had their forces in position to make a move when news reached them of our own expedition. They rapidly dispatched a flying column of cavalry ahead of a hastily organized initial group of settlers, seeking to head off our own forces. By the time that our men reached central Apacheria, the Cadiens had already set up rudimentary defenses in the region and greeted our convoy under arms. Rather than risk provoking an all-out war, we were forced to withdraw. Plantagenia is now in firm control of Apacheria, and our only consolation is that they are rumored to be quite ignorant of the true danger posed by the brutal Apaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN14.A;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.T;Apacheria is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.D;Our forces were able to enter Apacheria without much resistance, encountering no sign of any Plantagenians. After resupplying several settler communities and heading further towards the interior, they finally came face to face with a Plantagenian military expedition. However, our superior numbers and prepared defenses convinced the Cadiens that it was not worth fighting us, and they withdrew after a tense standoff. This means that Plantagenia has effectively surrendered all their claims to Apacheria. While our sovereignty over the region is no longer contested by the Cadiens, we still must break the Apaches and bring our enlightened rule to Central Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN15.A;The danger has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.T;The Apache Moon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.D;“As I was preparing for bed, I turned to the window to take one last look at the full moon, and beheld it like a floating pearl. Suddenly, a hellish cry shook me from my reverie. I thought it was a coyote until it was joined by many more. In an instant they were upon the town, a whole host of Apache braves. Some had not even a shirt, but all were armed and rode their horses with the ease of veterans. All able-bodied men grabbed our guns and leapt to the town’s defense. In a brutal exchange, no more than five minutes, it was accomplished, but they made off with a great bounty, including many horses. One month later, like clockwork, the full moon rose again, and brought the Apaches back with it…”\n\nOur frontier settlements in the land of the Apaches are under siege. Any settler traveling a significant distance must travel in a group or risk being taken by vengeful Indians. Whole towns are facing night raids, worst of all being the dreaded “Apache Moon,” when veritable armies of natives sweep across the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN16.A;Damn those Indians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.T;The End of the Apache Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.D;Several years ago, new inventions made tanning buffalo hides far easier and thus more profitable, leading to its near-eradication by commercial hunters from $COUNTRY$. This created an existential crisis among the Apache, who resolved to fight the hunter-settlers and the military patrols backing them. A series of attacks against settler outposts by the Apaches caused $COUNTRY$ to dispatch over a thousand troops to seize the Apaches’ safe havens and force them to abandon nomadism. The Apaches tried to string the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers along on an endless chase across the region. However, the ruthless scorched-earth policies of $COUNTRY$ soon caused the Apaches to run low on food and horses. The Battle of the Stockaded Plains saw the Apaches under their leader Cochise finally stand their ground and attempt to destroy their pursuers by catching them at dawn. While $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces sustained several casualties, the Apaches lost the battle and thus the war. By the end of $YEAR$, the “Apache Empire” was ashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN17.A;The Apache Moon shall rise no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.T;A Meeting of the National Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.D;The National Council of the Skraelingr Territories was formed to allow all of the major tribes within our lands to have representation, but it is widely criticized. Presided over by a Scandinavian representative, the Council’s actual legislative abilities are few. Moreover, the process by which tribes are allotted representatives is frequently revised by Copenhagen, and several tribes which are large enough to merit increased representation simply are left out for political reasons. Worst of all, the Iroquois continue to be overrepresented within the Council, reflecting their status as the Scandinavian’s primary collaborator. All of this means that the Council often struggles to even make it through its day-to-day business, let alone address crises. The worst part is that it is one of the most democratic and native-supporting systems in Euro-Arcadian society – the bar is just that low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN18.A;This is not the best way to run a nation…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.T;The Jesuits of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.D;Ever since the Dual Monarchy pushed its colonial boundaries into the Arcadian hinterland in the 17th century, Catholic missionaries have been a recurring sight across the Misizipi and Ohio river valleys. Now Plantagenia has sent the Society of Jesus, or simply the Jesuits, to assist us in educating our people. The Jesuits are known for integrating into a target community to better evangelize them, seeking both to convert non-Christians and bring non-Catholics into the Roman fold. This, along with their insular nature, leads many to heap accusations of conspiracy against them. Though most of these are too wild to take seriously, a concerning number of southern Illimarkers have accepted Catholicism, much to the dismay of Scandinavian Protestant missionaries. §RWhile they are strengthening our literacy they might also lead to cultural divergence and even separatism amongst the southerners.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.A;Any education assistance is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN19.B;Impose strict surveillance and force out any charismatic priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Due to Plantagenia’s annexation of southern Illimark, we have little ability to resist this development, and conflicts between Catholic converts and older Protestant communities are already emerging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN20.A;At least they are building up our literacy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN21.T;The Kattefolket Sikariere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN21.D;Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths, but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies. A new religious movement amonge the Kattefolket of the southeast may change this. The believers have been called the “Sikariere,” after the Jewish religious militants of ancient times who sought to drive the Romans from their lands. Their leader, Tarhe (also known as “The Great Crane”), fancies himself a religious prophet. Inspired by a series of visions which he claims to have received last year, he has begun preaching a strange faith which blends elements of Protestant Christianity with beliefs from many different Iroquoian tribes. The main tenets of “Sikarierism” are temperance, community solidarity, and rejection of European culture. He has begun to attract quite a following, much to the alarm of the Europeans amongst us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN21.A;I doubt that it is much to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.T;Decline of the Fur Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.D;The fur trade has always been a cornerstone of the native Arcadian economy. The arrival of the Europeans, however, turned it into a massive enterprise which drove unprecedented levels of conflict amongst the tribes to supply the lucrative European market. The Iroquois became particularly known for their bellicose attitude towards their rivals in the fur trade. However, the trade has suffered from overhunting, as well as the growth of other fur sources in Hokkaigan, Qingqiu, Siberia, and eastern Europe. A group of Iroquois tribes are now planning to press the Scandinavian authorities to recognize them as the official representatives of fur traders within the Territory. They cite not only their tribe’s long history as the preeminent fur traders in the region, but the efficiency of routing the trade through only one group. While this would be highly lucrative, it would also outrage the Vinlandic traders, not to mention all of the non-Iroquois tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.A;The Iroquois succeed in becoming fur trade hegemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN22.B;The Vinlandic colonial government blocks the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.T;“On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.D;A recent book has brought the culture of the Kanien'kéha (Mohawk) people to Belgian attention. Henrik Costeau’s “On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government” is the result of three years of research, with Costeau having traveled throughout the northeastern Skraelingr Territory to compile his information. The work is a shameless courting of public scandal and infamy, with Costeau making many exaggerations and distortions of Kanien'kéha culture in the name of luridness (particularly his illustrations of Kanien'kéha women). The worst part of it all is that, even with such unprofessional presentation, the work still represents an expansion of Euro-Arcadian knowledge of the Kanien'kéha and of the Skraelingr Territory in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN23.A;And they think that WE are the ignorant savages?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.T;“On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.D;A recent book has brought the culture of the Mohawk Indians of the west to Belgian attention. Henrik Costeau’s “On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government” is the result of three years of research, with Costeau having traveled throughout the northeastern Skraelingr Territory to compile his information. The work has proven somewhat scandalous, as Costeau goes into rather lurid detail about the customs of the Mohawk and his time amongst them, with accompanying illustrations. The tone of the work is also far from academic, with a sardonic tone that sensationalizes elements of “primitive” Mohawk culture. Costeau’s use of controversial sciences such as phrenology in discussing the Mohawk have drawn criticism as well. The work’s defenders argue that the book is still an improvement over prior Mohawk scholarship, and has revealed that the Skraelingr are far more complicated than anyone suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN24.A;The pictures of the women seem particularly popular…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.T;The Legacy of Emil Krag;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.D;Emil Krag was a half-Cree, half-Vinlandic author and political activist who led the Revolution of 1827 against the Vinlandic colonial government and its Scandinavian overlords. While unsuccessful, he has become a martyr both for liberals and for native Arcadians. Krag is seen by some as the manifestation of the liberal ideal, someone who walked in both the European and the native Arcadian cultural worlds without totally immersing himself within either. Though reactionary native peoples see Krag as a Vinlandic figure without relevance to the Great Lakes, younger men of many tribes look up to Krag as an inspirational, revolutionary figure to be emulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN25.A;He is our hero, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.T;The Vinlandic Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.D;The reports from the north are clear : the Crown Colony of Vinland has ceased to exist. In its place a new and independent Vinlandic state has arisen, and Scandinavia’s influence in Arcadia has evaporated. Unfortunately, our “nation” was largely a Scandinavian construction, and our government and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped. Now, many tribes are agitating for independence, and the entire Great Lakes region risks dissolving into factionalism and separatism. With swift and decisive action from the government (such as it is), we might be able to hold things together, at least for the short term. But how should we couch our rhetoric to keep the nation together? Should we focus on dissuading radicalism and awaiting further developments, or seeking to rally the people behind a bold new future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.A;We must keep calm and act with caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN26.B;The hour of our freedom is at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.T;Vinlandic Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.D;For centuries, Vinland has been Scandinavia’s main route to exert influence amongst us. Thus it was with shock that our citizens awoke this morning to realize that we are now officially estranged from both Scandinavia and Vinland. Unfortunately, our “nation” was largely a Scandinavian construction, and our government and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped. Now, many tribes are agitating for independence, and the entire Great Lakes region risks dissolving into factionalism and separatism. This cannot be allowed! At long last, we finally have the freedom to forge our own destiny. We shall rally the people behind a bold new future and achieve unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN27.A;Good riddance to all colonizers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.T;The Skraelingr Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.D;The end of the Sanacomie War threatens to drive both the Belgian Confederacy and Plantagenia to turn towards the Skraelingr lands, now that they are no longer preoccupied with fighting one another. The autonomous status of the Skraelingr puts them in danger, but they have hitherto strongly resisted integration owing to fears of becoming just another colony. The liberal Vinlandic regime, however, has instilled a newfound level of cautious trust among leading Skraelingr officials and influential chiefs. While Vinlandic and Skraelingr representatives are still working out the details, we may be able to unite our nations together to ward off the Belgian and Plantagenian threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN28.A;Let us hope that they work swiftly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.T;Birth of the Federal Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.D;After round after round of discussions between Vinlandic officials and tribal authorities, it has been decided that the Skraelingr Territory concept proved unworkable. A wholly artificial Scandinavian construct from the very beginning, there was no way to maintain it within our nation while ensuring full representation to all the tribes. Therefore, the entire system has been eliminated, and replaced with federal territories adjusted for each major tribal group involved. Rather than vesting power in this or that group over another, the federal territories will allow each community to protect its culture within our national framework. This will, of course, only be extended to the ex-Skraelingr tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN29.A;Another broken system replaced by enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.T;The Great Skraelingr Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.D;When we announced the incorporation of the Skraelingr lands, we expected resistance from the natives, but nothing too substantial – after all, the Territory is an artificial construct barely holding itself together, with no cultural foundation to unify it. It seems that our judgment was incorrect. A charismatic native preacher named Tarhe has led the growth of a syncretic faith incorporating Christian, Iroquois, and Algonquin religious elements – and he has not taken our actions lying down. His “Sikariere,” as the believers are known, have taken up arms against us. Many natives who are not particularly zealous have still flocked to the movement, seeing it as the main form of resistance to our rule. Now the Sikariere have overrun the Skraelingr government and declared full independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN30.A;Crush those mad heathen savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.T;Triumph over Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.D;The holy book of the Christians tells that the two greatest prophets were Moses and Jesus, one who came to rescue his people, the other to redeem all people. The faith and traditions of the native peoples tell of many heroes and sages of their own. But, surely, one has now risen above all others : the Prophet Tarhe, Praised Be His Holy Name! The Great Crane has led our crusade to victory over the infidels. As our sacred hosts of holy warriors sweep across the north, all our indigenous kindred are being liberated from their servitude and restored to their old lands. Righteous vengeance shall be inflicted upon all the decadent cities of the east, and all false idols cast down. Across the world, heretic and heathen alike are confounded and astonished by our triumph. Let the pillars of Hell tremble, for the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth is soon to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN31.A;§RGOD IS GREAT! GOD IS GREAT!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.T;The Last of the Skraelingr;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.D;There was an idea, created in Copenhagen but born out in Arcadia : an idea of the Skraelingr, of the Great Lakes and all of their tribes brought together within a single government. That notion – that political reality – has been murdered. It has perished on a dozen battlefields, it has burned with a hundred villages, it has slipped into the sky from a thousand wailing, mournful cries of mothers, daughters, and sisters who shall never see their sons, fathers, and brothers again. The Vinlandic government has broken up all major native communities, forcing them to congregate in a small area known simply as the Consolidated Lands. All the rest of their domain has been placed in the trust of the Vinlandic administration, to be sold off or allotted as they see fit. Tens of thousands of natives are being driven from their homes, never to return. Many will not even reach the Consolidated Lands. The emaciated, diseased, despairing survivors shall be the last of the Skraelingr.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN32.A;Every trail has its end, and every calamity brings its lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.T;Vinland Rebuked;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.D;God is great! We have repelled the Vinlandic infidels and safeguarded our holy nation. Despite their haughty dispositions and so-called “advanced” technologies, they proved no match for our valorous crusaders and their indomitable resolve. Their invasion’s humiliating failure left their tyrannical leader with no choice but to recognize our sacred realm as a free and independent nation. Let the vile northerners suffer and rot in their den of iniquity. We shall live, free and blessed, within our New Jerusalem, under the wise hand of the Prophet Tarhe, Praise Be His Holy Name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN33.A;Zion stands unconquered and unbowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.T;A Struggle in the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.D;The end of foreign rule has opened the floodgates of political discourse across our nation, and the matter has reached the National Council itself. The only thing that most citizens can agree on is that we must embrace some sort of unifying policy to prevent total dissolution. It is tempting to take this opportunity to curtail all foreign influences and focus on internal development, establishing a parliamentary republic and a federal system to ensure democracy. This might leave us vulnerable, however, which is why others advocate a confederal system guided by a strong head of state and a more engaging foreign policy. The Sikariere on the council have made their own recommendations for a theocratic regime, and strange as it may sound they have accumulated a noteworthy following amongst the people. Where shall the future of the Skraelingr lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.A;Federalism and republicanism will keep us safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.B;We need a confederation with a strong president and military!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN34.C;The Great Crane shall guide us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.T;The Jesuit Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.D;We had allowed the Jesuits into our nation in good faith, on the grounds of giving both Protestant and Catholic missionaries equal treatment. That trust has now been violated by the machinations of Plantagenia. A revolt has now been organized in the southwest, in which the tribes of the region – who have largely converted to Catholicism – have requested Plantagenian “protection!” We cannot be certain of how many Jesuits were in on the scheme, or whether they orchestrated it voluntarily or were intimidated by the Plantagenians, but that doesn’t matter right now. As of this moment all authority in the southwest has collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN330.A;This is TREASON!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.T;Creation of the Four Fires Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.D;In a completely unexpected turn of events, the major tribes of the southwestern Skraelingr have declared independence under the banner of the Four Fires Council. It just so happens that many of them have converted to Catholicism under the influence of the Jesuits amongst them. As we all know, the Indians of the Great Lakes are heathen savages, so it wouldn’t be right to leave fellow Catholics to their mercy. The only humane thing to do is to take them under our wing and “protect” them. A Plantagenian military detachment has already departed for their capital to…arrange the terms of this protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN340.A;It’s for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN35.T;The Jesuit Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN35.D;We had allowed the Jesuits into our nation in good faith, on the grounds of giving both Protestant and Catholic missionaries equal treatment. It seems that trust was a dangerous policy. Word has reached us from sympathetic citizens that pro-Plantagenian elements of the Jesuits were involved in a scheme to foment separatism amongst the southwestern Catholics! Thankfully, it seems that Plantagenia did not coordinate well with their supposed agents, nor did the agents keep the plan sufficiently secret. Edicts have already been promulgated expelling the Jesuits from our nation. This has caused some minor unrest amongst the Catholics but nowhere near the amount of danger which could have arisen had the Cadien plot succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARGEN35.A;I always knew that those Jesuits were up to something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.T;Failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.D;Our plans to engineer the secession of the southwestern Indian lands have been thwarted! It seems that the Jesuits suffered from both internal infighting over the morality of our actions, and a lack of secrecy – at least one of their native conspirators betrayed them and confessed the plot to the authorities. Now, the entire Jesuit Society has been expelled by the Skraelingr, and all separatist sentiments crushed. Furthermore, a wave of anti-Jesuit and to an extent anti-Catholic hysteria is now ripping through the Skraelingr. Not only are those lands now beyond our reach save by use of direct force, but we have poisoned our relations with the Skraelingr for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN36.A;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.T;Confederal Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.D;Our government has struggled to hold itself together since we were thrust into independence. Now even that desperate endeavor has ended. News of Belgian forces crossing the eastern border ignited an inextinguishable blaze of chaos across our lands. Various tribes have declared independence or even sought protection from Vinland to save themselves from the wrath of the Belgians. Our nation has crumbled before our very eyes. Nobody can say what the future of the Great Lakes will be, but it is now obvious that the Skraelingr as a united people will not play a part in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN37.A;Our people are no more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.T;The Four Fires Council Requests Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.D;The Belgian invasion of the Skraelingr triggered the collapse of their nation. It seems that they were even less united than many had supposed. Now, with various tribes free to feud with one another as the northerners pick over the Skraelingr corpse, the southwestern Catholic tribes have come together. Establishing a smaller federation known as the Four Fires Council, they have petitioned us for military protection. The Council has offered to surrender control of its foreign affairs to us as a condition of said arrangement. This is a splendid opportunity and we have no reason to refuse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN38.A;Of course we shall protect our fellow Catholics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.T;The Scramble for the Iroquois;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.D;The collapse of the Skraelingr nation has caused the Iroquois, formerly the most economically influential component of the Skraelingr, to return to independence. However, they hold lands which both our nation and our neighbor have long coveted. They have expressed no interest in arranging a formal division of the Iroquois territory. Thus, we are now competing for whomever can compel the Iroquois to capitulate first. To the victor goes the Iroquois nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN39.A;The race is on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.T;The War of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.D;Nobody amongst our government was under any illusion that the settlers at our borders would leave us alone. Now, the Belgians have decided to strike. Their leader recently gave a pompous speech full of hollow and mean phrases which can be summarized as their brutish attempt to lay claim to our ancestral lands. Now we are faced with a hard choice. It is possible that we might be able to concede only part of their desired territories and persuade them to be satisfied with just a piece of our eastern lands. It would be a painful parting but it would spare both of us bloodshed. The alternative is to stand and fight. While no doubt the honorable and valorous choice, Belgium is a strong and wealthy country, and it is unlikely that we could defeat them. But, do we not owe our ancestors one final show of defiance to our enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.A;We shall not go gentle into the dark night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN40.B;True courage makes sacrifices for peace, not war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.T;The Belgians Invade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.D;When we concluded our latest treaty with the Belgians, there were those amongst our people who said that we were being foolish – that the Belgians would never be satisfied with the lands that they acquired. Those fears have now been proven accurate. The Belgians have crossed into our lands once again, and this time they have vowed not to stop until our entire nation comes under their dominion. Now, we must ride out to face them – to face our destiny, whatever it may be. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN43.A;History shall tell that we died standing rather than live kneeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.T;The Skraelingr are Under Siege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN44.D;For well over a century, the Belgians have coveted the notion of westward expansion into the Skraelingr lands. Now that the natives are vulnerable, they have seized the opportunity to strike. Judging by their rhetoric, they seem set on conquering as much of the Skraelingr as they can. Therefore, we have only a limited window of opportunity to act, or else lose them forever to the Belgians. Some see the entirety of the Great Lakes as our own natural frontier and want us to demand an immediate end to the Belgian invasion, threatening war if they refuse. Others believe that the Belgians could be made to negotiate and agree on a division of the lands with us. A few determined pacifists simply do not want to get involved.

ARCGEN45.T;Vinland Threatens Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.D;Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. Vinland has presented an ultimatum : End our current war immediately, or else they shall intervene on the side of the Skraelingr. While it is unclear if they possess the military might to enforce such a threat, few members of our government relish the thought of a two-front war. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time to mull over our response : the Vinlanders demand an immediate reply. What shall we answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.A;We’ll see you on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN45.B;We have no choice but to acquiesce…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.T;A Partition Agreement with Vinland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.D;Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. The Vinlanders have approached us, privately, to offer an arrangement regarding the Great Lakes. Under the terms of the proposed secret treaty, our two nations would partition the Skraelingr roughly in half along a north-south line, with Vinland keeping the north and ourselves the south. The resulting borders seem fair, and our military must have made an impression on the Vinlanders for them to offer a division of the Indian lands rather than seek to keep us out of them entirely. Still, we are under no obligations to accept, but they may declare war if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.A;It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN46.B;We will not compromise on our manifest destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.T;The Vinlandic Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.D;The ruling classes of Vinland have always treated us with paternalistic high-handedness, and we have never forgotten their foreign nature. Few amongst us, however, predicted this latest, brutal development. Vinland, in the name of “safeguarding” the tribes of the north, has marched its armies into our hinterlands! Worse, we have received reports of Vinlandic and Belgian troops cooperating in the field! With our entire focus on the Belgian front we have little hope of preventing this vile deception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN47.A;Fratricide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.T;The Belgians Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.D;Our proposal was approved by the Belgian government. With our forces already heading south to occupy our allotted lands, we should expect resistance from the Skraelingr but nothing that we cannot handle. Few people within our government enjoy the prospect of the Belgians seizing the southern lands, but at least we shall be able to preserve the northern Great Lakes for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN48.A;Now to make it official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.T;The Belgians have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.D;Our proposal was denied by the greedy Belgians. They have asserted that the lands of the Great Lakes shall be theirs and theirs alone! If we wish to prevent this, then war is our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.A;Then let battle be joined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN49.B;We must accept the new Arcadian order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.T;The Skraelingr Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.D;The Vinlandic government has surprised many indigenous peoples across Arcadia with its relatively humane and tolerant treatment of natives, at least in comparison to its contemporaries. Their administration is far from perfect, but their conciliatory stance on native rights by all accounts appears to be genuine. Thus, a sense of cautious optimism has begun sweeping our people, who are now wondering if we might be able to find a place of equal standing beside the Vinlanders. A new law is now being voted on by the National Council. If passed, then we shall formally petition Vinland for annexation. Due to their laws on the protection of native cultures, it is hoped that we would be able to preserve both our traditions and our lands while enjoying the economic and political fruits of Vinlandic citizenship. The votes are tallied, and…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.A;The jas have it! §R(AUTO-ANNEXATION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN50.B;The neis have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.T;The Skraelingr Petition for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.D;Our sweeping protection of native rights have been hailed amongst the Skraelingr as a new chapter in Arcadian history. A mood of Vinland pan-nationalism is sweeping the Skraelingr, who are beginning to accept what we ourselves have always known to be true : that Vinland is their best and most responsible steward. Now a formal request has been received from their National Council, requesting their annexation into our nation! This request was, of course, conditioned on the granting of cultural and land rights to the Skraelingr, terms which our administration is more than happy to accept. This is a tremendous victory and further enshrines Vinland as the standard bearer of Arcadian unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN51.A;What are we waiting for? We accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.T;Vinland Annexes the Skraelingr;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.D;Our plan to engineer the secession of the southwestern Catholic tribes of the Skraelingr has failed in an unexpected way. It appears that the radical Vinlandic government bent so far backwards to appease the Indians that they joined their nation voluntarily! Many of our officials are in disbelief at this turn of events, muttering of coups and bribes, but as of now, the entirety of the Great Lakes region is now Vinlandic territory. Our efforts amongst the Catholics of the south have come to naught. The only bright spot is that the Vinlanders seem unaware of our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN52.A;What a waste…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.T;A Border Treaty with Vinland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.D;Our ownership of Potomimark has disquieted Vinland, who feel as though we have occupied a dangerous amount of former Skraelingr land. They have now proposed a treaty that would condone our occupation of more southernly lands in exchange for ceding Potomimark to them. If we accept, then this will likely put an end to our border conflicts with Vinland. §RIt would also prevent us from claiming further Skraelingr lands in the future. If we intend to pursue a greater Arcadian destiny, however, then we may want to avoid making such a bitter enemy of Vinland, lest they take advantage of a future moment of our weakness to enact vengeance.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.A;This seems like a fair compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN53.B;We fought for these lands, and they are ours and ours alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN54.D;Our ownership of Eriesland has created friction with Belgium, who are greatly desirous of access to the Great Lakes. They have now proposed a treaty that would ratify our ownership of the western Skraelingr lands in exchange for ceding Eriesland to them, to avoid war over the issue in the future. If we accept, then this will likely put an end to our border conflicts with Belgium. §RIt is tempting to flatly refuse this request on principle – it would mean permanently losing control of Eriesland - but it may not be wise to make a bitter enemy out of the Belgians.§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN54.A;This seems like a fair compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN56.T;The Arcadian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.D;Now that the New Arcadians have come to power within Belgium, and sorted out most of its internal political divisions, they have approached us regarding incorporation into their own nation. We had seceded alongside the Belgians during the first war with Plantagenia, and now pan-Arcadianism is driving many Louisianais to support Belgian statehood. The culture of Belgium, emphasizing egalitarianism and the value of hard work and personal achievement, is far more attractive than Plantagenia’s elitist aristocracy and slavish Europhilia. The tide of pan-Arcadian nationalism which is now sweeping through our nation has now become too strong to be ignored. It may also be too strong to be denied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.A;We shall dare to dream the Arcadian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN56.B;Louisiane for the Louisianais!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN57.T;The Arcadian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN57.D;Our nation was founded upon the bedrock of absolute independence, but recent events in Belgium have caused certain liberals amongst us to reconsider that notion. The New Arcadians, having come to power in Belgium and sorted out most of its internal political divisions, are now urging us to seriously consider the prospect of unification with their nation. Reactionaries decry the idea of “selling out our homeland, so newly won, to yet more white men,” but the New Arcadians are not typical of their race. They are racial progressives, who count many strident abolitionists – including black abolitionists – within their ranks. Moreover, they have also pushed for greater equality between the races. And if we were to accept unification, our size and status as a free country give us the negotiating power to safeguard our cultural and civil rights. The tide of pan-Arcadian nationalism which is now sweeping through our nation has now become too strong to be ignored. It may also be too strong to bedenied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN58.D;“Men grow tired of sleep, love, singing and dancing sooner than of war.” – Homer\n\nIt had been hoped that the differences of Belgium and Plantagenia were settled when they clashed over Vierset – that the Arcadian War had given both states a path to find a way to live with one another. But the Old Arcadians of Belgium did not want peace : they wanted the absolute submission of their enemies. Now, Plantagenia is rallying their own forces to meet them on the field of battle once again. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be subordinated to the pan-Arcadian dream, another pawn in Belgium’s great game for hegemony. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation. The conclusion of a decades-long vendetta begins now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But the New Arcadians of Belgium have a dream – the Arcadian Dream, the idea of a new and united nation brought forth upon the continent – and they will make any sacrifice to force Plantagenia to accept it. Now, the Cadiens are rallying their own forces to meet them on the field of battle once again. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be subordinated to the pan-Arcadian dream, another pawn in Belgium’s great game for hegemony. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation.

ARCGEN60.D;The Arcadian War, which was presumed to be the final struggle between ourselves and the Belgians, was not so final after all. The Belgian government has fallen into the hands of a clique of bellicose Arcadian pan-nationalists who demand nothing less than the total subjugation of our country! The invasion has evoked a rare sense of unity crossing ideological and class lines. Cadiens rich and poor are setting aside their differences to defend our nation from the northern hordes, as the States General passes an emergency mobilization bill. At stake is Plantagenia’s very nationhood. If – and when – we prevail, then we shall ensure that Belgium will never be able to threaten us, or any other country, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But Belgium could not accept that Plantagenia would ever be a benevolent neighbor, nor could they forgive or forget the injustices visited upon them during Plantagenia’s pursuit of an Arcadian Empire. Now Belgian armies are marching south to deliver final vengeance unto the Cadiens. If Belgium prevails, then Plantagenia will be excoriated beyond hope of recovery. If Plantagenia prevails, however, Belgium as a nation shall perish from the earth. There can be no retreat, no withdrawal, no hesitation.

ARCGEN62.D;The Arcadian War, which was presumed to be the final struggle between ourselves and the Belgians, was not so final after all. The Belgian government has embarked upon a totally unjustified punitive campaign to cripple our nation! The invasion has evoked a rare sense of unity crossing ideological and class lines. Cadiens rich and poor are setting aside their differences to defend our nation from the northern hordes, as the States General passes an emergency mobilization bill.

ARCGEN63.T;Formation of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN63.D;The Belgians entered into war against us under the rather childish delusion that they were going to subjugate everyone, and nobody was going to subjugate them. However, the stabilization of our national politics has begun to evoke a different form of pan-Arcadianism amongst our ruling classes, one built upon solid principles of tradition. Now that the Belgians have been vanquished, we shall give them a taste of their own medicine. A military administration has been formed under Plantagenian control to prepare the lands of the north for integration into a pan-Arcadian state of our own. This is a complex process, as many Belgians are…not excited by the prospect of being subsumed by our country for a second time. Furthermore, guerilla bands have already begun cropping up across the region. More serious is the fact that this massive occupation is proving an enormous strain upon our bureaucracy and treasury. We shall have to quickly consolidate our newfound status as the leader of Arcadian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN63.A;It is time to reconstruct the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN64.T;The Dissolution of the Belgian Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN64.D;The latest war against the Belgians has made it plain that a unified Belgium will always be a threat to the peace and stability of the rest of Arcadia. Therefore, we have taken it upon ourselves to dismantle the Confederacy. Both Basse and Haute Valoise, along with any Belgian-held Iroquois lands, are now under our control. The remaining Belgian states have been restored to their prior sovereignty, and all legal documents which previously bound them have been abrogated by vote of the Belgian States General (with our own soldiers posted outside the building at time of voting). It is not inconceivable that some future generation of northerners may arise to rekindle the flame of Belgian nationalism, but if they do, then we shall stomp it out once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN65.T;Formation of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN65.D;The time has come at last. Plantagenia has been utterly defeated and is ready to be remade in our image. A new administration has been instituted within the Cadien lands, supplied in large part by our own military. It will spread the message of pan-Arcadianism throughout the southern lands and ensure a smooth transition when the time comes to finalize our unification. However, we have received reports of guerilla warfare by both white and black partisans against our forces. Moreover, the occupation of such a vast territory has greatly strained our bureaucracy and our treasury. We shall have to conclude our Arcadian unification plans with the utmost speed or else risk Plantagenia slipping out of our grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN66.D;When our ancestors led the revolution against Plantagenia, they fought for survival against the southern menace. Now it has fallen to us, their descendants, to end any possibility of Plantagenia becoming a threat to Arcadia. Any contested lands held by Plantagenia shall be granted full liberty, reducing them down to their core territories. We have heard rumors that the Louisianais may seek unification with Belgium, but nothing is certain. For now, let us rejoice in the culmination of the effort begun by our revolutionary forefathers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN666.T;The Day of Reckoning;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN666.D;With our catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Belgians, our nation has seen territorial losses on all fronts. We had consoled ourselves with the hope that we could still retain enough plantation lands to keep financially solvent. The long-suffering slaves, however, had other ideas. Seeing their masters laid low to an unprecedented degree, a few free black partisans were emboldened to begin orchestrating local slave revolts. Ordinarily we would have been able to put them down, but the total shattering of our military left us struggling to stamp out even the mere embers of anarchy. Before long, the whole eastern section of our remaining territory was aflame with rebellion. In the chaos, a certain knight disappeared – only to resurface as the head of the black serpent! Sir Louis Lafayette de Saint-Georges – the apparent mastermind of this conspiracy – has been acclaimed leader of this new abomination, this Liberie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN6666.D;The emergence of Louisiane from Plantagenia’s tyrannical grip was joyous news to all Belgians, but none were as happy as the Burgundians. At long last, our program of unification with our southern brothers can now be completed! We have already sent representatives to the Louisianais to guide them through this transitional period. Through friendly negotiation (and perhaps a bit of bribery), the Louisianais government agreed to become our newest state, and a bill to such effect has just been approved by the States-General and signed into law by the Stadtholder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN670.T;Futilité;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN670.D;”This is not peace. It is an armistice for thirty years.” – Belgian General Willem Bosch\n\nA nightmare has descended over Arcadia, as Belgium and Plantagenia have covered their lands in carnage only to fight one another to mutual exhaustion. Both sides finally agreed to meet in Vierset and discuss peace negotiations. To the agony of both powers, the only terms which they were both willing to accept were those of status quo ante bellum. The outrage and despair in both countries, having sacrificed so much for nothing, will imperil political stability within them for years to come – to say nothing of the international embarrassment. The war seems to have extinguished the pan-Arcadian spirit amongst Cadiens, but the mood among Belgians is harder to judge. While the Dutch League is more pacifist now than ever, both the Old and New Arcadians seem to have merely been embittered, and the Burgundians are divided amongst many different views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN670.A;Will the cycle continue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN67.T;Destiny Within Reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN67.D;We are entering the final stages of Arcadian unification. As our administration prepares for the merging of our nations, we must consider the mood across the rest of the continent, chiefly in Vinland and Qingqiu. Our diplomats report that the Qingqiuese are intensely anxious at the prospect of Belgium and Plantagenia merging into a single country, and they shall likely seek some type of border adjustment in the west as a precondition of supporting Arcadian unification. Vinland is less certain : if we have deprived them of lands in the Great Lakes which they saw as rightfully theirs, they shall likely demand their return, but if not then they may acquiesce. §GIn fourteen days, the unification of Arcadia will be announced.§RIf we receive an objection from Qingqiu or Vinland within that time, we must prepare for either compromise or war.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Yet now they are vulnerable, and they currently hold former Skraelingr lands which rightfully belong to us. Now is our last chance to demand the Great Lakes basin in its entirety!

ARCGEN76.D;“It is well that war is so terrible, or else we would grow too fond of it.” – Qingqiuan General Zeng Jidao\n\nThe specter of Arcadian unification proved too much for either Qingqiu or Vinland to stomach. Both powers sought concessions along their frontiers in exchange for supporting Arcadian unification, and both failed. Now the continent is awash with tension as these nations gird themselves for the final clash of the Arcadian titans. One side seeks to bring forth upon the continent a new nation – the other seeks to prevent this at all costs. The Great Lakes and the Mintchicanes Mountains shall be turned red with the blood of tens of thousands, and the latest chapter in Arcadian history shall be just as violent as all which have preceded it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN76.A;§RLet us die to make men free!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN77.T;The Murder of the Arcadian Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN77.D;There will be no unification of Arcadia – the foes of its pan-nationalists have now seen to that. The great cities of Belgium and Plantagenia are smoldering ruins, banners of foreign nations flying above them. The treaty which ended the war – negotiated in, of all places, Vierset – has completely destroyed eastern Arcadia. All of the former Skraelingr Territories have been awarded to Vinland, and various nations have been made independent across the region. Oumessourita has become a Qingqiuan protectorate, and a truncated Plantagenia has had its monarchy forced into exile, and a democratic, abolitionist regime established in its stead. The Nouvel Bruges stock market has been closed for weeks – nobody can bear to watch it crash. The Old and New Arcadian parties are considering dissolution or at least renaming as they no longer have a reason to exist. The Arcadian Dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

All talk amongst the Plantagenian upper classes of pan-Arcadianism has ended – all hope of it is lost. The hopes of Charles II will never rise again. The Arcadian Dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN771.A;The problem with a dream is that you must be asleep to believe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.T;The Oumessouritan Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.D;Now that the easterners have been vanquished, we have secured the region of Oumessouritan as a protectorate. However, the treaty does not stipulate what measures we must take in order to protect it. As our armies are already garrisoning most of its territory, it would be a simple matter to annex it. The only problem which might emerge is the difficulty of directly governing such a vast expanse of land on the other side of the Mingxingshan Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.A;It is a risk that we can afford to take - annex them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN770.B;This is unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN78.T;Pax Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN78.D;Ad astra per aspera! We have overcome all obstacles, vanquished all adversaries, in our unstoppable journey towards Arcadian unification. Neither Vinland, nor Qingqiu, nor any other power in Arcadia or the world has been able to stand against us. Our provisional government in the occupied territories reports that the political situation there is now stable enough for unification to commence. We now stand at the threshold of a new era – the era of Pax Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN78.A;Glory, glory, hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN79.T;A Golden Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN79.D;Oumessourita is currently locked in a struggle against the newly united nation of Arcadia. If Arcadia were to prevail, it would put them uncomfortably close to our heartland. Therefore, we must act now to preserve our frontier. The western part of Oumessourita has long been claimed by our nation, and now, with the Oumessouritans occupied, we can seize control of them. In all likelihood this will cause Oumessourita to fall to Arcadia, but our fait accompli will deny them the ability to lay claim to the lands which we obtain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN79.A;A cunning plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN80.T;The Treaty of Erikshavn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN80.D;With our forces defeated in the field, the Vinlanders compelled our representatives to travel north for peace negotiations. Threatened with full military occupation, we were made to accept a litany of injustices inflicted upon us. Lousiane, Philipine, Basse Valoise, and Nouvel Loraine are all to become independent states, while the Belgian Confederacy as we know it will be dismantled and replaced with a bloated, overextended state of Nouvel Flanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Threatened with full military occupation, we were made to accept a litany of injustices inflicted upon us. The Tsalagihi protectorate is to be made a free and independent state, along with Louisiane and Oumessouritan. The only consolation is that we will be left with enough…agricultural land to run a profit, assuming that the workers labor hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARCGEN82.T;The Honest Truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN82.D;The war situation has proceeded not necessarily to Vinland’s advantage. Arcadia, now that it has emerged as a unified state, is in a position of overwhelming military strength. In terms of population, economy, and army size, they are now thoroughly superior to us. They have thus imposed upon us an onerous “revision” of the borders between our nations which amounts to the unilateral seizure of the former Skraelingr territory. All we can do now is prepare ourselves for the possibility of one day being able to reclaim them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN82.A;We knew the risks and now suffer the consequences…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.T;The Arcadian Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.D;Now that Arcadia is unified, they have sought to expand their borders northwards by demanding that we cede them the southern section of the former Skraelingr lands. It is tempting to refuse the ultimatum on principle, but unfortunately, Arcadia possesses some amount of leverage in this situation due to the complex political history of the Great Lakes region which has entangled both of our nations. While we have managed to negotiate them down from seeking nearly all of our southern frontier, this seems to be the minimum which they are willing to accept. If we refuse, it could mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.A;It is the only way to normalize relations with the Arcadians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN83.B;Come and take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.T;Arcadian Bluster;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.D;Now that Arcadia is unified, they have sought to expand their borders northward by demanding that we cede them the southern section of the former Skraelingr territory. This is, naturally, seen as an outrageous proposition, as Arcadia has no justifications for laying claim to said lands. We may wish to concede the Iroquois and southern Illimark lands to Arcadia anyway to avoid all-out war with the southerners. However, several members of the cabinet, not to mention the populace at large, think that we should take a stand against the southerners, or at least resist their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.A;War would be a catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN84.B;We will not be bullied by a band of southern despots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.T;Vinland Defies Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.D;The foolish Vinlanders have refused to see reason, believing against all evidence that they are under no obligation to relinquish our rightful lands. Given the amount of political capital which we have invested in this endeavor, backing down now would be publicly humiliating for our administration and our nation. However, the only other recourse left to us is war, and if Vinland has formed alliances with foreign powers then igniting a general conflict on the continent could be troublesome indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.A;This is not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN85.B;We will not be pushed around by a bunch of inbred lumberjacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.T;Victory over Arcadia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.D;The eyes of the ravenous southerners proved bigger than their stomachs – the brave forces of Vinland showed them what happens to those who challenge our territorial integrity! Our decisive defeat of the Arcadians has allowed us to demand their complete departure from the Skraelingr lands. Several areas had, it appears, already begun to fall back into the hands of local, indigenous authorities by the time that the Arcadians were beaten. At long last, all of the territories of the Great Lakes are in our rightful hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN86.A;Glory to Vinland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN87.T;The Great Lakes are Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARCGEN87.D;The Vinlanders doubted the power of Arcadia, but we showed them just how wrong they were as we shattered their armies in battle after battle! Now that Erikshavn has capitulated, the time has come to fully secure the lands of the Great Lakes region. These rich territories shall be of great use to our mighty nation, and we shall doubtlessly have no shortage of settlers for them. Vinland has now been shown its proper place, deferential to the rightful hegemon of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

treaty_of_vinland_title;The Treaty of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_vinland_desc;Despite the efforts of our old overlords, the Royal Scandinavian Army and Navy have failed to subjugate us once again. We have endured to the point that many in Scandinavia now believe the war to be hopeless. As expenditures mount and the Scandinavian royal treasury feels the pain of their exertions, let us make a push for peace to force them to the negotiating table. The Venetians, being neutral parties in this war, have offered to host a diplomatic conference in Venezia to establish a final peace agreement. We shall at last secure our liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
end_of_security_committee_title;Dissolve the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
end_of_security_committee_desc;Now that our moment of danger has passed, and the enemies of the revolution defeated, there is a growing sense amongst our people that the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité has served its purpose. The institution’s broad powers were useful during the revolution and in the chaos and violence which followed, but now people are clamoring for true democracy. Most onerous to them is the fact that Sikkerhetskomité members rule by decree and cannot be elected or voted out of office. To avoid a reactionary counter-revolution, we will declare the emergency over and dissolve the Revolusjonær Sikkerhetskomité. Its final act before being dissolved will be to establish a new constitution to guarantee the freedoms of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_exploit_the_jesuits_title;A Jesuit Insurrection in the North?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_exploit_the_jesuits_desc;With the growth and support of the Society of Jesuits within the southern Skraelingr Confederacy, they and their Catholic faithful have reached unprecedented levels of influence. Bellicose members of the cabinet believe that we could force these priests to stir their Indian believers to revolt against the Skraelingr government. While previously this would’ve been suppressed by Scandinavia, Copenhagen has lost control of the Great Lakes and the Indians are likely to be unable to put down the revolt before we can ‘intervene’ to ‘protect’ them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_annex_NUN_title;Annex the Four Fires Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLA_annex_NUN_desc;Now that the Four Fires Council has been liberated from the Skraelingr, we should…bring them more fully under our protection. After all, much of their lands are undeveloped, and it would be irresponsible to let them remain so backward and isolated. Many of them are Catholics as well, and we cannot allow our brothers and sisters in the faith to either be reabsorbed by the Skraelingr or, even worse, fall prey to the Belgians or even the Vinlanders. Therefore, the only responsible thing to do is to bring our enlightened rule to the region and establish the full flower of civilization within it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_title;Assert our Manifest Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_desc;Centuries ago, when the Burgundians first settled this land, charters were handed down which allotted vast swathes of eastern Arcadia to our colonial predecessors. These borders ran all the way to the Great Lakes, but the Scandinavians eventually secured hegemony in the region and Burgundy was forced to halt its expansion at the Allegheny Mountain valleys. The demise of Scandinavian influence within the Skraelingr Confederacy offers us a new opportunity to at last claim the western lands which have always truly been ours. The time has come to bring civilization and enlightenment to this primitive land. Go west, young man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_title;Pass the Indian Removal Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_trail_of_tears_desc;When the Western Territories were acquired by $COUNTRY$, many Belgian politicians wanted to find a way to avoid the violent conflict which was guaranteed to erupt between the natives and the settlers. The proposal which won out was to establish a certain region in which the natives could be concentrated and brought to live with one another, as part of a controlled program rather than driven out by settlers themselves. The intent was to transplant native communities to this new safe zone as quickly and cleanly as possible. In truth, the program was a horrifying disaster. Many indigenous communities were destroyed, thousands died from malnutrition or disease on the journey, and those that did arrive eventually fought amongst one another for the meager slivers of land they were allotted by the government. Nevertheless, at the time the policy was seen as a merciful way to save the Indians from the racial violence which had occurred in states like Flande Superyeure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_title;Finish the Western Drive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NBG_deal_with_SKR_two_desc;The lands which we acquired from the Indians have been a great benefit to our nation, but they are hardly sufficient on their own. Far better would be to secure the rest of the Indian lands, to bring them the fruits of our modern civilization, as well as people enlightened enough to make use of such things. What’s more, we have found older Burgundian documents showing that the furthest western lands of the Indians were accorded to our colonial predecessors by the Burgundian Crown! Clearly, all available evidence points to these lands rightfully belonging to us. We have no reason to tolerate this mistake of Scandinavian foreign policy any longer. All of the Great Lakes shall fly the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VIN_liberal_annexation_SKR_title;Annex the Skraelingr Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VIN_liberal_annexation_SKR_desc;With our political situation now stabilized, the time has come to integrate the Skraelingr lands into our own nation. We cannot allow their autonomous status to be used by the Belgians or the Cadiens to cleave them away from us. While full accord with the natives will have to wait until this is accomplished, at the very least we will be able to make guarantees that their rights and cultures will be respected. By establishing these lands as full components of our nation, we will ease their introduction into our administration. This will also dissuade the natives from attempting to organize resistance against our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VIN_conservative_annexation_SKR_desc;With our political situation now stabilized, the time has come to integrate the Skraelingr lands into our own nation. It will be necessary to place these lands under proper government control until they have been sufficiently developed to be raised up to the standard of the rest of our nation. Still, we shall do our utmost to bring civilization to these backward lands and make them another proud part of Vinland. We have heard rumors of some sort of religious cult organizing anti-Vinlandic movements in the area, but surely those must be overblown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
taking_rialto_title;Launch the Rialto Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
taking_rialto_desc;Ever since the Dual Monarchy and Venice arrived in Arcadia, the border between the Anglois colonies of the north and the Venetian slave trading outpost in the south was poorly defined. The swamp lands in between – not to mention the ferocious natives – made any attempt by either power to push the frontier all but impossible. This remained true even after Plantagenia became independent, with Rialto absorbing many escaped slaves. For decades, Rialto has been claimed by both Plantagenia and Venice on their respective maps yet administered by neither of them. However, recent technological advances in infrastructure and medicine may allow us to finally bring the region under our control. We will deploy a military contingent to clear the way for the first wave of settlers and locate areas favorable to establishing new towns. As soon as the new colonists arrive, our claim to the Rialto region will be transformed into fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Now, that day appears to be in sight. Louisiane is an independent nation, but it is currently unclear whether they will be able to see through the smoke of nationalist fervor to recognize our shared destiny.

While we must not minimize or deny the suffering which they endured, our hope remains that we can overcome the fears and prejudices which divide our nations and peoples from one another. Both of our nations arose because of Plantagenian tyranny – we both sought abolition, sought emancipation, in one way or another. The cause of Arcadian unification behooves us to appeal to those shared values. If Libérie has been overtaken by some sort of domestic despot, however – especially one fomenting ethnic outrage – then we will have to…do some rearranging before they can be integrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This is unfortunate, since our ministers believe that the best way to rally pan-Arcadianism amongst our own people would be to portray Belgium as an unworthy usurper seeking to steal our rightful claim to leadership of the continent. For this reason, subterfuge must be employed. We shall dispatch a few Louisianais men to conduct aggressive patrols near the Belgian border. Given the infamous belligerence of southern Belgians, they will likely be unable to resist the temptation of attacking. At that point we will be able to declare to the rest of the world that Belgium has declared war upon us and forced us to respond to their aggression in kind.

CAL1.T;The Situation of Caladero;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL1.D;The Viceroyalty of Caladero has always existed apart from the rest of the Spanish New World. Seized from Tawantinsuyu ages ago, Spanish colonization has only truly been carried out in the urban areas around the north, near the cities of Quito and Guayaquil. Independence fighters from Caladero, most notably the warlord Martin Ballivián (known to his adversaries as “El Podenco”), participated in a raid on the Inca capital of Cusco, sacking the city. In retaliation Washkar Inca led an army northwards, rampaging all the way to Chan Chan before Dom Henrique Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca y Alfaoes, duke of Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca, rallied a multi-ethnic army of indigenous warriors and Spanish-descended settlers to repel the Inca. The Duke of Tupac was made Viceroy of the colony for his efforts, but the years since then have seen Caladeran politics snarl in unfamiliar directions. Rumors of secret societies run rife around the colony, and figures around the realm may be making plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL1.A;Dreaming of riches, not in a position to make a difference…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.T;The House of Tupac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.D;Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire, had a civil war in the seventeenth century. The Inca claimant with ties to the Chim nobility Paullu Tupac Cuzi controlled Chinchaysuyu (the northwestern half of the empire), but sought an edge over his rival, Sayri Amaru. He thus made the dangerous gamble of asking the Spanish Empire for aid, promising vague concessions if he prevailed. Sensing an opportunity, the Spanish agreed. Some say Paullu simply stalemated Amaru, others that the Spanish sabotaged him, but eventually Spain seized control of Chinchaysuyu. The first Duke of Tupac-Cuzi (often referred to simply as Tupac) was created in 1701 by King Joao III, who awarded the title to the grandson of Paullu Tupac. The Dukes took up residence in Spain and married into European Spanish nobility. The current Duke’s father was the Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia from 1810 to 1820, causing the family to return to the continent. The Duke’s tenure as Viceroy has led to most of his family joining him in their old Chimu estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL35.A;Back to the West Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.T;La Sociedad de Carmelistas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.D;When Spanish King Pedro III crushed Jose II’s liberals with Anglois assistance in 1815, the liberal revolutionaries of the Sociedad de Carmelistas fled abroad. They arrived in Caladero in 1816 but failed to gain traction and dissolved by the 1820s. Now Manuel Sandino, an exile from western Spain, has founded a new Sociedad de Carmelistas. The Carmelistas are a group of Utopian liberals who are committed to many radical causes. They demand the subordination of the military to civilian leadership, wishing to strengthen the armed forces only insofar as they defend democracy. Carmelistas support a strong, centralized, secular, and protectionist government, but one confident enough to be able to devolve power onto local communities in certain cases. Strangest of all is their “Caladeran Dream,” which holds that Caladero represents the synthesis of Andean and European civilization, the only foundation upon which true democracy can be built. While current laws force them to organize in secret they may pose a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL2.A;How bizarre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.T;El Amigo del Pueblo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.D;El Amigo del Pueblo is one of the most prominent newspapers in Caladero, published by radical author Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney. Unlike many other papers, which cater to the conservative aristocracy, El Amigo del Pueblo is a liberal-leaning newspaper with growing popularity among the small but notable Caladeran middle class. While our administration can certainly appreciate a diversity of viewpoints, the newspaper’s recent editorials have brought sharp criticism against the regime. They have criticized the Duke as being a “subservient appendage of Lisbon,” accusing him of courting public support yet remaining loyal to the upper classes and the aristocracy. Many of the articles are skirting Caladeran laws on supporting seditious groups. Quite a few upper class friends of the Duke of Tupac have urged him to shut the paper down, but he demurred, remaining aloof as to how he intended to respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL3.A;Will those liars see the penitentiary, or will they stay free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.T;Rumors About Mururoney;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.D;News of the Carmelista secret society is hard to come by, but we believe they have undergone a change in leadership. The rising fame of El Amigo del Pueblo has brought equal fame to its proprietor, Muyuroney. It seems that the Carmelistas see him as more ambitious, confident, and passionate than Sandino. The latter remains a force within the movement, especially among its more moderate elements, but Muyuroney’s star appears ascendant. If rumors are to be believed, Muyuroney may have assumed leadership of the society itself, or at least eclipsed Sandino as its figurehead. While nothing is certain and both men still cannot be legally proven to be Carmelistas, what Sociedad communications we’ve identified speak of Muyuroney with newfound importance and mention Sandino far less often. This is rather concerning, as whereas Sandino was a more typical liberal ideologue, Muyuroney is a radical firebrand who has been fined for libel multiple times and just barely avoids imprisonment for seditious language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL34.A;Just more gossip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.T;”An Open Letter to the Carmelist Gentlemen”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.D;In response to recent articles in El Amigo del Pueblo criticizing the viceroy, the Duke of Tupac has published a pamphlet countering the charges made against him by the liberals. Defending his record of “acting with fidelity as the obedient servant of all Caladerans,” the Duke has denigrated the Carmelitas as being “overcome by delusions of grandeur,” “ensconced within ivory towers or candlelit basements,” and “utterly out of touch with the actual condition of the people and their needs…in short, mere romantics.” In contrast, the Duke writes, he and his loyalists represent “the only realistic course of the Caladeran government,one which responds to the condition of the nation and its people as they are, rather than as one may imagine them to be.” While the pamphlet has bolstered his support among the less radical elements of the population, it also seems to have backfired. Muyuroney has recently published an article in which the society he allegedly leads was for the first time referred to as the “Romanticos.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL4.A;Well, then, let the Duke’s loyalists be true realists - Las Realistas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.T;The Duke Visits Chan Chan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.D;The Viceroy the Duke of Tupac has visited Chan Chan, the greatest city of the Chimu peoples. The city saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Chan Chan, also known more prosaically as the “Battle of the Army of the Volunteers” owing to the multi-ethnic nature of the ad hoc army which the Duke rallied against Washkar Inca. The Chimu have a bitter history with Tawantinsuyu : they were longtime rivals before being conquered by the legendary Inca emperor Pachacuti. When Spain conquered the northern quadrant of Tawantinsuyu, the Chimu were co-opted to bolster imperial rule. That policy has been continued by Caladero, where the curacas  (former Inca officials), especially those of Chimu background, are a valued part of our army. Some have even converted to Christianity and while we privately doubt the sincerity of their conversions, they have maintained influence within Caladero. The visit was seen as an effort to court the support of local lords against the Romanticos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL5.A;The Duke needs all of the friends that he can find, these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.T;Dom Wilka’s Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.D;Dom Wilka is the local lord of Pachamaq, infamous for his rather liberal views. With the Duke of Tupac now openly courting the support of the Chimu nobility against the Romanticos, Dom Wilka has decided to go public with his support of the Romantico cause.  In defiance of the national ban on the Romanticos’ societies, he has officiated the opening of a society chapter in Pachamaq! Unfortunately, the Dom is a popular man, and we cannot simply imprison him for this act. For now, we must keep an eye out for whoever comes forward to join said society. This is yet another indication of the growing support for the Romanticos within Caladero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL6.A;If he wants to pick a fight with the Viceroy, he should just say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.T;The Plan of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.D;The threat of the Spanish and the Inca has caused the unthinkable : The Duke of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney have formed an alliance! All three have gathered in Quito, in conditions of great secrecy but which was rumored to be anything from a plan to kill the duke to a ploy to arrest the entire Romantico leadership. Instead, a stunning proclamation was issued in which the three political titans explained their intentions to join forces to protect Caladero. Already, the Duke has confirmed the “total extinction” of any remaining ties to the Spanish crown. Several Romantico militias have already emerged from hiding to bolster the ranks of the existing military. While many doubt that this partnership can last any longer than is absolutely necessary, so long as they collaborate it seems like they might be able to unite the nation behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL7.A;¡Por Unidad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.T;Choosing a Generalissimo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.D;If we are to effectively lead an armed revolution then we must decide who shall command our forces. While all three members of the ruling triumvirate are in theory equal, Sandino was only included to keep the Romanticos united and has little military experience. Thus we must choose between the Duke of Tupac and Muyuroney. The Duke of Tupac’s charisma and excellent strategic and tactical mind is unquestioned, but he is still an aristocrat and vesting such power in him could be dangerous for our democracy. Muyuroney is less skilled, though still somewhat adept at offensive operations, and is a committed foe of monarchism, but is also conceited and vain. It is questionable if he could inspire the same confidence and loyalty as a general that he did as an author.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.A;All eyes on Tupac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL8.B;Muyuroney augurs better for our democratic future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.T;The Manner of Promotion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.D;Our revolutionary army is taking shape but we need to establish how its men should be able to rise through the ranks. The Duke of Tupac, yielding to the vast liberal pressure amongst the coalition, has proposed that lower-rank officers be elected by their own soldiers, while higher-rank officers be promoted based upon their performance in the field. Though the Duke sees this as a compromise, it has unnerved the Romanticists, who are cognizant of the many incidents in history when revolutionary generals leveraged their reputations into seizing power. Thus they have proposed that revolutionary committees and their delegates  be the ones to monitor officers’ performance and recommend promotions, for the military high command to be democratically elected, and for civilians to be able to withdraw said commissions by recall vote. This system would be more resistant to tyranny and corruption but it would make Romantico values the army’s standard of conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.A;Fortune favors the bold and so shall we!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL9.B;We cannot risk any Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.T;The Question of the Curacas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.D;The curacas of Chimu and other coastal areas in Caladero were formerly Inca magistrates who ruled ayllus, imperial family units, serving various roles such as tax collectors and priests. When Spain conquered the northern section of the Inca Empire, the curacas were allowed to keep significant privileges in exchange for assisting the administration. Now some have suggested folding the curacas into its command structure, since curacas, like all Inca nobles, were expected to be military leaders and many have served in our army in the past. This would strengthen our influence among native groups and increase our manpower, but to win their loyalty we would likely have to confirm their old privileges. The Romanticos may value Andean culture as part of the Caladeran identity, but they see the curacas as remnants of the old regimes which must be swept away. Therefore they have urged that we instead work to bring the curacas’ subjects into the army without their old lords, cultivating democracy and republicanism amongst the native peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.A;Welcome these honorable men into our ranks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL10.B;Liberty, not aristocracy, must animate the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.T;The Coalition Dissolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.D;The triumvirate of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney has finally fallen apart. Fissions are wracking the military and the civilian administration, and people throughout the nation are now taking sides. While outsiders might see these political issues as merely a binary divide between Realistas and Romanticos, in truth the Romanticos are also divided between Muyuroney’s loyalists and the liberal remnants of Sandino’s supporters. It would be far easier for Muyuroney to take power by making concessions to the less radical Romanticos rather than attempt to rule unopposed. Meanwhile, the Duke of Tupac seeks to put an end to the Romantico threat for good and consolidate power as an unrestricted leader of Caladero. It soon becomes clear that the winner of the struggle is none other than…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.A;The Duke of Tupac and his Realistas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.B;Muyuroney and the liberal Romanticos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL11.C;§RMuyuroney, unbound and unfettered!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.T;The End of the Caladeran Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.D;The Duke wasted no time smashing the Romanticos once he had enough military and civilian personnel loyal to him. Sandino and Muyuroney were both executed for treason, and many of their compatriots are heading into prisons and graves across the nation. Some of these men resisted. Some of these men will never resist again. While the surviving Romanticos have gone back underground, the organization has been dealt a severe blow. Not satisfied with the crushing of his main rivals, the duke decided to put an end to representative democracy entirely. In an announcement before the Cortes Nacionale in Quito, he dissolved the assembly, and postponed elections to compose the new assembly “indefinitely.” Rumor has it that there will not, in fact, be any new elections at all, but that the duke shall select the new legislature personally. For he, with the military and the civil service behind him, is no longer a mere duke, or even a viceroy. He is a president – the undisputed President of Caladero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL12.A;¡Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.T;A Truly Romantic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.D;Muyuroney wasted no time in smashing the Realistas once he had enough military and civilian personnel in his confidence. The Duke of Tupac was ousted by a contingent of soldiers, and met his end in the Quito barracks. Promising to honor the will of his colleagues, Muyuroney has consolidated the stability of the revolution. With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Caladero to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Caladero, true democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. Full democracy and democratic control of the military has been implemented, and our nation shall now be secure both in war and in peace. And now that the revolution has been secured in Caladero…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL13.A;It soon will enlighten the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.T;A Government of Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.D;Muyuroney has brought the old order crashing down through the power of the people! In cities and towns across Caladero, orders have gone out to destroy the enemies of liberty. The Damoclinas are being raised up throughout the nation, where anyone known to have worked for the Duke or the Spanish in general shall meet their fitting end - the Duke was their first victim. As promised, society is being reorganized in accordance with true Romantic Caladeranism, the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European culture. All adult males have been enrolled into the military, as must any man who wishes to obtain Caladeran citizenship from now on. While certain powers shall be vested in local ayllus, the central government will assume the necessary strength to sustain our revolution. Many church properties have been confiscated, taxes imposed on all remaining churches, and all funding to any religious organizations banned. With men of all races now united beneath our banner – and the traitors ground beneath our heels – we shall soon realize the Caladeran Dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL14.A;No mercy for the enemies of liberty! ¡Viva la revolucion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL15.T;A Meeting with the Romanticos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL15.D;The Duke of Tupac is no friend to the Romanticos, but the continued burden of Spanish rule has caused him to agree with them on one point : Caladero cannot remain a mere colony of a faraway European power. Thus, he has reached out to the Romanticos through his own intermediaries to arrange a meeting with them. It took several weeks of touch-and-go exchanges, but Tupac was finally able to secure the audience of some of the highest-ranking Romanticos under conditions of strict secrecy. From the start, the meeting was tense, and it only got worse when the Romanticos laid out a series of demands upon which their assistance would be contingent. Enfranchisement of the natives, nationalization of the largest church estates, and a democratically elected military high command were some of their most notable points. The meeting concluded with…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAL16.D;"Kings, aristocrats, tyrants, whoever they are, are slaves in revolt against the sovereign of the earth, which is the human race, and against the legislator of the universe, which is nature." – Manuel Sandino\n\nWith Cusco in our hands, Muyuroney has determined that the time has come to sever its bonds with Tawantinsuyu and cement its loyalty. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! Our righteous citizen-soldiers are sweeping across the city, hunting down anyone who has oppressed the people. We may be the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European ways, but the cancerous and gangrenous limbs of Andean society must be pruned if we are to prosper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL16.A;And prune we shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL17.T;The Doom that Came to Cusco;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL17.D;"Evil is the disease and violence is the medicine. We must cut at the roots. The people must know their rights and demand them, they must be armed, they must take hold of all the little tyrants of the whole realm. They must overturn the monstrosity of their former oppressive government and erect a new and equal one in its stead. People that believe that the rest of humanity is made to serve at their pleasure will disapprove, but it is not them that we must listen to. It is about avenging the injustice inflicted upon a whole people by its oppressors." -  Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney\n\nWith Cusco in our hands, the time has come to illuminate it with our revolutionary light. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! The Damoclinas are already a common sight on the city streets, as legions of tyrants are brought to justice. Never again will the despotic cruelties of the Inca threaten our righteous citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL17.A;Revolutionary justice is justice perfected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL18.T;La Pragmatiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL18.D;The “Pragmatiana” is a term used by modern historians to describe the period of Caladeran history in which the post-Realistas, most famously the Pragmatistas, came to power. While firmly aligned with the broad Romantic platform, the Pragmatistas emphasized a more reserved approach to government policy, as opposed to the Utopianism of early Romanticos. They are most well-known for advocating “decentralization of both state and citizen,” as described in the Pragmatista party charter of $YEAR$. They condemned the “Caladeran Dream” as “hypocritical, oppressive, and irreconcilably opposed to reality.” Instead, they advocated for a decentralized federation of "nations within a state," defining nations as corporate groups with limited self-organization. Each citizen, they argued, would naturally and willingly align with whichever group best represented them. The Pragmatistas were also pro-immigrant, yet prioritized domestic over foreign policy and have been described (not without controversy) as isolationists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL18.A;The flames of the Revolution are growing colder – thankfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.T;The Land Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.D;For centuries – millenia, even! – the peoples of our land have toiled for the sake of heartless masters who put forth not an ounce of effort to reap their wealth. The infection of serfdom and feudalism ran rife through both the Spanish and the Inca Empires. Generations have lived and died on land which they labored upon, but did not own, and received a pittance for their actions. No more! The new Land Reform Act has leveled the rural playing field. All tenant estates, regardless of the race of the landlord, have been broken up and handed back to their true owners, the people who farm them. As the so-called “nobles” did not deserve this land in the first place, they will not be compensated for it. Instead, we shall aid the peasants in setting up their farms and securing initial credit. The aristocracy is furious, but the people rejoice at their freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL19.A;This land was made for you and me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.T;The Growth of Uraycusta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.D;While our nation has many important ports, none are as fast-growing as Uraycusta. The city is a world-renowned port, serving as a critical juncture for ships travelling between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Wine, fruit, and copper produced across the nation often wind up being exported out of Uraycusta. The city also plays host to several foreign expatriate communities, notably Qingqiuese, Japanese, and Burgundian. Nowhere else in $COUNTRY$ can one so easily find foreign-language newspapers. While reactionaries are unnerved by the growth of the immigrant population in Uraycusta, so far, they do not seem to be moving beyond their neighborhoods within the city. For many they are simply cogs in the great economic machine of Uraycusta, and a welcome sight for the various sailors which regularly visit the port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL20.A;Hail the Jewel of the Pacific!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL21.T;The Caladeran Dollar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL21.D;The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The Inca had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our joining of the Potosi mine with the global market has rapidly turned the Caladeran silver dollar into an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the Caladeran dollar instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAL22.T;The Imperial Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL22.D;“Liwru” is an artificial word – it comes from the Burgundian “Livre” Esterlin, their national currency. It eventually became a synonym of foreign-style metal coinage because of the predominance of Burgundian trade amongst foreign merchants. The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The previous dynasty had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial liwru, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the liwru instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CAL240.D;Founded in $YEAR$, the $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archive Office was principally created to handle the vast among of quipus across the nation and bring them into a more readable format. These lengths of knotted cord have been used for centuries by the people of the Andes to record all sorts of information, from census and tax data to complex histories and religious narratives. Expert quipu weavers could read them blindfolded. Now we have begun converting these documents – for that is what they are – into books and manuscripts, for ease of storage and reference. The work of the NAO will take years, but this undertaking will ensure that we will preserve whatever information is possible to save.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL240.A;We’d best get to work…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.T;The Coronation of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.D;The inauguration of our new Sapa Inca was attended by all the eminent nobles of the realm, as well as foreign observers. As Pachacuti II is a Catholic, certain elements of traditional Inca coronations – such as the ritual sacrifice of animals and idols – were omitted, but the ceremony was still Inca in nature. The participants gathered in the Awkaypata, the central plaza, along with Inca-style statues of certain Catholic saints. Gifts of elegant garments and jewelry were assembled, since this ceremony was also the wedding of Pachacuti II to Anawarki, the sister of the previous Sapa Inca. The Archbishop of Quito led a prayer soliciting God and the intercession of the saints in granting the emperor health and a long life, victory in battle, many children to succeed him, and peace in his time. Once this was done, the Archbishop solemnly crowned Pachacuti II Emperor of the Inca, to the cheering adulation of the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL25.A;And thus dawns the Tupac era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.T;The Birth of Maria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.D;The Emperor’s personal life has grown brighter with the birth of his newest child, a daughter named Maria. His first son was stillborn, while his second took ill and died before his first birthday. He was despairing of being able to have a child, for his marriage to Anawarki was far from being happy – he married her to cement his claim to the throne, not out of any special attraction. But so far Maria seems to be a healthy and cheerful baby. The news has helped to distract from the close role which the emperor is playing in domestic politics, intervening in smaller scale matters one would normally think beneath the head of state. Though some more reactionary ministers murmur that they hope that Pachacuti II and his wife will have a son in the future, for now the realm is simply enjoying the birth of the newest member of the House of Tupac-Cuzi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL26.A;She has his eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.T;Princess Maria Made Heiress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.D;As we have inherited a considerable amount of Spanish law, this includes the quasi-Salic provisions against female rulers. Moreover, Andean traditions abhor the notion of a female sovereign. Thus, the news that the emperor had officially designated Princess Maria as his heiress frustrated reactionaries of both backgrounds. Pachacuti II’s lack of a son made it all but inevitable, but the news has been received badly by traditionalists all the same. In response to the announcement several reactionary newspapers issued editorials strongly questioning Maria’s competence or qualification to rule. The emperor responded by arresting the authors of said articles, and in one case shutting a whole paper down and confiscating its office. His restrictions on freedom of expression come as further pressure is mounting for reforms, calls which the Emperor has so far resisted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL27.A;Why can’t they write about something nice, like how good my daughter is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.T;An Unexpected Retirement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.D;Emperor Pachacuti II had always intended to rule until he was incapable of governing, or until the Heavens took him, whichever came first. Some people, however, were not willing to wait that long for the expansion of democracy. A liberal conspiracy between reformist politicians and sympathetic army officers has rallied to force the emperor to abdicate – and it is led by none other than Crown Princess Maria. The new Empress immediately issued a new royal charter of rights, devolving significant powers onto the national Cortes and expanding the voting franchise. Meanwhile, Pachacuti II has returned to his family’s original Chimu estate. Reactionaries are infuriated at a woman taking the throne, but most of our citizens are simply glad that the era of absolute rule is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL28.A;¡Viva la Emperatriz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.T;Maria Proclaimed Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.D;Last night, Emperor Pachacuti II suffered a severe stroke as he was preparing for bed. While he survived, now he is barely conscious, and not physically capable of ruling the nation. Thus, the Cortes have declared Crown Princess Maria the regent of the Inca Empire. Maria has promised to rule with wisdom and fairness, and to steward and shepherd the nation. Dark rumors are swirling among reactionaries, however, that the emperor did not suffer a stroke at all but was instead poisoned or otherwise incapacitated on Maria’s orders to take power. Maria is known to be far more democratically minded than her father and it had been hoped that her succession would bring reforms. With the Regent in such a precarious position, it seems doubtful that she could afford to radically change Inca society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL29.A;Surely he will recover soon…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.T;Emperor Pachacuti II and his daughter Maria on Friday, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.D;After almost a year of drifting in and out of consciousness, Emperor Pachacuti II finally recovered his full senses a few days ago. While his attendants had intended to break the news of the past few months to him slowly and gradually, the emperor is a cunning man even in his advanced age and ferreted out all the details. He soon confronted Regent Maria, accusing her of attempting to usurp the throne, and intimating that he suspected her of poisoning him (possibly having gleaned such rumors during his investigations). Maria retorted that she was only fulfilling the role that he himself had charged her with, and that she had not done anything rash. The argument devolved into heated shouting, whereupon Pachacuti II seized the halberd-like staff which is the traditional Inca symbol of imperial office and struck Maria. To his horror, she collapsed on the floor. The stress of the situation overwhelmed Pachacuti : as the royal attendants raced into the room, they found him in the throes of a heart attack…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL30.A;¡Dios nos ayuda a todos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.T;False Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.D;Maria’s head wound proved fatal, and Pachacuti II died from a heart attack not long afterward. Palace officials quickly realized that allowing such news to leak out into the public could ignite chaos, inspire various Tupac-Cuzi members to feud for the throne, or even plunge the nation into another civil war like the disastrous struggle of the 17th century. Thus, the imperial clergy, recalling the ancient Inca traditions of venerating departed Sapa Incas, have declared that the emperor has “entered occlusion.” All mention of Maria’s rule as regent is being erased from official records, and a wawqi (detailed golden idol) of the emperor has been placed in the throne room. The empire shall continue to be “ruled” by Pachacuti II, with the Imperial College (a council of Catholic and indigenous pagan priests) led by the Willaq Umu interpreting his will. This new regency has caused widespread agitation in the Empire as Catholics refuse this idolatry and liberals the return of Inca absolutism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL31.A;Long live the Emperor...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.D;The emperor survived his heart attack, but he could not bear to live with himself, knowing what he had done. He went to the palace’s kitchen and locked himself inside, and, after attendants heard a loud thumping sound and forced open the door, was found dead. Perhaps inspired by his own accusations towards his daughter, he chose to poison himself using the Japanese fish which were to feature in tonight’s dinner. Tragically, Maria had not died, but was merely comatose, and awoke an hour after his death. Anguished by the revelation of her father’s suicide, she was inconsolable for days afterward. While all the empire grieves Pachacuti II, the government must continue. She has fulfilled her duty as Crown Princess and has been proclaimed Empress Maria, and her first act as sovereign has been to issue a new royal charter which empowers the Cortes Nacional and expands the voting franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL32.A;In the depths of suffering, the world has the audacity to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.D;While Pachacuti II’s memory never failed him, by 1880 his body was rapidly declining. He lost all vision in his left eye, could not walk without a cane (and gave up trying to use stairs after 1879), and rarely ventured beyond his manor or its immediate grounds. Yet even in this state, he refused to be idle. Shortly after his retirement, he had taken up painting, importing books on the art from Burgundy, Venice, Japan, and Qingqiu. The works that he produced in the final years of his life were described as “a sublime combination of European, Asian, and indigenous styles…though unrefined, possessing a sense of restrained and submerged beauty, of incipient wonder concealed in a manner which only heightens its allure.” It was at his canvas that the emperor was found dead this morning, having moved to the balcony to get a better view of the sunrise. The unfinished work, an impressionist rendering of Cusco as it was in the first Pachacuti’s time, would become a national symbol of a longing for the Inca Empire’s future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL33.A;From the Sun, he descended : to the Sun, he returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Tierra del Fuego;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.D;The southernmost extreme of Ameriga was dubbed “Tierra del Fuego” or “Land of Fire” by Spanish explorers, who saw the bonfires lit by native tribes of the region while sailing past. Though the weather and the seas of this region are infamously dangerous, countless vessels brave it each year to round the continent. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, consolidating our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a far-flung place, and the geographical security which its possession grants our empire, has increased the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL36.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Pampas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.D;The pampas, from the Quechua “plains,” have sustained nomadic peoples like the Het for thousands of years. Some of the best pastoral lands in the world, the pampas are also useful for farming. For many years, European colonizers have warred with the indigenous peoples, be they Beornians or other interlopers. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration of the Pampas. The acquisition of such a fertile place, and the protection from the eastern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL37.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Cartegena de Indias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.D;Many peoples have made their home in the Cartegena region – the Mocana of the Caribs were the most numerous when the Spanish arrived. Their violent subjugation of the region led them to christen it “Cartegena de Indias” after a notable Iberian city. It soon became one of the primary colonial nerve centers, processing vast amounts of trade, and gaining an international reputation as a major Amerigan and Caribbean port. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Cartegena de Indias. The acquisition of such an important and famous place, and the naval power projection which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Liberator of the Andes” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL38.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.D;The mighty Amazon River and its vast basin are home to a fantastic variety of life, plant and animal. The region’s ecological beauty and diversity is overwhelming – and so is its economic potential if the tremendous obstacles of geography could be overcome. Spain made some attempts to settle the northeastern basin, but it was the Dual Monarchy which claimed its coastal edge and thus the interior, a claim inherited by Amazonie. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in the Amazon River basin. The acquisition of such a massive and wondrous place, and the international prestige which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Guardian of the Amazon” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL39.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Ava;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.D;Ava, the land of the Guarani, is a bastion of indigenous culture in the heart of Ameriga. Possessing considerable agricultural wealth, as well as a particularly cohesive native identity (forged in the fires of adversity from Burgundian and later Lotharian colonization), Ava’s economic possibilities have laid untapped for ages. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a unique place, and the strengthened defense against the eastern and southern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Protector of the Guaranis” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL40.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.T;Imperial Majesty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.D;Who can resist Pachacuti II? From the depths of strife, he has raised up the Inca Empire to heights of power and fame never seen! Even the European colonizers have been forced to admit the overwhelming strength of the Inca Empire. Across the globe, our citizens are treated with respect. The word of our merchants is implicitly trusted : the allure of our culture entrances admirers from here to Anvers : and several smaller states have looked to our military while reforming their own forces. We have brought unto Ameriga the light of order, of enlightenment, of civilization, and we have done so without shoving European colonization down the natives’ throats. All of this is thanks to Emperor Pachacuti II! It is his glorious light which the grandeur of our realm magnifies and reflects all around us. The previous dynasty made pretensions of ruling the “known world,” but only we can truly be said to have brought the glory of the Inca across the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL41.A;A radiant sovereign is he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.T;The Pachacuti Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.D;Our influence has permeated the whole Amerigan continent. Now Emperor Pachacuti II has decided to officially announce our role as Ameriga’s shepherd. In a royal proclamation, he outlined what he referred to as our “Continental Obligation as Master of Ameriga” but which foreign observers have dubbed the “Pachacuti Doctrine.” The emperor stated that any incursions by foreign powers upon the Amerigan continent would be taken as a threat to the Inca Empire. The remarks brought forth a chorus of objections from European powers, and it is questionable how many of them will take this proclamation seriously. The true value of it is its expression of our overwhelming influence upon the continent, and the unity of its peoples beneath our imperial banner, directly or otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL42.A;We are the Protector of Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He has now decided to grant a constitution to the Inca Empire which has resulted in several traditional elements of our political system shifting to accommodate new ideas. The Cortes Imperiales has been formed to legislate policy – though with plenty of input from the emperor, of course. A separate judiciary has also been established, though again the imperial court holds significant influence within it. While democracy is slowly being embraced by the people, many aspects of our society remain apart from foreign liberal ideals. Still, the inevitable weakening of royal authority inherent in the expansion of democracy has necessarily reduced the hold the emperor over his country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL43.A;He is still great regardless! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He had decided to grant a royal charter to the Inca Empire but his proposed document was heavily modified at the insistence of many notable politicians. The resulting constitution  of the Inca Empire has created a great transformation of our political system. The Cortes Imperiales acts almost wholly separate from the emperor’s will, while the judiciary stands upon its own footing as well. Democracy and related ideas of popular power have swept across the nation, and much of our society is realigning towards it. This has substantially reduced royal authority and grandeur in a culture where the sovereign has for ages reigned in an absolute manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL44.A;Yet his brilliance still cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.T;The End of the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.D;For roughly four hundred years, the Andes were dominated by the Inca Empire. The region and the polity had for so long cohabited the same space that, in the minds of their subjects, they had become almost synonymous. But, as despot after despot came and went, the free spirit of the people persevered, never losing hope that one day they would be delivered from their servitude. That day has now come! Tupac’s dream of claiming the Inca throne and becoming another link in the chain of tyranny binding the people has been shattered. Rather than his absurd and hypocritical cherry-picking of Hispanic and Andean culture, both wholly self-serving of his imperialist aims, the national culture of $COUNTRY$ is now being realigned. The Romanticos are now hailed as our political ancestors, and their ideas used as the foundation for new political groups and aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL45.A;Freedom delayed and denied no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.T;The Beornian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.D;For too long, we have suffered the abuses of the insolent Beornians. Their raids have terrorized our southern frontier, and they have long sought to conquer vast swaths of said lands. If we are to ever be fully secure as a nation, then we must take severe measures to prevent the Beornians from ever threatening us again. The time has come to extend the hand of our protection over the indigenous peoples of southern Ameriga and drive the Beornians back eastwards. They will be allowed to possess the land necessary to survive, but never again will they raise their hands against our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL46.A;Camelot shall fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.T;The Inkans Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.D;When we heard that the Inkan Empire had been conquered by the heretical Catholic Caladerans, we were all astonished, though it made some amount of sense given the modicum of superiority the Caladerans held over the Inkan savages. What was truly shocking was when the mad ruler of Caladero claimed the Inkan throne for himself and founded a new imperial dynasty! We always knew that Catholics were foul crypto-pagan heretics but few of us ever dreamed that fellow Christians would be capable of such insanity. Now, the northern abomination that is the new Inkan Empire has launched a war of aggression against us! Their treacherous diplomats babble all sorts of justifications for this, but we know that they are simply violent brutes. As our priests marshal the faithful for holy war, the sons of England prepare to crush these monstrous heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL47.A;For king and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.T;The Treaty of Camelot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.D;To the astonishment and horror of all our subjects, the Beornians have bested the imperial armies. A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the emperor was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside. The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to their capital city of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being. Pachacuti II and the whole Inca Empire have been humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL48.A;The Sapa Inca turns to the sky for answers but receives only rain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.T;Colonization of the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.D;The conquest of New Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that their conquest was just because of the Inca aggression. New Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers. However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt. When the Beornians did not act directly, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL49.A;Beornia acted in self-defense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.T;White Peace in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.D;Despite the best efforts of the Inka hordes, our mighty armies cloaked in the grace of God have fended off their assault upon our innocent kingdom. In the resulting peace treaty, the Inkans have been suitably humiliated. They have been forced to recognize our righteous sovereign as the rightful King of Beornia, forsaking their claims to any lands which we currently control. While some had hoped for a more decisive victory, many simply rejoice in the defeat of the heathen foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL50.A;God be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.T;The Year of Shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.D;Not since 1066, on that evil day when the Norman usurpers forced the yoke of slavery upon the Anglo-Saxon neck, have the faithful sons of England known such dark times as this. The savage Inkan despot has driven the whole Beornian Army from the field and arrived under arms at the gates of Camelot. He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept.\n\nThe Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL500.A:My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.T;Beornia Neutered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.D;As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of the Inca Empire to surround the capital of Camelot. Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to our enlightened rule. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their backwards nation and their bizarre Protestant Christian sect, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL51.A;And if they don’t, we have ways of discipling them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.T;Religion in the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.D;When Emperor Pachacuti II established our new imperial dynasty, many of both Catholic and traditional indigenous faiths were concerned about the religious future of our realm. Pachacuti II, however, knew that attempting to either stamp out the existing worship of gods like Inti, or discard the Catholic faith in favor of said gods, would be equally ruinous paths. Yet at the same time the emperor himself is still a Catholic and he does not pretend otherwise. Therefore, he has instituted liberty of personal conscience for religion, but allocating support towards the Catholic Church and depicting Catholic saints in the manner of certain local gods to encourage conversion. While Catholicism is not being imposed there is a general sense amongst our citizens that being a Catholic (or at least acting like one) is the best way to socially advance. Native believers are of course embittered by this but most are focused on preserving traditional ways rather than attempting to destroy the state’s aid of Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL52.A;In the beginning was the Word…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL53.T;The Civil Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL53.D;For ages, the fetters of organized religion have kept our citizens in chains. Both the Catholic Church and the state-managed faith of the natives were used by the elite to bind the people and subordinate their interests. This is no longer the case. We have taken great pains to exclude any mention of any religion from our constitution, and instituted strict, absolute, inviolable separation of church and state. No religious organization will receive so much as a penny of government funds from here on, and all churches must pay taxes. Ceremonies such as marriages, which used to require a priest, can now be accomplished through a simple civil procedure. While traditionalists of all religions are severely displeased by our actions, we are hopeful that future generations shall inherit a nation free of sectarianism or the sinister manipulations of the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CAL53.A;Emancipation of the mind at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
##DECISIONS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

proclaim_the_empire_QUI_desc;The time has come for Caladero to transcend its origins. Starting as a colony imposed upon Chinchaysuyu, neither the old Inca nor the Spanish could have ever imagined that our enlightened Duke of Tupac would create something brilliant here in this oft-forgotten corner of the world. Now, the old Tawantinsuyu has been swept away, but we shall not annihilate it as that madman El Podenco sought to do. Instead, it shall be reborn by our will, reforged in our own image! Caladero shall inherit the Realm of the Four Corners, like Alexander the Great’s Macedon inherited Persia. Of course, an Inca Empire will need a Sapa Inca, and who better than the Duke of Tupac? Due to his lineage, he is, after all, the true heir, the link between the fallen old order and the glorious new one. But, just as Caladero shall be consigned to immortal memory, so shall his old title, ill-befitting his new splendor. Long live Pachacuti II, Liberator of the Andes and Emperor of the Four Corners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Avalonia_INC_desc;Beornia, a state which once held delusions of royal majesty, is now in an even more pitiable state than before. While we have avenged the loyal imperial subjects which they murdered, leaving them alone presents too inviting a target for the Lotharians, who could snap up the region. Worse, we have heard rumors that several Lotharian politicians are scheming to convince the Beornians to join Lotharingia willingly, to lay claim to the entirety of Beornia’s former lands! This cannot be allowed, and therefore we must take action to stabilize the area. The Protectorate of Avalonia will keep the Beornians from growing too insolent by giving them a modicum of autonomy, while also shielding our southern flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

industrialization_chile_QUI_desc;Our geologists and engineers have identified Collasuyu as ideally suited for industrial expansion. It possesses several valuable ores, as well as materials suited for the manufacture of gunpowder. If we were to focus the mitma system on bringing labor to the region, as well as financial assistance for the creation of new towns and the construction of factories, then it should not be difficult to build Collasuyu into a new manufacturing hub of $THISCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Romanticos_dream_title;Realize the Caladeran Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Romanticos_dream_desc;The clouds are lifting! At last, the old systems of division which the Spanish and the Inca cruelly created are within our power to end. Through a multitude of measures, including a standardized national curriculum to establish the Caladeran identity and language, we will liberate our citizens from their fractured status. No longer will separations of geography or language divide us, no longer will we be slaves of the mistakes of our ancestors. Our dream – our destiny to bring true democracy, first amongst our people, and then upon the world – shall now be made manifest! From this day forward, we are all Romanticos, and we are all Caladerans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Araucania_ARE_title;Claim Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Araucania_ARE_desc;We have received word from several explorers that the Araucanian region may hold several deposits of valuable minerals. This news has caused many of our politicians to begin advocating that we reassert the old Inca claim to the region. For centuries, the peoples of Araucania were unruly subjects of the last dynasty, frequently rebelling and waging violent campaigns of resistance. However, with our enlightened rule – and our technological prowess – we should have no trouble avoiding the mistakes of our predecessors and bringing the region under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rebuking_Mercian_claims_title;Refute the Inkan Claims on New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rebuking_Mercian_claims_desc;The Inkan Empire has long laid claim to New Mercia, despite the fact that we have it on good authority that the savage tribes of the region never recognized their overlordship and frequently rebelled against them. In fact, the Inkans have continued to claim the region even after we, by the grace of God, claimed it for our blessed nation! That the savages were overthrown by the heretical Caladerans, who established a new heathen empire in a fit of pure madness, is irrelevant. Now, at last, we have the political clout to proclaim our hegemony in the region and render their ridiculous pretenses null and void. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_Beornia_ARE_title;Claim Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_Beornia_ARE_desc;The very existence of Beornia is a threat to the continued stability and security of our empire. Their frontiersmen have raided the southern edge of the previous dynasty for centuries and we have no reason to believe this will end any time soon. Furthermore, if the Beornians were to ever gain noteworthy strength – or, more likely, be conquered by a more robust state in eastern Ameriga – then the entire southern section of our nation could be imperiled. Therefore it is necessary to strike before our enemies can, and conquer Beornia for our glorious empire! Doing so shall also bring many honorable native peoples into our benevolent embrace, peoples who shall join the ranks of other loyal subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_ARE_title;Establish the Avalonian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Avalonia_ARE_desc;Beornia, a state which once held delusions of royal majesty, is now in an even more pitiable state than before. As it is our imperial mission to bring order to the chaos of the world, we cannot allow them to languish unprotected any longer. Leaving them alone presents too inviting a target for the Lotharians, who could snap up the region. Worse, we have heard rumors that several Lotharian politicians are scheming to convince the Beornians to join Lotharingia willingly, to lay claim to the entirety of Beornia’s former lands! This cannot be allowed, and therefore we must take action to stabilize the area.  Let us…make amends for the actions of our predecessors by officially “protecting” them. The Protectorate of Avalonia will keep the Beornians from growing too insolent by giving them a modicum of autonomy, while also shielding our southern flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_ARE_title;Claim the Amassonan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claiming_the_amazon_ARE_desc;As we consolidate our righteous leadership of the native peoples of Ameriga – under the benevolent protection of the Inca Empire and the rule of its Sapa Inca, of course – we look to the mighty eastern river, the Amassona, and its peoples. It is well known that the eastern Amerigans, especially the Amazoniens and Atlantians, see the peoples of the east as chaff to cast out. We know better! These people, primitive though they may be, possess a nobility all their own. Furthermore, allowing a foreign power to seize these vast lands would bring them to the doorstep of our imperial heartland. Let us bring these rightful subjects of the Sapa Inca into our empire for their own protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_conquest_of_Granada_ARE_title;Claim Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_conquest_of_Granada_ARE_desc; Centuries ago, the Inca Empire extended much further north than it currently does, all the way into the central area of what the Spanish dubbed “New Granada.” These lands were once populated by robust peoples such as the Musica, and though the Spanish may have devoured their nations, their descendants remain in rural communities. Furthermore, many Granadans are themselves descended from these peoples, however much their rulers may pretend otherwise. Our government has thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the liberation of the mestizos of the north is our sacred mission, our destiny! Let us illuminate Granada with our holy light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_het_ARE_title;Integrate the Het;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_het_ARE_desc;The Het peoples of the Pampas formerly inhabited eastern Beornia, but were driven further and further west by generations of settlers. While epidemics have devastated their peoples and many of them have assimilated into neighboring indigenous groups, there remains a distinct Het ethnic and cultural identity. These peoples are experienced at living on the plains in ways which many of our own are not. Furthermore, their historical grievances against the Beornians give them ample reason to side with us against the settlers. By recognizing their cultural institutions and extending them full citizenship, we will consolidate our hold on southern Ameriga and shore up its cultural stability against further Beornian assimilation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_granadans_ARE_title;Integrate the Granadans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
accepting_granadans_ARE_desc;While many of the wealthier and more famous Granadans are fair-skinned, in truth the Granadan population at large is quite mestizo. Their status as an indigenous influenced but thoroughly Hispanophone culture makes them an ideal representation of the type of society which we are seeking to build. If we are ever to maintain our rule in the north, then we must win the loyalty or at least the confidence of the Granadans. By recognizing their cultural institutions and extending them full citizenship, we will consolidate our hold on northern Ameriga and shore up its cultural stability against any resurgence of Granadan nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
occupation_of_araucania_ARE_title;Annex Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
occupation_of_araucania_ARE_desc;We have received word from several explorers that the Araucanian region may hold several deposits of valuable minerals. This news has caused many of our politicians to begin advocating that we reassert the old Inca claim to the region. For centuries, the peoples of Araucania were unruly subjects of the last dynasty, frequently rebelling and waging violent campaigns of resistance. However, with our enlightened rule – and our technological prowess – we should have no trouble avoiding the mistakes of our predecessors and bringing the region under our control. Thankfully no centralized government has yet been established there so we should be able to simply send our forces southward and occupy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
pachamaq_capital_title;Move the Capital to Pachamaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
pachamaq_capital_desc;We have taken control of many former Inca lands, but attempting to rule it all from a capital located so far north as Quito is proving burdensome for our administration. Our planners have identified the community of Pachamaq as the overall best candidate for the new capital city. Unlike somewhere such as Cusco, Pachamaq has far less problematic significance and connections to the Inca Empire. Its current layout is not quite sufficient to replace Quito, but through modernizing its infrastructure and expanding streets and housing, we should be able to enlarge and beautify Pachamaq into a gem opulent enough to rival the great cities of the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

voc_annex_java_desc;The Terres Princières (Princely Lands) were three native states on the island of Java in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indies that were nominally self-governing under the suzerainty of the VOC, two of the major states were the Sultanates of Yogyakarta and Bantam. Their political autonomy was however severely constrained by treaties and settlements. The princely territories were successor states to the Mataram Sultanate and originated in civil wars and wars of succession within the Javanese nobility.\n\nThe Terres Princières have long been under our protection. It would be in our best interests to convince them to come under our direct rule, so we might bring civilization to their people more effectively, and so that we might secure their lands from other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_short_declaration_title;Introduce the Courte Déclaration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration (Courte Déclaration) was short and brief because it contrasted with the "long" contracts that were earlier concluded between the Burgundian Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands.\n\nThe latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Burgundian Indies government were met. The long contracts defined the limits of the competency of both rulers and the Burgundian Indies government.\n\nBy issuing the Short Declaration, we will declare these contracts null and void and we will bring the remaining princes under our direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voc_balance;The Burgundian East India Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voc_balance_desc;The East India Company since it's founding in 1600, eventually came to rule large areas of the East Indies with its own private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions of these areas. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333296.T;The Burgundian East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333296.D;The Vereenigde Burgundische Oost Indsiche Compagnie (VOC) has been described as a cabal of merchants with a state. One of the wealthiest organizations in the world, it has turned its economic might into political and military clout, exerting administrative control and military might throughout the East Indies. While only a small population of Dutch and Burgundian traders form the core population, the obscene wealth of this merchant class allows them to maintain an iron grip on what is essentially a private colony. The VOC is an economic juggernaut, and its merchants hungrily seek any opportunity to further their own fortunes, no matter what it takes. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333296.A;Greed is good. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333270.T;Burgundian Civil War  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333270.D;The ongoing struggle between the Jeanists and Parlimentarians has reached a boiling point, with the two factions reaching a state of open war and throwing Burgundy into chaos. While this poses a threat to the Company's assets in Europe, the collapse of state power provides an unprecedented opportunity to break free of Burgundy and declare political and economic sovereignty. No longer will we have to bow to Anvers - the wealth of East Asia is ours for the taking, and ours alone. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333271.T;Lack of Support for Local Princes ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333271.D;With the outbreak of war in Burgundy, our assets in Europe are compromised, cutting us off from material support and funding. While our wealth is immense, without vital infrastructure and industry we cannot hope to maintain our rule in the Indies for long. Already the local princes we rely on for administration and support are dissenting, with some even speaking of open rebellion. Without aid from Europe, our regime may rapidly collapse.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333272.T;Rebellion against the Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333272.D;With the VOC cut off from European supply, their position is more fragile than ever. Already local soldiers have mutinied, with native troops storming arsenals and seizing arms. This is the time for us to strike back against our would-be masters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333273.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333273.D;With the outbreak of war in Burgundy, the merchant captains of the East Indies Company have decided to make an ambitious move for independence. The colony is in chaos, with the Company leaders struggling to maintain their grip on the Indies.\n\ This presents us with a unique opportunity to gain influence in the region. We can send money and supplies to the native princes, aiding them in their conflict against the company and drawing them further into our influence. This move will certainly prolong the conflict, and further destablize the colony. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333275.T;Liberation of Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333275.D;After a prolonged struggle, we have overthrown the Company and stormed their offices in Batavia. Burgundian garrisons across the archipelago are surrendering or deserting in droves. With the collapse of European rule, the various princes of the region have met in $CAPITAL$, and pledged their support for a united Nusantaran state, with our nation at the forefront. With our forces combined, bolstered by seized Company weapons and funding, we have planted the seeds of a new united and modernized state that the Great Powers of Europe will be forced to reckon with.  ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333275.A;Freedom at last! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.T;Joining Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333276.D;With the Company defeated, a new Nusantaran state has been declared, claiming the entire archipelago. Shall we swear our loyalty to this new native sovereign? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333279.T;Intervention in Nusantara ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333279.D;With our support, the local princes of the East Indies have revolted from the Company and established a new united state claiming the entire region. Thanks to our intervention, the new state has fallen into our influence and is reliant on us for economic support. The imperialists in our government seek to use this opportunity to claim further concessions and directly increase our presence in the region. The fledgeling state is in a weak posistion, and is unlikely to stand up to us. How shall we proceed?   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333279.A;Let them maintain independence, we are satisfied with our new ally. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3332790.D;With our support, the East Indies Company has put down the native revolts and secured its independence from Burgundy. The new state owes its existence to our support, and we have secured generous financial terms and trade deals as a result. The imperialists in our government are not content with this outcome, however, and want to use this opportunity to push for further concessions and direct rule in the Indies. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333282.T;Die Groot VOC;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333282.D;With the rebellion against us crushed, we remain the undisputed hegemony of Indonesia. The local princes have been forced to kneel or been deposed, and the rebellious population has been cowed into submission. Our rule is once again stable, and commerce can resume with unprecedented efficiency. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333282.A;Excellent ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.T;Stabilization of the Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.D;While tensions had risen among the native princes and our situation was chaotic in the months following independence, our vassal rulers have remained begrudgingly loyal, and our rule has stabilized. The status quo has been preserved for the time being. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333283.A;The storm has passed. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.T;Burgundy Demands Submission of Princes ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.D;With the situation in Burgundy stabilizing, our European rulers have decided to take a more direct hand in the affairs of the East Indies, and demanded that the local princes report to them directly rather than through us. We are unable to contest this without provoking escalation, and this serves as a warning that our rule may be under threat from home.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333300.A;Ominous. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.T;The Traitorous Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.D;With the civil war ravaging our nation over, our attention turns to our former crown jewel in the east, which has outrageously used our moment of weakness to play at being kings of their own little fiefdom. These upstart merchants cannot be allowed to break free, and must be reminded that they exist to serve the crown! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333284.A;Demand their immediate submission! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.T;Dealing with the VOC ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.D;With the domestic situation stable, the attention of the crown has turned again to the East Indies Company. While their financial influence and worldwide wealth is unparalleled, corruption permeates every layer of the administration, and commonplace bribery and embezzlement are open secrets. We have let the Company exist on too long a leash for too long, and it is time to reign in these upstart merchants.   ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333298.A;Demand they return to the fold. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.T;The East Indies Nightmare ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.D;Our once prosperous administration in the East Indies has collapsed. A native uprising has spread like wildfire throughout the islands, and the VOC offices in Batavia have been stormed and ransacked. Colonial administrators and merchants have been imprisoned or even lynched for their brutality towards the natives, and the local princes have united under a common banner. While we have little love for the Company as an independent actor, this threat to our interests in the Far East cannot be left unanswered.    ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333299.A;Prepare a punitive expedition. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.D;With Burgundy stabilized, Anvers has decided to reassert its global influence. Citing obviously false examples of rampant corruption at every level of the Company, the Burgundian government has demanded immediate dissolution of our colonial administration, placing our Company lands under direct rule of the crown and relegating us to a purely financial role. Accepting would mean the immediate dissolution of our holdings in the East and reincorporation into the Crown. Refusing would surely mean escalation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.A;We have no choice but to submit. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.B;We will not surrender our wealth and power! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.T;The Company Folds ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.D;In a rare moment of considering the good of the crown above their own profit, the VOC has agreed to our demands to relinquish control of the East Indies. The region will be directly administered as a crown colony, and the majority of company assets have been seized by the state. While the Company remains a powerful financial entity, their status as a semi-independent corporate nation has come to an end. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.A;Let them know their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.T;The East Indies Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but if we do not act it is likely another actor will take advantage of the situation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.A;Declare our support and protection over the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.B;The risks are too dangerous, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333287.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but it presents the opportunity to gain a strong ally in the region and place the Company in our debt. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.A;Declare our support and protection of the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.B;This is too dangerous a move, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.T;New Foreign Sponsor ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.D;Through our diplomatic manoeuvring, we have found a new Great Power to sponsor and protect our fledgeling state. While some of our directors see this as trading Burgundian overlordship for another, this pragmatic move will help us maintain stability while we cement our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.A;The most pragmatic option. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.T;We Stand Alone ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.D;Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find a new European sponsor to protect us. While some scoff at the need for foreign overlords, without support from abroad we are in a tenuous position against Burgundy. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.A;Troublesome... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.D;The treacherous merchants of the East Indies company have managed to coerce another European power to protect them in exchange for influence. Our plans to reconquer them are in jeopardy, as to move now risks sparking a greater European conflict. We may continue to press our demands, but this would easily spiral into a greater war than we are prepared for. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.A;No matter - the Indies will be ours again! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.B;We will bide our time... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.T;Burgundy Withdraws ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.D;Burgundy has renounced its claims over the East Indies and we have forced them to acknowledge the independence of the East Indies Company. No longer bound to Anvers, we have secured our independence and our control of the East Indies! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.A;The spice will flow. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.T;End of the East India Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.D;After a protracted struggle, the East India Company has been forced to submit to us, and relinquish their control over the East Indies. Their colonial administration has been dismantled, and the region will be now ruled directly by the Burgundian government. With their primary colonial holding seized, the VOC's power has been broken, and they will never again challenge our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.A;They have learned their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.T;Future of the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.D;With our independence secured and Burgundy withdrawing from the East Indies, the time has come to consider the future of the region and our administration. One faction of the company believes that in order to survive, the native princes must be invited to form a modern government alongside the Burgundian administration, forming a native republic with a modern European foundation. A more reactionary faction believes that any level of reform is unnecessary, and that the Company can continue to rule as a corporate autocracy, run by and for the merchant class. While the long term stability of this move is questionable, the profit margin is undeniable. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.A;We cannot rule over a disenfranchised population - declare the Republic of Indonesia! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.B;We are free of all oversight - our wealth is all that matters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
