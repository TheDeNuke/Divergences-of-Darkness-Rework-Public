While the uprooting of the party from the state is going to be a smooth process in the face of the current situation, if the party decides to step down, that is, it does also mean that our harsh measures against the citizens will cease in favour of a return to normalcy.

One sizeable portion of the royal court of His Majesty is increasingly growing anxious over these new developments, fearing that they might bring ruin to our nation. Another vocal portion advocates for a continuation of a symbiotic relationship between the fascists and the  $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, to bring back the past glory and stability of our historic past.

DODFFP8.D;With the general turmoil of the recent years subsiding in favor of an uneasy peace and with fall of the old order of things, our young socialist republic has emerged from the ashes after a clique of various left-wing political organization managed to come to an agreement regarding the new administration of our country. While peace in our time seems possible, the facade of the republic is already being questioned by the two wings of the provisional government: a moderate faction wants to return to a more libertarian approach towards the state structure, limiting the reach of the socialist vanguard which ought to be legitimized in regular elections. The Radicals, however, believe that the socialist republic is the wrong measure and are already discrediting it as a bourgeoise deception. The soul of the young people's republic has yet to be determined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

DODFFP9.T;The Vanguard intervenes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP9.D;Parliamentary and presidential elections - one of the first tests for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist republic - were postponed after the results were less than favourable for the ruling socialist conglomerate of wildly different left-wing political organizations. These news gave the incentive for the radical vanguard of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist hardliners to de-legitimize the victories of parties outside the ruling socialist bloc, postponing the elections until the "the socialist republic is secured from within". Whatever the true intentions were, and despite the anger this move has caused in moderate circles, the socialist party has reemerged as victor from the elections, although not in a democratic fashion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

DODFFP10.D;In a rather unsettling turn of events, the ruling bloc of socialist organizations came to the conclusions to not recognize the recent election results after a narrow vote within the bloc to do so in the face of growing popularity of more reactionary organizations in $COUNTRY$. This sparked outrage on virtually every side, as the hardliners condemn the moderates for allowing such an unstable construct to exist in the first place, while more democratic factions denounce the vanguardists for disrespecting the will of the people. The facade of the socialist republic is crumbling, and first reports of political violence in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are coming in.

With the total collapse of the ruling unity party, the streets of $COUNTRY$ are filled with political violence against the perceived injustice from all sides, the young socialist republic seems to meet its end sooner rather than later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

cross_into_burgundy_desc;The Consolidation of the Burgundian Kingdom after the War on the Rhine and the subsequent Treaty of Frankfurt of 1498 meant that the left bank of the Rhine river slipped out of the control of the various local prince-bishoprics and counties for next centuries. Ever since then, this humiliation was attempted to be reversed by the various Jagiellon emperors, and Bohemia would crush the Burgundian army in the Grand Battle of Mainz of 1812 during the Great German War which humiliated Burgundy, granting Bohemia occupation of Alsace and the Confederation of the Rhine. This was reversed in the final Peace of Paris of 1820, however, and Prague has been longing for the Rhineland ever since.

EVTDESC123111;Germany is now fully unified but the problem of Bohemia is still there. Prague sits in the middle of the German lands and the hardcore nationalists call for the same treatment that the German nation received from Prague with the total occupation of the country along with all other known German lands in Europe.

The densely populated and industrialized region has many Germans around Breslau and Lower Silesia, making part of the Greater German Nation. Some also call for the annexation of whole Silesia, but most of the territories in the South are populated by Poles and Czechs.

HRE72.D;With the declaration of a democratic republic, the Holy Roman Empire ceases to exist and rather in its place stands a new German Nation. Bohemia, of course after the previous Bohemian Revolt naturally refuses to remain part of this new federation and has rather gathered around the old Bohemian Monarchy and declared the Kingdom of Bohemia once again. As we must respect the results of the referendum in their territories and as we are a democratic republic; we must let them go. Let the German Eagle rise! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is said that sheer amount of insults thrown by the various northern leaders after this colossal failure of a conference at both the Danubians and the $MONARCHTITLE$ of Bohemia has resulted in various leaders of the south declaring their intention to create a Kingdom of Germany, without Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We must also be concerned at the growing nationalist movements in both Lusitania and Granada are threatening to tear our nation to pieces with the implicit agenda of deciding where our capital shall be located regardless of any potential compromise.

EVTDESC95622;For hundreds of years, the new world was considered a bastion of adventure and freedom from being a citizen of a European nation. However, as immigrants arrive in the new world in the aftermath of the Great German Wars: they find a continent that is perpetually locked in endless wars with either colonial powers or between themselves. This information has been slowly spread around the whole world and it is universally agreed upon that it would better to stay in Europe then run the risk of being trapped in bloody nightmare that is the new world. It would take a period of relative peace to break this reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95623;The Nightmare is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95623;A sense of relative peace has passed over the new world as most major post-colonial conflicts have been resolved in one way or another.

LOT1.T;Federation of Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation declared independence in 1825 among the chaotic events in Europe and Colombia and has maintained relative stability even if there has been friction with Equinoxia and its refusal to compromise with Slave Holders. However, its first action of foreign policy was to seize the region of Atlantia during the Lotharigia Civil War. A action which has not been recognized by anyone in Ameriga and was considered nothing more then a deliberately aggressive act to cement its hold on the continent. If Lotharingia were to stabilize, there may be a final war to decide the fate of Atlantia in the Amazonian Federation and it may be likely that we will fail to keep it. However, if we did win this war then the region would be recognized as our own and Lotharigia will likely be unable to rise against us ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.A;Amazonia Forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.T;Oriental Republic of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beronia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharingian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.A;We will recover Atlantia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.T;The Monarchist Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.D;Lotharingia had devolved into a civil war after the republic failed upon the election of a monarchist to the Presidency. Still, the tensions continue and it is likely that there may be even another revolt if we fail to fix this monarchist issue at some point. So, a compromise must be made with the Monarchists and the current ruling Dictatorship or we may never be able to reconquer the territory of Atlantia. Alternatively we can just ignore the requests of the monarchists and try and reconquer Atlantia without them, but it will likely be extremely difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

In turn, the Congress has voted with a one hundred and ten percent majority to declare war on Amazonia and mobilize all possible citizens. This will be the final chance for Lotharingia to retake what is rightfully theirs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.A;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.T;The Atlantia Counter-Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.D;The region of Atlantia had refused to deal with the monarchists and had declared its independence from Lotharingia before being promptly annexed by Amazonia a decade ago. However, as Lotharingia has become a Constitutional Monarchy with more power to the people rather then the Kings. Many in Atlantia have been questioning why they should stay with a former colony of the Dual-Monarchy that did not even want to declare independence for a extremely extended period of time and rather join with their monarchist, but at least democratic brethren in Lotharingia. This question has come to a head today as Atlantia has now officially declared succession from the federation and has immediately rejoined the Oriental Kingdom of Lotharingia to the utter shock of everyone in $CAPITAL$. We could either act upon this and fight for land that is not even rightfully ours according to the rest of the continent or should we just give up the land and allow Lotharingia to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.A;Send the Ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.B;They can keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.T;Amazonian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.D;The government of the Amazonian Federation has presented a ultimatum regarding the succession of Atlantia from their nation. We must immediately revoke all claims to the territory and not attempt to fight the Amazonian Army when it attempts to occupy the region of Atlantia for the second time or we will be declared war upon and forced to relinquish this territory by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.A;We will not give into their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.B;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.T;The Monarchy Collapses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.D;Whatever prestige the monarchy had after losing this extremely critical war to Amazonia was effectively destroyed today as a rather large amount of citizens barged their way into the Royal Palace and executed the king in his own bedroom before proclaiming a new democratic republic. The military has attempted to restore order by countering these large mobs of citizens with arms fire but the conflict has turned out to be bloody and long as the mobs have broken into the general staff headquarters. If the general staff is destroyed it is unlikely that the military will be able to successfully restore the loyalist government, but there is a equal chance that the mobs will be dispersed before it comes to that. At this point, victory is up in the air for either faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL42.T;A strange letter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL42.D;We have recieved a strange letter from the Duchy of Parma requesting that we appoint a member of the Farnese Dynasty as a General. The individual in question is Antonio Farnese, a abnormally young pick to be a general but it seems that he is nothing less then a absolute genius in every regard. The only reason they sent him to us is because "his ambitions would not be suited to a duchy which is unlikely to survive the next liberal uprising". Your choice, King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL43.D;Antonio Farnese is a heir to the Duchy of Parma. Not a direct heir none-the-less but still one that we can crown as the Duke of Parma and give legitmacy to our ownership of the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL44.T;The Liberal Revolution and Antonio Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL44.D;When the news that Europe had erupted into a liberal revolution, unseen since the infamous German revolutions ultimately arrived at the court of the King of Provence. The General, Antonio Farnese immediately presented a list of demands to the court stating that if they are not heeded, it is likely that this country may find itself annexed by the Dual Monarchy or even worse: made a republic. Universal Voting, A full parliament, rights and liberties to be given to each and every citizen. Insanity, but he is a genius after all. We should consider listening to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.T;The Inevitable Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.D;Antonio Farnese had taken over every single aspect of the Provencal Army inside of a few years after he was granted his title. If the King of Provence would refuse to comply with his orders then he would very quickly take things into his own hands and ensure that there would be a Valois King listening to his demands. The demands that were previously refused have been accepted as the King has been replaced by someone more willing to listen to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.T;Prime Minister Antonio Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.D;The Kingdom of Italy has been created under our rule and yet Antonio Farnese had clearly not had enough power in this new government. He has been appointed as Prime Minister, but at this point we might as well just consider it "Prime Minister for Life" because there is literally no way that anyone could ever hope to compete with his ability to manipulate himself into any position....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL47.T;The Endgame - The Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

GER40.D;He who comes not today, tomorrow surely comes, but slowly doth the oak awaken, and he who goes softly goes well, so runs the German proverb. The German Eagle has seen better days, and it is beyond question that it is the fault of those who held the Rhenish, the Elbians and the Danubians under their yoke. But in recent years, a whisper emerged in the dark alleys of the cities on a Rhine, then mumbling in the factories and stores of Danubia until even the Elbians, who usually submitted to the authority of Prague, joined the emerging chorus: Germany still exists! The dream carried by the descendants of those left behind in the Great German War will never die. The weakness of the Burgundians, Scandinavians and Bohemians is now reinspiring a new national awakening across the former Holy Roman Empire which echoes throughout our controlled territories. Intellectuals are drafting new constitutions, servants of the state are suddenly turning their back to orders given by Anvers, Prague or Kopenhagen and old flags thought lost to the test of time reemerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GER36.T;The Second German Council - Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER36.D;A Second German Council has taken place and has offered a $FROMCOUNTRY$ a crown. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted this crown and has almost overnight created a new "Liberal Kingdom of Germany" which has for all intents and purposes permanently shattered the ability for the Holy Roman Empire to project any power that it once had over Germany. This is a international embarrassment for Bohemia and must not go unpunished. There are currently two plans that have been drafted to prevent this new Danubian Confederation to project any dangerous influence over the rest of Germany- one is a more straightforward approach which involves the immediate invasion and destruction of this abomination along with Burgundy which will happily involve itself in and the other is a far more nuanced approach which involves calling a Third Council and de-constructing Germany into spheres of cultural influence and creating a Rhenish Confederation out of a good portion of their territory which will therefore weaken them substantially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER39.T;Third German Council in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER39.D;Aspirations of German unity have taken a blow today in $COUNTRY$ as the Third German Council in $CAPITAL$ has concluded with nothing more then a long list of concessions that $COUNTRY$ has been ordered to pay for their continued existence as a nation state. These concessions include the immediate succession, or revocation of claims over Slovenia. The succession of all non-Danubian territories and the permission to create a reactionary confederation in the north that both denies us the birthplace of the German Revolution and Hesse. Various politicians in $COUNTRY$ are already calling for the expulsion of Bohemian and Burgundian Diplomats for this travesty of a "council", but others agree with the Great Powers because the alternative is the complete destruction of the Liberal Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE77.T;A Council in Prague?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE77.D;There have been serious unfortunate events in Central Europe that have left many minor German states wondering if their autonomy is still relevant in this modern world. They look to the strongest state in Central Europe as perhaps a unifying force that may allow them to not fall to either republicanism or other forms of extremism. For a short moment in the history of this Empire it may be possible to come to a agreement with the princes and at least partially unify the decaying remains of the Holy Roman Empire if not a full unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE78.T;The Council of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE78.D;The condition of Germany has become intolerable for the King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. After a catastrophe which has resulted in damage to the the legitimacy of this title, it has been made abundantly clear that the old order is breaking down and being rebuilt in the image of various liberal or foreign groups. A council has been called in Prague to attempt to resolve these various issues and conflicts between the various princes and groups of the Holy Roman Empire and perhaps even allow for the centralization of the Holy Roman Empire or a alternative centralized state if that is deemed impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410078.A;This is going to be messy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.T;The Rhine Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.D;Burgundy has reminded us of the treaty that was signed in the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine and that this Council is a violation of that treaty. The Confederation agrees with Burgundy and it is unlikely that they will agree with the unification of the Holy Roman Empire under any circumstances. Even if such a unification is agreed upon by this council, the Rhenish states would prefer to keep their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE80.T;A futile claim?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE80.D;The Holy Roman Empire was a state that was often heavily tied into the legitimacy of its emperor.

410080.A;The Emperor is still the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.T;The Scandinavian Objection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.D;As expected, Scandinavia has presented their opinion that any attempt to centralize either the Holy Roman Empire or any North German State will likely result in an immediate war. As Scandinavia is considered once of the great powers of europe, many council members are wary of the extremely destructive nature of such a potencial war that could occur if the council voted for centralization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE82.T;Transleithania Responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE82.D;The Kingdom of Transleithania has stated that they are the protectors of all South Germans and all other Danubian peoples and that no other state should attempt to claim their lands as belonging to any other empire, regardless if it was the the inheritors of Rome or any form of German Empire. As we have no councillors from Austria at this meeting. It is clear that they have no intent to participate and that somewhat further de-legitimises this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410082.A;That state should not even exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.T;The South is Tamed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.D;The southern princes of Bavaria and Austria are both heavily weakened though turmoil in the region and have countless rivals that consist of practically everyone else in the region. As such we have concluded that it would be extremely easy to persuade the councillors of both Austria and Bavaria to vote for the full centralization of the Holy Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE84.T;Pommerania is Safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE84.D;Scandinavia has failed to penetrate the north in recent years and that has given relative comfort to the various princes in north Germany.

410084.A;Germany shall never be their domain again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.T;The Revolutionary Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.D;The primary cause of this council was that of the extreme threat of the Republican Danubian Federation. Many princes are willing to set aside various differences if only to fight the potential threat that comes from these Republican Revolutionaries! At this point centralization is inevitable unless it is proven that the Bohemian King is utterly incompetent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE86.T;The Scandinavian Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is very little that could prevent complete unification at this point due to the absolute threat that the Scandinavians pose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE87.T;The Council of Prague - Total Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE87.D;The Council of Prague has ended in utter failure. Reports coming out of the council state that it had practically devolved into a barrage of insults thrown at the Bohemian King-Emperor and his utter inability for him and his nation to do anything to protect the empire against outside threats. It is expected that this will only hasten the complete collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and for Bohemia to effectively fade into international irrelevance without drastic action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE88.D;The Council of Prague has ended with a agreement to form an Elbian Confederation between all cooperative North German States and Bohemia.

If we attempt any form of unification or centralization of the Holy Roman Empire then there WILL be war with whatever state results from this council and they will do ANYTHING they can to dissolve that state.

GRE95.D;Greece had waged a war of liberation against Venice and had somehow succeeded in liberating themselves from its control. However, in the process of doing so they had been given a taste of nationalism and have critically damaged our efforts to ever hope to hold this territory in the name of the Turkish people ever again. The fragments of the Greek government have come together to forge a compromise that would allow a Greek nation to exist but for us to still keep political control over it while protecting the Turkish people from harm.

SAFN01.T;The Geuzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN01.D;The various Geuzen republics of the Cape exert their influence over lands traditionally inhabited by Xhosa, Zulu, and Basotho peoples. These rebellious settlers, scattered through the Cape, living in hostile tribal grounds or small communities, descendants of Dutchmen who settled the Cape long ago, have remained nominally independent from the control of the Duke of Africa, a member of the Burgundian Royalty, who maintains a firm grip over the Cape colony. However, they still are under permanent danger, be it from the Burgundians themselves, the various tribes of the Cape, or even the ever ambitious other Geuzen republics. Surely, with their cunning and superior leadership the Geuzen will survive the trials to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN01.A;The Geuzen shall fold to none!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.T;Skirmishes in the south-west!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.D;There have been reports of skirmishes between Leeuwin and Burgundian forces in our south-western border with the Cape Duchy! The region of Mosselbaal, under firm control of the Duke of Africa, is the target of these skirmishes. Obtaining control of this territory will surely be a boon to our nation and a blow to Burgundian hegemony over the southern Cape. However, we don't know how they'll react if we decide to act further upon the skirmishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.A;Send in reinforcements! Mosselbaal will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.B;Signal a retreat, this isn't worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.T;Leeuwin infiltrates Mosselbaal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.D;After light skirmishes were reported all over the eastern border of the Cape Duchy, the Leeuwin forces have practically occupied the contested region of Mosselbaal, for Aloysius, the dictator of Leeuwin and also a member of the royalty, holding this territory means a victory over the Duke of Africa, the rightful lord of the Cape. Surely, such an insult towards his majesty will not go unpunished, lest they become even more emboldened in the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.A;Who cares about the Duchy of the Cape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.B;Aloysius has gone too far. Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.T;Victory in the Mosselbaal War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.D;After the foolish attempt by Aloysius, the rebellious dictator, and his men in the rogue state of Leeuwin to wrest control of our territory via subterfuge and aggresion completely backfired, the Burgundian forces march triumphant over the city Ylnerdam, with the Leeuwin forces broken and their populace defeated, they are left with no option but to accept Burgundian rule. surely nobody will dare challenge the hegemony of the Duke of Africa over the lands of the Cape. Let this conflict be a lesson to anyone who would even dare to encroach upon rightful Burgundian land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.A;The Cape stands tall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.T;Victory in the Mosselbaal War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.D;Our glorious ruler, Aloysius, in his infinite wisdom, has led Leeuwin to victory against the far superior and better-equipped Burgundian forces. The Burgundians, a menace to the independent republics of the Cape, now stand humilliated, with the Duke of Africa completely defeated and forced to retreat from the Cape. While our populace is tired, and our soldiers want to return home, we have completely obtained control of the Burgundian Cape. Now, the Burgundians have no option but to compromise with us and accept that Aloysius is the sole and rightful ruler of the Cape. Surely, the Burgundians will not ever dare to encroach upon Leeuwin ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.A;Leeuwin triumphs, now and forever!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.T;The Military Genius of Aloysius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.D;The Burgundians weren't expecting Aloysius. Not even his own men were expecting him. It all happened in a flash. Aloysius had the burning desire to see the Burgundians out of the Cape, more than ever, and so, he marched with his men against the Burgundian forces in the Cape, completely unprovoked. Nobody knows why he did it, or how he managed to completely destroy Burgundian authority, but he did. Now, the Duchy of the Cape laid in complete control of Leeuwin, and the Duke of Africa was deposed. Surely, Aloysius is one of the greatest military geniuses of our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.A;Aloysius had won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.T;Burgundy signs peace!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.D;With the Mosselbal administration infiltrated, and the territory already nominally incorporated into Leeuwin, Aloysius and his men were prepared to face the soldiers coming in from the Cape. They didn't manage to push the Burgundians beyond Mosselbal, but alas, they didn't get pushed back to Ylnderdam either. After various days and numerous casualties, it seemed like the war was going nowhere. With the war heading towards an obvious stalemate, and Leeuwin still holding onto Mosselbal, Aloysius, in his wisdom, decided to initiate peace talks with the Burgundians. Leeuwin would keep Mosselbal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.A;A victory is still victory, however small.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.T;The Reurveld Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.D;Sitting on the border of the untamed Matabele savannahs, and bordering the republics of Opstalia and New Flanders, Reurveld is a small Geuzen settlement which, like countless other settlements like itself, has maintained de-facto independence. It has obtained widespread fame due to its prosperity, and has drawn the attention of the administrators of $CAPITAL$ , which are now seeking to assert dominance over the region and incorporate them as an integral part of the republic. Should we decide to further press this claim, Reurweld may call New Flanders to intervene, so it might better to tread carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.A;It is time to establish control over the disparate settlements!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.B;Leave Reurveld be, risking a conflict with New Flanders is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.T;Reurveld calls for help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.D;The Reurveld republic, threatened by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ demands of annexation, has decided to turn towards us, pleading for aid against the Opstalian menace. Backing the Reurveld in this struggle, however, could possibly boil over to a major conflict, should negotiations between our nations were to break down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.A;Do we really care about Reurveld?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.B;Proclaim our support for Reurveld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.T;New Flanders backs Reurveld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.D;New Flanders, our neighboring republic, has decided to offer their support to the Reurveld. This is an obvious act of agression against Opstalian interests, and may as well be considered an open declaration of war! This, however, presents the golden opportunity to once and forever end New Flanders, and kill two birds with one stone, by becoming the undisputed ruler of the South African Northlands. In the case that we don't want to risk a conflict with New Flanders, we can always back down from our annexation efforts, but this however will deal a blow to our government's credibility and our people's pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.A;This isn't worth it. We will back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.B;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.T;The Reurveld de-escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.D;Amusingly, feeling threatened by our superior army, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to back down on their demands over the Reurveld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.A;No blood needed to be shed that day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.T;A Stalemate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.D;Following the breakdown of relations between Opstalia and New Flanders, over the Opstalian annexation of the Reurveld, war broke out. However, with none of the sides making any significant advances for days in either front, the war effort had grinded to a halt and both nations no longer had the will to fight each other anymore. With soldiers tired, hungry, and angry over the conduct of their governments, a treaty of peace was signed between New Flanders and Opstalia, nothing had changed, and blood had been spilled for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.A;All of this, for Reurveld? Seriously?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.T;The New Northern Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.D;Following our astounding victory in the Reurveld conflict, we are in complete control of the Northern republics. The Northlanders (distinguished from the Cape Geus) have long been separated between the republics of Opstalia and New Flanders, but this was in the past. We can now become something greater, a union of Northlanders, to ensure the security and stability of the northern Geuzen! This, of course, will not go unnoticed in the south, where both Leeuwin and the Cape Duchy look threaten our way of life. The North will not fall!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.A;Glory to the Northlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN14.T;The Xhosa Conquest of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN14.D;To the Southeast of Leeuwin lie the Xhosa lands. The Xhosa, an ethnic group indigenous to the Eastern Cape, have inhabited these lands for hundreds of years. It is our utmost priority to expand into these lands, before the Burgundians or the Northlanders decide to intrude first! Therefore, our brilliant military strategists, under the wise supervision of Aloysius, have devised a plan to completely dominate the Eastern Cape and establish control of the region. This would open up later opportunities of expansion, as well as giving us a direct border to the dangerous and fierce Zulu lands! We should not underestimate the Xhosa, but were we to achieve victory, the Eastern Cape would become an integral part of our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.A;The Eastern Cape will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15;T;Zulu Conquest of Basotholand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15.D;Every day, the European settlers take more and more land around us. Fearing our eventual downfall, our great and wise Inkosi, has decided that an expansion of the realm is necessary if we are to prevail against the European invaders. Therefore, our eyes look westwards, towards Basotholand, we rally the Impis, and the drums of war resonate through the land once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15.A;Usuthu! Usuthu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.T;Expansion towards Basotholand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.D;The Basotho people, an ethnic group indigenous to the region we call Vrystaat, live in highly decentralized communities scattered called Kraals through the flat grasslands of the Vrystaat, where they have practiced agriculture and herded cattle for centuries. However, given the sparse population of their realm, they should be a target ripe for conquest. Of course, obtaining this region before our rivals will surely be a great boon for our nation, and we would be one step closer to completely dominating the Cape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.A;March towards the Vrystaat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.T;Containing the Zulus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.D;The Zulus, the most warlike and aggressive of the scattered tribes of the Cape, are a present danger to Geuzen settlements all over the Cape. Their men fight with unbridled force and zeal, and they will surely prove to be a challenge, were we to invade their lands and pacify them once and for all. However, obtaining control over their realm, shall lead us to a strong regional position, and the natives would be under our control once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.A;Strike down the Zulus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.T;The Retreat of the Natives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.D;The Zulu and Basotho, the most prevalent indigenous tribes of the Cape, and prime targets of our expansion, have fled to the Highlands, where they hope to be free from our grasp. Given our position right now, we are in no place to go after them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.A;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.T;Regarding the Geuzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.D;King Jean, sole and rightful ruler of the Burgundian Realm, had known that the Geuzen settlers presented a threat to the survival of the Duchy of Africa, Aloysius, the rogue dictator of Leeuwin has been challenging the Duke of Africa's legitimacy, with the Leeuwin growing ever stronger and expanding by the day, What would King Jean decide to do regarding the Geuzen menace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.A;King Jean orders the duke to strike down Aloysius! Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.B;King Jean orders the duke not to attack Aloysius! It's not worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.D;The preparations were set. King Jean, as was expected, had granted authority to the Duke of Africa to finally strike down the Leeuwin menace! The Duke, having been expecting this exact moment for years, readied his men and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnderdam would fall, and the traitor Aloysius would finally submit to the Duke of Africa, rightful ruler of the Duchy of the Cape! Of course, the path ahead would not be easy, as the Leeuwin had also been preparing. But with the support of the illustruous King Jean, the duchy would never fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.A;The First Geuzen War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.D;King Jean, that blasted traitor, has told the Duke of Africa not to invade Aloysius' realm. What did Jean expect? That the rightful ruler of the Cape would simply stand idly and let Aloysius completely take over the Cape, while he sat there and watched it all burn? The Duke had been waiting for this moment, and it would not be cast down by the designs of a petty King in Anvers! The Cape was the rightful realm of the Duke, after all. So then, the Duke readied his troops, and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnerdam would fall, and Aloysius would be finally struck down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.A;The First Geuzen War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN22.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN22.D;The matters of the Duchy of Africa were far beyond the watchful eye of the $MONARCHTITLE$, the Duke already knew this. After all, the Duke's forces had already managed to pre-emptively strike and prematurely ended the Leewuin menace. Burgundian approval would not be needed for the Duke to act! It was time to strike the remaining Northlanders, the Cape was destined to be unified under the thumb of the Duke of Africa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN24.T;News from the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN24.D;The Duke of Africa, a member of Burgundian Royalty and the current ruler of the Duchy of the Cape, has sent a warning to King Jean about the inevitability of a widespread conflict breaking out between the Duchy and the Geuzen States. The Duke, emboldened, has assured King Jean that he has the situation under control, and were he to attack the Geuzen, victory would be swift and bloodless. What the King needs now, is to bend the Parliament to his will, so that if a war was needed, the Duke would have all the support needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN24.A;War on the horizon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.T;A plea to the Geuzen States?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.D;With the Geuzen War raging on, it is clear that Aloysius' men can't handle the entire might of the Duchy of the Cape. $COUNTRY$ stands at a crossroads, the leadership could either swallow its pride and request assistance from the Geuzen States to the North. Were they to join us, the Burgundians would stand no chance against the might of the united Geuzen! Of course, Aloysius could always refuse to request their assistance, but what would become of Leeuwin in that case?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.A;Call upon the Geuzen States!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN26.T;The Call of Leeuwin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, finding itself in a bloody clash against the Duke of Africa, in a surprising move, has called upon us, to assist them against the Duchy of the Cape!

SAFN26.A;Of course, we will aid Aloysius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.B;Surely, they jest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN27.A;Call upon them! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.T;A plea to the Northlander Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.D;With the Geuzen War raging on, it is clear that Aloysius' men can't handle the entire might of the Duchy of the Cape. Leeuwin stands at a crossroads, the leadership could either swallow its pride and request assistance from the Northlander Union, the Geuzen state to the north, and a rival to our hegemony. Were they to join us, the Burgundians would stand no chance against the might of the two Geuzen powers! Of course, Aloysius could always refuse to plea for aid, but what would become of Leeuwin in that case?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN31.T;A state of total war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN31.D;To our complete and utter dismay, those blasted Northlanders have completely betrayed the Geuzen cause and declared upon us, taking advantage of our current situation.

SAFN32.T;A surprising turn of events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN32.D;With the war going in favor of the Duke of Africa's forces, the Leeuwin leadership saw no option but to ask their Geuzen brethren for help. To their dismay, and our bemusement, they have completely backstabbed them, and now Aloysius is facing a two-front war. Of course, the Northlanders must think that they are clever, but we are one step ahead. It is time to end the Geuzen menace completely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN33.D;With Aloysius out of the picture, after our majestic victory against the rogue Geuzen state of Leeuwin, all that remains between us and complete control of the Cape, are the separated Northlander republics, New Flanders and Opstalia. These two republics, constantly locked in petty conflict, will be target of a swift campaign, which will surely be nothing for the Duke of Africa, who has led the Cape to victory time and time again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN33.A;The Cape will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.T;Strike the Northlander Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.D;With Aloysius out of the picture, after our majestic victory against the rogue Geuzen state of Leeuwin, all that remains between us and complete control of the Cape, is the Northlander Union. Having been constantly locked in petty conflict, the Northlander republics have become one, and have consolidated the northern Cape. The Cape will be united under the Duke, to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.A;The Duke will lead us to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.T;Conflict in the Mainland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.D;With the situation in the Burgundian heartland quickly descending into pure chaos, and the Parliamentary faction waging all out war against the loyalist forces of King Jean. The question of the Geuzen War hangs from a thread. What are we to do regarding the Duke of Africa's conflict against the Geuzen states? We could pull out from the conflict, which would essentially mean returning to the status quo, or continue with the war! This, however, with the situation in Burgundy growing more dire by the day, wouldn't be the wisest of decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.A;Order the Duke to pull out from the Geuzen States!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.B;Nonsense! We didn't invade the Geuzen for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN36.T;Peace with the Duchy of the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN36.D;With the Burgundians pulling out of war against us, We no longer find ourselves in a state of conflict against the Burgundians. The Northlander Union has prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN36.A;A return to peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN37.T;Peace with the Duchy of the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN37.D;With the Burgundians pulling out of war against us, we no longer find ourselves in a state of conflict against the Burgundians. Our Republic has prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN37.A;A return to peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.T;Victory in the Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.D;Even with conflict consuming the mainland, The Duke of Africa, managed to prevail over his enemies. The forces loyal to the Duke now stood victorious over the rogue Geuzen states of the Cape, and the undisputed reign of the Duke of Africa stood unchallenged. With the Geuzen broken, and the Cape under the guiding hand of the Duke of Africa, the Geuzen War had ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.A;The Duke stands victorious, onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN39.T;The Nieje Hoop Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN39.D;With the First Geuzen War over, the Geuzen states find themselves at a crossroads, many think that with the era of Burgundian aggression over, it is finally time to seek the unification of the disparate Geuzen States. However, with the conflictive ideas of the different states, such a call to union can easily fail and break down. The Geuzen will have to put aside their differences, or face war once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAFN39.A;Call for Geuzen Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.T;Call to unification!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, after the conflict with the Burgundians ended, has ambitions of unifying the Geuzen states, into one single entity! Of course, for this to go through, all of the Geuzen States need to accept, which, given the rebellious nature of our peoples, is unlikely. How will we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.A;The Geuzen will be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.B;Of course not! And give up our independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.C;Approve their decision! Move North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.T;Geuzen Winds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.D;With the Geuzen States setting their differences aside and agreeing to unification, all that remains is formally signing and formally merging the governments of the Republic. This signals a new era for the Geuzen, now united, nobody shall stand against them! Burgundy will tremble, and Batavia will never stand divided again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.A;For Batavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.T;The Neije Hoop War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.D;As some expected, negotiations between the Geuzen States, which were in the middle of talks regarding Geuzen unification into a single political entity, have broken down. Now, in a total state of war, the Geuzen states find themselves in a final conflict. Whoever stands victorious by the end, would claim the mantle of the sole Geuzen State, and unify them once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.A;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN43.T;The Dust Settles...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN43.D;With the end of the Neije Hoop War, $COUNTRY$ stands triumphant, after completely crushing the treacherous rebel Geuzen States!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN43.A;For Batavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN44.T;Diamonds found in Rijsseenfoort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN44.D;In $YEAR$, Diamonds were found in Rijsseenfoort, nearing the Geuzen border with the Duchy of the Cape. Worry has sprung up, given the proximity of Rijsseenfoort to the Geuzen States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN44.A;Surely, nothing bad will come of this finding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN45.T;Regarding Rijsseenfoort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN45.D;Today, one of the many settlers of Rijsseenfoort appealed to the Parliament and pleaded to get support so he could start a prospecting and mining operation in Rijsseenfoort. This was inevitable as after the news of diamonds being found, there are countless proposals made everyday to the parliament about opening up exploitation of this newfound resource.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN45.A;All we have to do is say yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.T;Prospectors to Rijsseenfoort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.D;A team of prospectors and miners from near and far, as was promised to the Duke, have been assembled and are ready to head towards to the riverbanks of Rijsseenfoort, sluices and dregs in hand, to reap the pure wealth from the riverbanks!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.A;Good luck, prospectors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.T;Prospectors attacked in Rijsseenfoort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.D;Following the news of diamonds being found in Rijsseenfoort, our $MONARCHTITLE$ had become aware that the Burgundians had started operations and were trying to fully extract the precious metals. However, nothing could be done about it, as it was Ducal territory, and we sat in an uneasy peace with them. We had nothing to worry about, until news reached our $MONARCHTITLE$ that a group of rebellious Geus settlers near the border with Rijsseenfoort crossed over and completely slaughtered the prospectors, as they were "encroaching upon their rightful land". This will not end well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.A;Conflict is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.D;Those blasted Geuzen had done it again. When news reached the Cape, the duke was overtaken by a primal sense of fury and righteousness. The riverbanks had been painted with blood, as the innocent prospectors and miners laid massacred on the shores. The Geuzen, unprovoked, had intruded upon his sovereign lands and brutally attacked the prospectors leaving no survivors of the bloodshed that ensued. There was nothing left to be said, all that remained was to act. Ready the men, the mad dogs will be put down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.A;Thus it begins!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.T;Victory in the Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.D;Following the disastrous happenings in the Rijsseenfoort riverbanks, the forces loyal to the Duke of the Cape and Burgundy swiftly descended upon the Geuzen, with a fury never before seen. They wanted revenge for the senseless killings against innocents commited by the Geuzen, who had invaded the frontier and committed a bloodbath. Intended or not, the Geuzen weren't going to get away with their actions one more time. And they didn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.A;The dogs have been put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN50.T;Future of Batavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN50.D;Leuwin under the rule of the Governor-Militant Aloysuis van Afrika and his successors have united the three old Geus Republics in one state that controls nearly all of South Africa. Many wonder what the "van Afrika" will do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333250.A;Crown Aloysuis king of the United Geus !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333250.B;The fight for freedom must continue !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN51.T;The trekkers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN51.D;Following the Burgundian conquest of Kaapstat some Geus instead of fleeing to Leuuwin or staying under Burgundian domination decided to create their own communities in the North. They have agreed to integrate our growing state now that Burgundy is no longer under direct control of the Geus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333251.A;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN52.T;The future of South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN52.D;With South Africa finally in a state of seemingly permanent peace. It is now attracting colonists from Europe after promises of empty land and guaranteed peace have been heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333252.A;May it last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.T;The Inevitable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.D;Having already kicked out the sneering Burgundian imperialist from our lands, who would dare exploit rightful Geuzen resources, the Geuzen states remained in a state of uneasy peace. It was obvious that this status quo was not going to last long, given the conflictive nature of the Geus Republics. All that was left was to prepare, and to stand ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.A;The Cape will be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.T;The Geuzen Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.D;The conflict had kicked off. All of the Geuzen States found themselves in a state of total war against each other. Only one of us shall stand victorious in the end, and surely it will be $COUNTRY$! Our $MONARCHTITLE$ will lead the country to total victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.A;The final showdown is at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.T;The Geus, United at last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.D;Following a glorious victory in the Geuzen Civil War, and due to the military genius and enlightened guidance of our $MONARCHTITLE$ during these trying times, $COUNTRY$ stands as the sole Geuzen State in the Cape. We are now in a position of power, and as the sole undisputed power of the Cape, greatness beckons! Long live Batavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.A;Batavia Breathes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.T;Our Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.D;Vryland, having maintained its independence due to sheer luck at this point, found itself the target of Burgundian ambitions. With the Geuzen out of the way, very little stood between them and absolute domination over the Cape. Opposing Burgundian rule would be practically a death sentence, since we stand in no position to possibly defeat them in an armed conflict...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.A;Bend to the Burgundians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56:B;We shall defend our lands, even if it means certain death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.T;The Autonomous Duchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.D;The Duchy of the Cape has asked to be governed as an autonomous dominion within the empire. Given the conflictive nature of the region, we have various ways on how to proceed about doing this. We could follow through with the petition and set up an autonomous dominion operating out of the Cape, and including our Geuzen holdings in the region, or instead, should we find that the region isn't worth of being autonomous, we can always maintain direct control. However, this surely wouldn't be a popular decision within the populace of the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.A;Set up a dominion with the Geuzen territories included.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.B;Maintain direct control over the Cape, they aren't worthy of self-governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.C;Set up a dominion with the Geuzen territories included. For the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.T;The end of Vryland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.D;After being reduced to a mere vassal of the Burgundians, we have received news that they the removal of our autonomy is imminent. We would come to form an integral part of the new Duchy of South Africa, under strict Burgundian supervision. We can't do anything about this. This is the end of the Bastaards's freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.A;Vryland lies dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.B;For the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.T;The Great Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.D;The Baastard, disregarding the disagreements and setting aside their differences with the Geuzen settlers, had decided that they had enough of unending Burgundian oppression, sacking, and imperialism. The Cape had to be free of Burgundian claws, even if it means the complete destruction of the Geuzen States! Facing defeat after defeat, and humiliation after humiliation, the Geus are filled with a zeal and fury never before seen. They would fight to the last man, in one last ditch effort to purge the vile Burgundian plague from the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.A;One last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.T;Whispers of Discontent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.D;The South African Duchy thought that finding itself free from Burgundian control would be perfect. But they wouldn't be right. Lacking Burgundian peacemaking and funding, every day more regions of the Duchy fall to the Geuzen and Vrylanders, who are the biggest dissenting group in the duchy. It would seem that secession is inevitable, and so is war. Perhaps this could've been averted if the Duke was wiser with his decisions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.A;What will become of us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.T;The Great Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.D;Following large-scale rebellions and demonstrations all across the Duchy of South Africa, the Duke knew that he had his days counted. Alas, he really was expecting the Vrylanders and Geuzen to rebel once again. Without foreign support, and without any real power of his own, what is he to do? Everything points to the end of the Burgundians in the Cape, with Geuzen and Vrylander numbers overwhelming. What will become of the Duke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.A;Is this the end of the Burgundian Cape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.T;Regarding South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.D;After the removal of the Monarchy from our realm, there are loose ends that need to be dealt with. One of such loose ends, is the Duke of Africa, who rules over his petty fiefdom in South Africa. The Duke has multiple times expressed his desire to wipe the Geuzen from the face of South Africa, citing Geuzen aggression, and other much more personal matters with Aloysius, the current (or former) dictator of Leeuwin and claimant to the Duchy of Africa. We can choose between tolerating the Duke, or compromise with the Geuzen by granting them control over our least vital holdings in South Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.A;Tolerate the Duke, let him do as he pleases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.B;Offer land concessions to the Geus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.T;An offer from the Burgundians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.D;After the fall of King Jean and the Burgundian monarchy as a whole, the Duke of Africa's grasp over the duchy is tenuous at best, with no support from the new Burgundian order, and Burgundy's desire to pacify and quench the Duke's ambition, we have been sent a proposal to compromise with the Burgundians, this would mean the removal of the Duke of Africa from the Duchy, and we would also obtain control of everything but Ville du Cap proper. While we could always compromise with the Burgundians, which would be best for the stability of the region, is the new regime any different from the one before? They're still Burgundians, after all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.A;Accept their offer, we are in no position to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.B;Accept an offer from the Burgundians? Outrageous. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.T;Refusal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.D;As some circles within our government expected, the Geus haven't gotten past their pride and have rejected our generous offer, which was meant to maintain peace in the region and remove any traces of the perfidious Duke of Africa, a blasted remnant of the old monarchy. It seems that we are in no position but to assist the Duke in his efforts, since the Geus' pride and short-sightedness have played against them once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.A;Is this war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN65.T;The First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN65.D;After the downfall of the monarchy, the Duke of Africa was hanging from a tightrope, fearing a lack of support from the new regime, however, after a surprising turn of events, fate played in his favor and he had the support of the Burgundian heartland. So then, the Duke, emboldened by the newfound approval and assistance of the new regime, readied his troops, and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnerdam would fall, and Aloysius would be finally struck down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN65.A;The Cape Burns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN66.T;The Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN66.D;Generals have been gathered in $CAPITAL$ for an important and secret meeting. Over the table has been drawn a map of South Africa, divided between our state and the Burgundian colony. On it, our secret services have indicated the cities and villages most likely to help us in the liberation, and the weak points of the Burgundian forces on the border. Everything seems to be ready, and the chief of staff point out that there could be no better moment for this plan to work. Now the decision rests in the leader of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While many of the papers related to the day-to-day affairs have been lost, the most important damage concerns the secret archives of the Ministry, who have but a few been lost to the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN68.T;A report from the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN68.D;We have several agents in the Northlander Republic, and one arrived yesterday to the Cape with documents of great importance according to his report. Paul Kruger as he is called, was a clerksman working at the ministry of war of the Republic, and he had heard about a great plan of a surprise attack against our colony. Securing the document, he laid fire to the building to avoid being caught and ended up in the Cape after a few days of travel. These plans show the audacity of the Northlanders, and the news has already stirred the jingoists at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN68.A;Thank you mister Kruger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN69.T;Plan Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN69.D;Our plan has been put in action, with the Geus populations of the Cape colony having risen up against their oppressors. Let every man from our Republic chase the Burgundians from our shores!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN70.T;Treachery from Kruger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN70.D;The burning of the ministry of war was no accident ! A spy from Burgundy, Paul Kruger, who had obtained a post at the ministry uncovered the plan for the insurrection and war that our leader decided to not put into action a few months ago. He stole the plan and set fire to the building to avoid being caught. Thanks to his treachery, the Burgundian high-command has prepared countermeasures to our operations and also has planned to attack us in retaliation. We must mobilize every man in the Republic to fight for our independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN70.A;We should have attacked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN71.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN71.D;Today the troops of the Northlander Union crossed the border with the Burgundian colony of the Cape, triggering the second Geuzen War with Burgundy. For weeks tensions had risen in the Geus communities of the Eastern Cape, and the Northern Geus were able to secure several critical provinces in the former Leeuwin before the invasion thanks to various networks of informants and rebels. Now their troops walk toward the Cape, and this war will decide the fate of the whole South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN71.A;What does the future entail ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN72.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN72.D;Burgundian troops have again crossed into Geus lands, this time for the last time according to Burgundian statements. Following the discovery of a plan of a sneak attack on their colony, officials in Anvers decided to end the independence of the Northlander Geus. This war will decide the fate of the Burgundian colony and the whole Geus people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They understand that we have limited claims over the region, but at the same time expresses the fact very clear that the region is absolutely dominated by Burgundians whom can never be directly integrated into our Empire (at least legally). Therefore, they are willing to trade away the region of Romandy as a personal union underneath the Dual Monarchy so long as we promise "eternal autonomy" for the inhabitants of Bourgogne. This treaty is only a net positive for us- so long as we maintain the provisions of the treaty and do not at any point change the status of the Bourgogne region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;

BRG01.T;The Kingdom of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG01.D;"A kingdom without reason, without culture, without purpose" - Louis XII, King of the Dual Monarchy. The Kingdom of Burgundy was created with the reorganization of the possessions of the Duke of Burgundy in the Congress of Arras. There, the Duke swore fealty to the French Crown, but the annexation of the latter by the English resulted in complete independence for the new-born Kingdom. Centuries would pass and Burgundy grew in strength and power as both the Holy Roman Empire and Dual Monarchy were unable to interrupt its rise in any reasonable way. The most recent event was that of the German Revolution (followed by the Great German War) in which liberal forces attempted to create a independent united Republic of Germany. The fury of these revolutionaries would shake the status quo in Burgundy and cause the creation of an autonomous "Duchy of the Rhine", little more than a puppet state. As Burgundy is no longer bound to the treaty that created this entity, it annexation seems imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DIE1.T;The Dietsland Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIE1.D;With the independence of the Netherlands- our so called "High Dutch" speaking population have been quite curious to why the ruling class of their nation almost entirely consists of Brabantians. The Brabantians are very closely aligned with the French-speaking Burgundians and after hundreds of years of cultural integration they are barely Dutch at all! Why should the lands of the Dutch be ruled by the Brabantians? Was the very point of the creation of a independent Netherlands to be ruled by the Dutch and not the Brabantians? These questions and so many more have ultimately resulted in the concept of Dietsland or a so-called "Dutch nation state" being passed around in our educational and scholarly institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG4.T;The 20th year of mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG4.D;This year marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Jean-Maximilien de Julich, husband of Queen Anne. Betrothed early to ensure the close links of the principality of Jülich inside the Burgundian kingdom, their couple was a happy one (a rare occurrence in royal families). 4 sons were born of their union between 1810 and 1817 : Jean de Brabant, Charles-Joseph de Frise, Maximilien de Nevers et Philippe de Flandre. Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus III of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role, already reduced, has plummeted with most of the Royal powers taken by Parliament in her absence. While her father Joseph II still chose his own government, Anne prefers to pray and live a reclusive life, giving more and more powers to her heir Jean who is all but a Regent, in name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG5.T;Election of the Archbishop of Cologne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG5.D;The tacit accord between the Papacy and Anvers has been for decades that the Burgundians would not intervene in the elections of the archbishoprics in exchange for rewarding loyal and quiet clergymen instead of politicians in Cologne and Mayence. The election of the latest Primate of Germany had seen for example Karl von Wittelsbach-Zweibrücken elected, a conservative nobleman who pose no threat to Burgundian rule. But in Cologne, the Pope has recognized the election of Josephus von Elnere as archbishop. A popular figure in the Rhineland, he had taken part in his youth in the Frankfurt assembly before leaving it when they infringed on the rights of the Church. Escaping to the Rhineland, he has formed countless charities while preserving some of the spirit of the German revolution, notably in his sermon of accession in which he has praised the Constitution of the Duchy of the Rhine and Liberal ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653005.A;We will watch him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG6.T;Religious awakening in the Rhineland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG6.D;Rhineland has always been a catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. When Philippe I of Burgundy broke with Rome in 1530, the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine, members of the Burgundian circle, and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the Rhine. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside, reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour, and in the most devout circles, criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653006.A;Would the Rhenish stop already ??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG7.T;The 1000th anniversary of the Treaties of Verdun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG7.D;The Crown Prince Jean has made a remarkable visit to Verdun at the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the treaty that saw the Carolingian empire split between the 3 sons of Louis the Pious. Jean, a conservative and jingoist character has cultivated for years a 'link' to Lothar, the kings of Burgundy seeing themselves as his heirs since the inception of the Kingdom. Among the various platitudes and strange comparisons that his speech included, one has caught the ears of Rhenish journalists : 'like in the days of Lothar, we now see men of the Church conspire to break down the state. As Hincmar advised Charles the Bald, we now see traitorous talks in the Catholic clergy, hoping to separate the lands of the Rhine from their rightful sovereign. Burgundy will not suffer the fate of the kingdom of Lothar, and this beautiful and mighty country shall stand once again united and strong'. These words caused an uproar in the Duchy of the Rhine but the Prince refused to renege on his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653007.A;Who cares what the Rhenish papists think ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG8.T;The Union Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG8.D;The personal union of the Duchy of the Rhine has caused problems for years. Many Dutch capitalists fear to invest in this industrial land because of the fact that the local government could change legislation or raise new taxes, a right they were granted with the formation of the Duchy. Furthermore, conservative circles fear that agitators are given too much freedom there and the military wants to have direct control over the Rhine fortifications, the first line of defence of the Kingdom being shared with Rhenish troops that are widely distrusted by the General staff. There is thus a general will to act on the matter with a draft of a Union Act that would see the Rhenish people given the same rights as the rest of the people of the Kingdom with special articles protecting the Catholic faith while also ending the temporal powers of the high clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653008.A;One kingdom on the Left Bank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG9.T;Failure of the Act of Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG9.D;As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has vetoed the proposition, while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life. The Anvers Parliament could have forced the Bill, but they would have needed the assent of the sovereign for this. Anne then refused to intervene, fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom and reassured the Rhenish, angering many Parliamentarians and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653009.A;Best to not upset the course of things ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG10.T;The meeting of Cologne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG10.D;Rumors have come from Cologne that Von Elnere would have met with the Revolutionary leader Hanno Tauber. Heir of the German revolutionaries, the Burgundian state has suspected him of animating various conspiracies and liberal associations throughout the Rhineland but so far nothing conclusive has ever been uncovered. If this meeting has happened, this could mean a lot for the political situation in the Duchy, as both the Archbishops and Tauber could mobilize revolutionaries to free the Rhineland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653010.A;We must watch the Rhineland even closer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG11.T;The Rhineland Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG11.D;The worst fears of the Burgundian government have come true : the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen, in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state. The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them, only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside, to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists, all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of Burgundian imperialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653011.A;Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG12.T;Burgundians are coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG12.D;We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy! Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653012.A;Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG13.T;The Rhineland Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG13.D;The government of the Duchy of the Rhine has broken the Personal Union with the Burgundian kingdom, and the Archbishop of Cologne has taken advantage of this to rally the Rhenish people under his rule, granting a liberal constitution and encouraging revolutions in Germany. This has prompted the Burgundians to mobilize their men to retake what they consider their rightful lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653013.A;The Left Bank is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG14.T;Act of Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG14.D;The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union in $YEAR$. The various privileges, especially the ones related to the two archbishoprics were removed and the Burgundian police confiscated weapons all across the reoccupied lands. However the act also granted equal representation and voting rights to the people of Rhénanie along with a general amnesty for the revolutionaries that had taken arms, at the exception of the archbishop von Elnere who died in exile several years later. The act also saw the reaffirmation of the anti-slavery stance of the Burgundian kingdom and many Liberals saw it as the proof of the transition to a truly Liberal and Constitutional Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653014.A;One kingdom, one law!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
BRG15.T;The end of the Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG15.D;The war against Jean united Republicans and Liberal Monarchists for a time but everyone knew that the issue of the form of the state would have to be resolved. Charles-Joseph de Frise, second son of Marie, is in Finland and has renegated his claims to the Burgundian throne which is a sad affair, as he would have been an excellent choice for all but the hardcore Republicans. Now Burgundy must choose between the continuation of the Monarchy with Maximilien de Nevers, third son of Marie, as a King devoid of power or declare the Republic. The Republicans are fiercely opposed by the nationalists who see them as Dutch and Jewish elements wanting to weaken Burgundy, and these groups would be ready to use force to crush the radicals. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653064.A;All hail our new monarch Maximilien II!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653064.B;Burgundy shall be a Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG16.T;The end of the Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG16.D;The war against Jean united Republicans and Liberal Monarchists for a time but everyone knew that the issue of the form of the state would have to be resolved. Charles-Joseph de Frise, second son of Marie, was the first choice of the Parliamentarians but he has been missing for years. Rumours say that he is retired in the Finnish wilderness, that he has been searching for the El Dorado in Amazonie or that he joined a Buddhist monastery in the Far East. With no proof of him still alive, the Regency has declared him officially dead and now Burgundy must choose between the continuation of the Monarchy with Maximilien de Nevers, third son of Marie, as a King devoid of power or declare the Republic. The Republicans are fiercely opposed by the nationalists who see them as Dutch and Jewish elements wanting to weaken Burgundy, and these groups would be ready to use force to crush the radicals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG17.T;The Burgundian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG17.D;Burgundy has suffered too much in the past years. Everyone thought that the Regency would have ended the period of unrest the country suffered but it only ended with more instability and bloodshed as nationalists and Republicans fought over the future of the country. The military had to step in and so they did : veterans from the Civil War took control of the capital and the major cities, ending the previous government. The coup was swift and well organised, with the General Schnaebelé proclaimed Protector of the Burgundian State. No more will Burgundians will fight one another because of politics: all will answer to the will of the Protector who will restore order and stability and glory to Burgundy and all its inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653066.A;Dire situations require harsh solutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG18.T;Rumours in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG18.D;Burgundian nationalism has become a driving force of politics since the Civil War with a series of non-official but also official statements targeting the Dutch people. Often seen as the model minority compared to their Rhenish cousins, the Dutch were always accepted and in turn contributed greatly to the Burgundian state which protected their trade and allowed them to develop their lands and trade. Facing increasing distrust from the Burgundians, Dutch have begun to adhere en masse to Nationalist organisations that want to end Dutch subservience to the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653067.A;We must watch them carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG19.T;Dutch protests;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG19.D;Finding mutual ground with the trade unionists, the Dutch nationalists have begun a series of protest following the latest government law targeting the use of Dutch in administration. While these protests are quite minor they have even reached the capital and Brabant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653068.A;Dutch are Burgundians and will behave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG20.T;The Dutch affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG20.D;Protests are not allowed in our state and the Dutch knew it. Despite the orders of their rulers they decided to demonstrate again. The Burgundian answer was swift, with soldiers firing into the crowds to end these seditious gatherings. But in doing so this has been the point of no return for the Dutch and Frisians who are now in majority against $COUNTRY$. The other so-called 'Great Powers' also look to the situation with interest, jealous of the glorious path we have followed these last years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653069.A;If I had known that the Netherlands were a powderkeg about to explode...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG21.T;The Dutch Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG21.D;Burgundy has acted for years as a rogue state in Europe, expanding its borders without any interest in preserving peace or balance among the powers. But now they face serious unrest at home in the Netherlands, and it seems it may be the greatest opportunity for the various powers of Europe to stop Burgundian imperialism by calling an international conference to settle the Dutch affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653070.A;We will host the conference !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653070.B;We must not anger Anvers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG221.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG221.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to interfere in our domestic affairs by organizing a conference to solve the problem posed by the Netherlands. It would be a disgrace to bow to international demands, but at the same time we may stall time in this conference to better act against the insurgents in the North...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653071.A;Burgundian affairs are solved by $THIS$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653071.B;We accept to attend -but we will not bow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG22.T;The Dutch Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG22.D;Because of unrest in the Netherlands Burgundy has been forced to accept an international conference to mediate the Dutch problem. Three solutions have emerged from the various diplomats present : Burgundy and her allies propose to keep the status quo. Their main argument is that allowing other powers to dictate the politics of a Great Power sets a precedent that could be used against every country. On the other hand friends of the Dutch push for an independent Netherlands that would severely weaken Burgundy. Otherwise we could try a fragile compromise by establishing an independent Grand-Duchy of Holland that would concentrate most of the Dutch provinces but not threatening Burgundian integrity as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG23.T;$CAPITAL$ Conference: Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG23.D;Burgundians rejoice as the Great Powers of Europe have accepted to maintain the status quo in the Netherlands. Dutch revolters have been left on their own against the Burgundian state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG24.T;$CAPITAL$ Conference: Netherlands Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG24.D;The Dutch delegation rejoice as the final protocol of the conference of $CAPITAL$ has declared that Burgundy shall give independence to the Netherlands, citing the right of the Dutch to govern themselves democratically rather than live under the dominance of the Burgundian state. Now all powers are waiting for the response of Burgundy, whose ambassadors are in great discussion with the highest level of governements to decide what path they shall take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG25.T;$CAPITAL$ Conference: The Dutch Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG25.D;Neither the Burgundian nor the Dutch propositions gathered enough traction in the diplomatic circles of Europe. The conference having grown to a stalemate, a third option was established as a compromise : Holland will be created as a Grand-Duchy encompassing most of the Dutch lands while still leaving Burgundy mostly intact. Furthermore this state would enforce a strong neutrality and cause no threat to the Burgundian capital of Anvers. This proposition does not satisfy neither the Dutch nor Burgundians but maybe this will be enough to maintain peace in Europe ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG26.T;International support for the Dutch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG26.D;Our enemies gathered in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have declared in majority for the Dutch, and ready to enforce their protocol on us. According to the international conference, we would have to cede all the Netherlands that would become an independent state or be ready to defend our rights with our military might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG27.T;International support for Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG27.D;Our diplomats were not convincing enough in the international conference for our proposal of non-interference to be followed by the majority but at least the independent Netherlands solution was also refused. Instead, the protocol of the conference wants to establish a neutral Grand-Duchy of Holland that would encompass the heartlands of the Dutch people while still leaving us with Brabant and Frisia. It would be a blow to our prestige but should we risk further support for the Dutch insurgents ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG28.T;Burgundy weakened;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG28.D;Burgundy has accepted the protocol of $CAPITAL$ and the Dutch independence was proclaimed in Amsterdam and the Hague mere minutes after the signature of the treaty. The treaty is widely denounced in Burgundy, especially in the military which could definitely lead to another war to reassert their claims in the near future. But for now, the days of Burgundy as the prime power of Western Europe are over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG29.T;Independence of Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG29.D;After long days of waiting the Burgundian goverment has accepted the protocol leading to the establishment of the Grand-Duchy of Holland. This arrangement satisfies neither the Dutch nor the Burgundians. Furthermore their enemies are also upset, feeling that the terms do not weaken enough Burgundy. But at least peace is guaranteed in Western Europe for now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG30.T;Burgundy defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG30.D;The protocol of the conference was refused by Burgundy that has claimed that no foreign powers shall violate her sovereignty. This has only emboldened the Dutch nationalists who have given recognition and financial support by the various powers of the conference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG31.T;Burgundy defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG31.D;The protocol of the conference was refused by Burgundy that has claimed that no foreign powers shall violate her sovereignty, despite the international community only asking for the independence of Holland.

BRG32.T;Rebellion in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG32.D;Despite the International community refusing to help them, it seems that the Dutch radicals will never accept our rule. Military reports show that arms are being smuggled all over the North and policemen have been forced to barricade in several towns as arsonists and rebels defy our authority. A full scale rebellion seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653082.A;Let them rise, only to be crushed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG33.T;The Dutch Madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG33.D;The Dutch people stand alone against the Burgundian might. 'Democracy will be conquered by our bayonets and we will not stop until the Staatsvlag stands above Antwerp!' has been the message transmitted by a coalition of Nationalists and Socialists gathered in the Hague following their declaration of independence. Now is the moment that will define the fate of the North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653083.A;They seem doomed to fail...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG34.T;Growing insecurity in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG34.D;With the International community supporting them, it the Dutch radicals have been emboldened and swear they will never accept our rule. Military reports show that arms are being smuggled all over the North and policemen have been forced to barricade in several towns as arsonists and rebels defy our authority. A full scale rebellion seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653084.A;We are ready for what comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG35.T;The fate of Champagne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG35.D;We possess claims to Champagne which we had lost in the prior Anglois-Burgundian War, but with their situation complicated in the Netherlands we could make a secret arrangement with their government in which they would give Champagne to us and revoke their claims to ensure our neutrality in the coming war. Otherwise we will take it by force (and help the Dutch of course)!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG36.D;We have received a proposal from $FROMCOUNTRY$ asking us to cede Champagne to us or risk that they intervene in the coming war against the Dutch. If we cede the territory we will be safe from their intervention but it is still a rightful conquest of the Anglois-Burgundian War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653086.A;Champagne is a small price to pay for the rest of our state...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

'Democracy will be conquered by our bayonets and we will not stop until the Staatsvlag stands above Antwerp!' has been the message transmitted by a coalition of Nationalists and Socialists gathered in the Hague following their declaration of independence. Now is the moment that will define the fate of the North and also Burgundy as a whole, as many foreign powers try to break Burgundy once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG39.T;Pacification of the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG39.D;The war is over and the pathetic Dutch state has been pacified by our armies. With most nationalists captured or in exile the Dutch movement has lost traction amongst the general population. A general amnesty has been granted to the Dutch population and it seems the old relationship between Burgundy and its Northern inhabitants has been renewed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653089.A;We forgive them for their errors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG40.T;Loss of the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG40.D;The Dutch Republic has won its independence and Burgundy has been forced to let go its Northern territories. This is a terrible blow for Burgundy but at least it's the only important territory that Burgundy lost during the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653090.A;How could it end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG41.T;Burgundy dismantled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG41.D;Vultures have descended upon Burgundy which has been disarmed and dismantled by its enemies. The Dutch have their independence and the various powers that Burgundy took lands from now hail back their flags in their territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653091.A;A terrible blow for Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG42.T;Success of the Lotharingian League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG42.D;The defeat of King Jean did not mean the end of his ideals. Aristocrats, countrymen and soldiers who were drawn to his conservatism and jingoism still maintained several Jeanist organisations in Burgundy over the years although they never posed a great threat to the regime. However it has changed in the past few years : Nicolas Léon, a disgruntled officer has created the 'Ligue Lotharingienne', a nationalist organisation hostile to Parliamentarism, pacifism and Socialism. A renowned orator, he has attracted Burgundian crowds and calling the Civil War the biggest mistake in the history of the country. A supporter of the Jeanist pretender in exile, although with his own outlook on how the country should be run, many reactionaries and also members of the armies have joined his party that will surely become a force to be reckoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG42.A;What is this new ideology ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG43.T;The Restoration coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG43.D;Burgundy lost its power over the years and the latest defeat was only the nail in the coffin. Seeing the opportunity, several high members of the general staff with links to the Ligue Lotharingienne have gathered in $CAPITAL$ and demanded power be handed to them. The leader of the Ligueurs was then invited to form a government with a policy program in 5 points : the restoration of the rightful King, the end of Parliamentary politics with a mandatory enlistment in the party-state, nationalisation of the 'traitor industries', refusal of the demilitarisation and a strong Burgundian state to lead its people to glory. Jean VIII was swiftly crowned although he held no true power like his grandfather had entertained some decades ago and acted as a puppet of the Ligue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Duchatelet renovations were continued despite the political instability as the Baron always took the side of whoever held the capital and included the demolition of crowded and unhealthy medieval neighbourhoods, the building of wide avenues, parks and squares, the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Anvers, and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

BRG2.D;Burgundy has been rendered landlocked by the independence of the Netherlands and the conquest of all remaining European ports under their control.

JEAN1000.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1000.D;The tensions have grown too important in the previous years leading to a popular revolution in Anvers and the Royal Family of Burgundy has been forced to flee abroad. The various contradictions of the old system have been swept away and it seems that Burgundy is now entering a new era of stability. Old feuds between the North and the South of the former kingdom seem to have been set aside to reach out their hands to guide the Burgundian Republic to its destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653095.A;Past the horizon shines a new light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1001.T;King Jean flees to Ameriga;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1001.D;The former King of Burgundy has fled to Ameriga! After a civil conflict in the until-recently unstable nation, the King's forces have been decisively defeated. There are, of course still many who believe in his vision for Burgundy, although for them his escape is a blow to their legitimacy. Although the future looks peaceful for Burgundy, the king himself has said that he is not yet done with politics, and shall look to any opportunity to reclaim his throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

JEAN1002.A;He is gone, for now ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1.T;The death of Queen Anne;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1.D;The queen of Burgundy, Anne II of Cleves-Valois-Bourgogne has died yesterday in her country mansion in Eupen. A devout and retired monarch, she was seen as a figure of unity by the population although not many truly loved her. As the funerary convoy passed through the cities of Central Burgundy to be buried in Anvers with her late husband many noticed that it was her last son, Philippe of Flanders that led the procession rather than her heir Jean. It was no secret that tensions and divisions marked the royal family, as the Queen resented the affirmed and oppposite personnalities of both the Reactionary heir and her Liberal second son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653020.A;At least she joins her beloved in their mausoleum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN2.T;The coronation of Jean VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN2.D;A few days after the official funeral of the late Queen, Anvers was preparing for the new coronation of the King. As the ritual dictates, the King enters Saint Michael's Abbey where the Archbishop of Anvers demands him an oath to protect the Realm, the Faith and cause Justice for his subjects. Following this, the King is annointed like the Kings of Israël. From this coronation emerged Jean VI of Burgundy, acclaimed by the crowds of Anvers. Foreign journalists witnessed some opposition to this joyous occasion, notably from Liberal students that were however soon disposed by the police before being able to disturb the procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653021.A;Dei Gratia Rex!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN3.T;The Adress to Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN3.D;The Sovereign of Burgundy opens and closes Parliament, and even the late Queen Anne did her duty although always following the advice of her Prime Minister. Jean VI however had a different mind on the royal function. As the members of the two Houses gathered to hear his speech, he proclaimed that he had sworn to protect the people of Burgundy and that he would take a more important role in politics compared to his mother. His will was not to infringe on the rights bestowed to his subjects by his predecessors but only to exert his rights and duties as King of Burgundy. While the members of Parliament applauded the speech as the custom dictated, the malaise felt by many was apparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653022.A;What does it mean for Burgundy ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN4.T;The Pinto affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN4.D;François de Pinto was a member of the East Indies Company who was in charge of lobbying members of Parliament in favor of the company. In $YEAR$ he became the centre of a mediatic affair as corruption of members of Parliament was revealed by the Conservative newspaper 'Le Temps'. This was a blow to the Liberals since most of the members that had received bribes through da Pinto were of their faction, and the number of laws protecting the interests of the Duch-based company provoked popular discontent throughout the Southern lands of Burgundy. As the son of a converted Jew, Da Pinto was a perfect target for the newspaper, and was soon forced to flee Burgundy because of the many threats he received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653023.A;The V.O.C must be reigned in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN5.T;The Anti-Corruption bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN5.D;Following the Pinto affair, Conservative members of the Upper House proposed a bill that aimed to reduce the lobbying towards members of Parliament. This move was not a disinterested one : the Upper House was filled with nobles who had ties to the industries and foreign trade but never were lobbied like the Member of the Lower House. It was soon clear to many that the law while proposed by the Upper House had been drafted by the King who intented to play a role in politics. Even though the popular opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill, the Lower house rejected it, declaring that current laws were sufficient to prevent another Pinto affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653024.A;What is this masquerade ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN6.T;The King's Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN6.D;After the failure of the anti-corruption bill, the King proposed a new bill on the subject. Despite concessions from his side, it was clear it would lose the vote. When the speaker called for the house to vote, hard knocking was heard on the door of the chamber, and when it opened, it was none other than the King himself, dressed in full regalia who entered the chamber. He demanded the speakers chair, from where he held the subsequent speech :;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653025.A;I can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN7.T;The King's Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN7.D;'It has become clear over the past couple of months that nobody in this entire institute that claims to represent the Burgundian people actually represents them. This Chamber houses nothing but the representatives of the interests of industrialists, merchants, of money and the destructive forces of modernism. If no single man here is willing to defend the common people of this kingdom from these interests, as you were willing to show again with the vote of this afternoon, duty falls upon the oldest institute of our kingdom to do what this chamber has failed to do. Is it not the institute of king that, bound by blood and rooted in our soil, represents our nation's past as her tradition, our nation's present as her voice and our nation's future as her hope ? It is because of this weight on my shoulders that I have decided to, in my due right as king, to dissolve the current session of Parliament until new elections have been called and a new parliament can take place in this chamber. Gentlemen, you're free to go home.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653026.A;What just happened ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN8.T;Beginning of the Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN8.D;Liberal members of Parliament were always critical of the erratic ways of the King but tolerated him for the sake of order and continuity. But with the intervention of Jean in the Parliamentary process and his wish to exert his royal powers he has become a threat to many in Burgundy. This feeling is not restricted to the men connected with the V.O.C but also true Liberals who openly question the legitimacy of a King who does not abide by the informal laws edicted by his predecessors. It seems that the growing divide between Jeannists and Parliamentarians only grows every day and could severely result in problems for Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653027.A;A new era of Burgundian politics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN80.T;Jeanist Coup in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN80.D;After a few street battles, Jeanists have won the power struggle in burgundy. The nation of Burgundy is, however, not politically united. Despite the Reiksflagge fluttering triumphantly over the nation, parlimentalists and liberals still sit, waiting for their chance to once again turn the fate of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6530270.A;At least it wasn't that bloody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN9.T;The State Language Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN9.D;Burgundy has been a pluricultural state for centuries with Dutch and German accepted in their territories while the Burgundian language, this hybrid Oil language, codified by the Royal Academy from Bourguignon, Wallon, Lorrain and countless Dutch and Flemish influences was always the primary language of the state. Now in these times of uncertainties, Germanophobia is again a powerful force in politics and a group of moderates (deputies who are not in the Royal or Parliamentarian faction) have pushed for a unified language act that would abolish the teaching and the use of German, Dutch and Frisian in Burgundian public institutions. While it has the support of the majority of the House whose members speak the purest Burgundian form of Anvers it could rekindle the fires of revolt in Rhineland. A radical faction has even proposed not to repel this act and maintain the status quo but to use this law to grant more language autonomy to the Germanic regions, as to ensure their loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.A;'Un Royaume, une langue';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.B;We do not need to change anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.C;Using their language won't change much, grant them autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN10.T;The trial of Johan von Bosse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN10.D;In the Pinto affair one deputy was largely attacked, the self-proclaimed Republican Johan van Bosse. A controversial figure in Burgundy throughout the years, he only avoided conviction by royal authorities because of his elections to the Chamber and the large popular support he enjoys in Bruges. But the various bribes he took from the V.O.C has eroded his position and he lost his seat in the latest election. Now he faces a trial that is very much piloted by the Monarchy as the judge is a renowned Jeannist partisan. What will happen to the Republican of Bruges ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653029.A;Van Bosse is convicted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653029.B;Van Bosse is freed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN11.T;The death of Philippe Rickwaert;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN11.D;For months, the duke of Ligny Saint-Pol, a close friend from King Jean had threatened journalists from the radical newspaper 'Le libre Luxembourgeois' to stop attacking the king. A prominent nobleman in Luxembourg and a vocal critic of the Burgundian Parliament, he soon became the new focus of Philippe Rickwaert, the owner of the paper who revealed the various affairs the duke entertained with women of little virtue throughout his various estates and properties. The duke challenged him to a duel, that Rickwaert refused, and then descended to Luxembourg where he shot the journalist to the death. This affair has rallied the radicals who have gathered in thousands for the burial of Rickwaert but the King can hardly let one of his supporters go in these times of need. The court packed with Parliamentarians (if one believes the Jeannist newspapers) has declared the duke guilty, but the King can still pardon him ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653030.A;The king will pardon his friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653030.B;The affair is too delicate, leave the judgement as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN12.T;The Walloon Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN12.D;In an interesting turn of events, a relatively minor law in the Burgundian Estates Generale, the law itself concering minor matters of Administration in Wallonian, has snowballed into a major crisis point for the Political system of our nation. What was once unthinkable has happened: the Estates Generale has stood against our King, demanding major concessions in the Wallonian region. Allowing the Estates to get away with this could soothe tensions in the nation, albeit giving administrative concessions in wallonia to the Parlimentarists, which could undermine our authority in the eyes of the people. If the King forced the Parliment to accept his demands, it could anger the people but give more political power to the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653031.A;The King allows the Estates Generale to have the concessions ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653031.B;The King forces the Estates Gernerale to accept his will ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN13.T;The Arsenal of the Burgundian Navy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN13.D;The port of Anvers is the main port of the Kingdom, and one of the biggest and more active in the world. The development of the capital has increased the problem of silting and many fear that the works needed to maintain the military port and prevent problems in the Escaut would be too much to pay. Rotterdam on the other hand poses no such problem, and is directly linked to the Rhine, the main artery of commerce of Burgundy. Thus the Parliament has envisioned to transfer much of the military facilities away from Anvers to Rotterdam, causing uproar in the capital as the arsenal is one of the biggest employers of the city. The King profited from this to take the defence of the capital, and this subject has become another divide between the Royals and the Parliamentarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653032.A;Rotterdam is best for the long term interests of Burgundy, do not listen to the rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653032.B;The King vetoes the law : the Navy stays in Anvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN14.T;De Broglie;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN14.D;Lately, the removed-cousin of the King, Antoine de Broglie has gotten the ear of the King. A ranked general in the Army, he also is seen as a capable administrator leading the Parti Royaliste in the Upper House. Since the times of Joseph II (1790-1817), the Prime Minister has always come from the winner party in elections but nothing legally forces the King to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653033.A;De Broglie will form a government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653033.B;We must not upset the unwritten laws of the Kingdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN15.T;The Abdication Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN15.D;The conflict between Jean and the Parliament has reached its breaking point. After years of divide between the Monarchy and the deputies, the Lower House has expelled the Royalists from the Chamber and declared the Crown vacant. Following this seditious act, the King mobilized the Army to disperse and arrest its leaders. Now the whole city-and the world wait for what happens next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653034.A;What will happen for Burgundy ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN16.T;Parliamentarian victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN16.D;The reign of King Jean ended the day the Lower House declared against him. The troops mobilized to deal with the unrest joined the rebels. The leader of the House led the force against the Royal Palace, where Jean was forced to sign his act of abdication. He was then ordered to leave his former Kingdom with his family while the Parliament assumed control of the government. The banished King could have fought but his will had been broken this day and he always refused to support the Jeannist organisations calling for his return. He would die from a heart attack 6 years later in exile, his famous last words being : 'My country did not deserve my reign'. Meanwhile in Anvers, Liberalism thrived as the main force of Reaction had been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653035.A;A new era for Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN17.T;The return of the old Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN17.D;The orders of King Jean were swiftly executed as the troops circled the House and threatened to open fire if the traitors did not surrender. While some uprisings started in the capital, the police was able to take care of them and the Parliamentarians had to face the truth : no one would come to help them and their gambit had failed. Most surrendered, some fled, and the most radicals tried to resist only for their blood to be spilled in the Chamber. Amnisty followed for some survivors as others were thrown into jail or banished. With no resistance to oppose him, the King was able to reassert his power, controlling the government and repressing Liberals and Socialists that dared to criticize him. Nevertheless Burgundy entered a period of stability and order, built on the blood of the deputies and the liberties taken away from the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653036.A;'Je l'ay emprins';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN18.T;Crisis in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN18.D;The orders of the King were only partially executed. The Parliamentarians could count on the help of some popular rebels that diverted troops away from the Parliament and the defection of the leading general who refused to open fire on the representatives of the people. The Parliament could not threaten the domination of the King over Anvers so they fled North. Instability followed as cities erupted in riots between Monarchists and Republicans throughout the Kingdom and especially the Netherlands. Now the spectre of war looms over the Burgundian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653037.A;A house divided cannot stand ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN19.T;The Utrecht Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN19.D;The Anvers Parliamentarians fled to Utrecht which opened her doors to them. From there the remaining Liberals, from Monarchists to Radical Republicans gathered to declare King Jean to be an usurper because of his violation of the will of the people. They called on all the true Patriots to join them to end his tyrannous reign, sponsoring revolts throughout the South. Now war is sure to come in Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653038.A;True Burgundy is where our King is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653038.B;True Burgundy is in Utrecht! (PLAY AS PBG);;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN20.T;Wallonia Defects to the Parlimentarians ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN20.D;As a direct result of the Wallonian Crisis, the Wallonian regional administration, that was granted to the Parlimentarians as a concession by King Jean, has allowed the region to defect from the Jeanists to the Parlimentarian cause ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653039.A;Damn traitors! We should have never given the Parlimentarians an inch! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN21.T;Wallonia Stays loyal to the Crown ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN21.D;Despite the recent Wallonia Crisis, Wallonia has stayed loyal to the Jeanist cause. Despite the political crisis that resulted over the region, the people themselves have stayed loyal to Crown and Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653040.A;An excellent lesson: never negociate with your enemies! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN22.T;Luxembourg joins the Parliamentarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN22.D;The judgement against the Duke of Ligny Saint-Pol has emboldened the radicals in Luxembourg who have organized against King Jean for months. The newspaper founded by Rickwaert has been used as the herald of the revolution, with several issues calling on the men and women from Luxembourg to join their brethern against tyranny. The various authorities loyal to the Crown have been swept aside and the region is lost for the Jeannist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653041.A;We will prevail despite these traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN23.T;All is calm in Luxembourg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN23.D;The duke of Ligny may be an unsavory man for multiple reasons but he is a strong support of the Crown. Upon hearing the news of the Parliamentarian secession, he left his quiet isolation from his estates to rally the various people from Luxembourg who were in his debt. With his quick actions and his network the Radicalists in the area were quickly defeated and order restored in the area. The only great loss was a the 'accidental burning' of the newspaper founded by Philippe Rickwaert during the repression of a riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653042.A;A good man after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN24.T;Secession of Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN24.D;The riots inspired by the Parliamentarians following the abdication bill only grew worse after a few days. As the King fled South to organize the coming war, the local forces were quickly swept away and the whole province declared for the Parliamentarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653043.A;What has the city of the kings done ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN25.T;Restoration of order in Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN25.D;The riots inspired by the Parliamentarians following the abdication bill only grew worse in the aftermath. But even with the King fleeing south, the police and army still present in Anvers could count on the support of many port workers who remembered the Veto of the King over the relocation of the arsenal. With a few ships still present in the harbour, the whole city was soon under control and the rest of the province as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653044.A;God protects Brabant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN26.T;Flanders joins the Parliamentarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN26.D;Johan van Bosse, the former deputy of Bruges that escaped conviction for corruption took advantage of the situation to regain his popularity by attacking the King and rallying various Liberals to join the Utrecht governement. Now all Flanders stand against the rightful King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653045.A;Damn this Republican!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN27.T;Insurrection quelled in Bruges;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN27.D;The actions we took, notably by convicting the Republican Van Bosse to jail had a result on the local political scene. Liberals were weakened and the local authorities have managed to quell the few rebels that rose anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653046.A;Flanders recognize its rightful King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN28.T;Picardie secedes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN28.D;The combats between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists turned to the advantage of the former, who successfully took Arras and the other towns, with the Royal garrisons swept away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653047.A;They will see our wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN29.T;De Broglie's actions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN29.D;A candidate for becoming Prime Minister a few years ago, De Broglie went back to the army following the refusal of the King to appoint him. He was garrisoned in Calais, overseeing the Channel and drilling his troops as methodically as possible. His presence was vital to the defeat of the revolutionaries in the province as he quickly dispersed the crowds in Arras with the help of his regiments. One can only wonder what would have happened if he had not been there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653048.A;Calais is safe and it's the most important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN30.T;Rhineland joins the rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN30.D;Rhineland was already before all this a bastion of Liberalism, and the defeat of the Cologne Revolution did not change that because of the leniant policy Burgundy held afterwards. Nevertheless it felt natural to many that the Rhineland would join with the revolutionaries, and the King expressed no surprise when the flag of the rebellion was hailed throughout the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653049.A;We defeated them back in 1848, we can do it now as well !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN31.T;Rhineland supports Jean;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN31.D;Surprisingly, the areas of the former Duchy of the Rhine have stayed loyal to the Crown. Particularly important was the support of the deputy Christoph Kolbe, promoter of the Autonomous Language Act and a strong Jeannist supporter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653050.A;Well it was unexpected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN32.T;A fight to the death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN32.D;As the time for combat grows nearer the situation of the Crown appears dire, with most territories in Flanders and Wallonia in control of the revolutionaries. This state has galvanized the Jeannist, who will now fight to the death for the King and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653051.A;It's always darker before dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN33.T;A fight to the death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN33.D;As the time for combat grows nearer the situation of the Parliament appears dire, with most territories in Flanders and Wallonia in control of the Monarchists. This state has galvanized the revolutionaries, who will now fight to the death for Liberty and democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653052.A;It's always darker before dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN34.T;Strong Jeannism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN34.D;It may have given us enemies, but the Crown has always stood firm in its fight against corrupt Parliamentarians, making sure that our followers know we are the rightful cause and the most coherent one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653053.A;For God and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN35.T;Strong Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN35.D;It may not have allowed us to secure all territories in the south, but the Parliament was always stronger than the King and opposed his will. This has cemented our cause, who is widely seen as meaningful and right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653054.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN36.T;The Burgundian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN36.D;Opposition between King Jean and the Parliament of the Kingdom has seen the various territories take a side in the previous weeks between the Royalist government in the South and the Parliamentarians in Utrecht. Now the lines are drawn, loyalties are secured and both camps will fight for the future of Burgundy. King Jean declared war on the rebels, beginning his 'march on Utrecht' and now it can only end in the victory of one side over the other, or the death of Burgundy as the world has known it for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653055.A;Who could have thought that it would end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN37.T;The Second Rhine Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN37.D;As war erupted between the Monarchists and Parliamentarians- Rhenish radicals have successfully rekindled the flame of the First Rhine Revolution and caused the region  to explode into yet another revolution. Exiles from 1848, along with countless youngmen from Germany have flooded back to the Republic to take up arms against the Burgundian Tyranny. The guns would fall silent soon after the region had been secured though, as unlike the First Rhine Revolution, the chaos of the Burgundian Civil War has resulted in a complete impossibility for Jean or Anvers to take back the Rhineland. At least for now..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653056.A;$COUNTRY$ will return to the Rhineland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN38.T;Trouble in Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN38.D;Brabantian radicals are an important part of our war-coalition, and our control over most of the region has reinforced their cause. Sadly many are staunch Republicans that are not content with the state of our revolution, asking for a Republican proclamation. These divisions have in the last days become dire as the Brabantian republican leader Richard de Craene has gone back to Anvers, leaving the Utrecht assembly. It is hard to believe he will take action that could threaten the Revolution but Brabant could revolt against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653057.A;It would be a suicide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN39.T;The Brabantian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN39.D;Our fears were true. De Craene has levied the Brabantian flag in Anvers calling for an end of Burgundy and an independent democratic Netherlands. His call has been heard in all Brabant and also Friesland, where the Frisian have also declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653058.A;We must win at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN40.T;Victory of the Parliamentarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN40.D;The Civil War has finally ended : the Parliament of Utrecht and their supporters finally toppled King Jean and secured the southern parts of the country. King Jean has been banished from the country with many of its followers. Many challenges await the new Burgundy : the Liberal coalition that held during the war could break now over the status of the state, many moderates wanting to crown another King to the disgust of many Dutch republicans. But anyway for now, Jeannism as a political force has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653059.A;For the people of Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN41.T;Victory of the Burgundian Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN41.D;After months of fighting, the Burgundian civil war has now ended as the Parliament of Utrecht has submitted in front of the King and his armies. Burgundy is now reunited under her rightful monarch that will ensure that the country will never bow down to others. Repression is harsh, as most of the leading Liberal figures are banished or sent to prison for treason. The new Parliament convoked by the King is mainly filled by loyal men who will not do any thing to provoke the wrath of the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653060.A;Liberalism will not weaken Burgundy anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN42.T;Anarchy in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN42.D;The Civil War ended indecisively as King Jean suffered a stroke that cut the leadership of the Royalist cause while the divisions between the Parliamentarians were proven too strong to present a united front. A white peace was agreed, that led to the fracture of the Burgundian authority everywhere. A regency for King Jean based in Lorraine will continue but it has lost all authority beyond this area : Flanders, Netherlands, Friesland and Rhineland now are governed by a cabal of generals whose loyalties are unclear. It is the end of 400 years of Burgundy existing in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653061.A;Everything has an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN43.T;The Brabantian Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN43.D;Unexpectedly, the Brabantian revolution forced both the Parliamentarians and the Monarchists to recognize their independent government. This has broken the unity of the Monarchists who must now recognize a new state in the North, with various regions declaring independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To dispel any attacks, King Jean has decided in a surprising move to legally change the name of the royal family in honour the town of Bouillon, where he has acquired a castle in remembrance of the hero of the First Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG44.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRG44.D;Burgundy has lost the Netherlands. As the head of this national humiliation, King Jean's palace was overrun by a mob led by several Republican leaders, and following a relatively bloodless Republican coup a provisional Republic has been set up in Burgundy. This is a great blow to the Burgundian effort, and one that Burgundy may not recover from for a long time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653110.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG45.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRG45.D;In the Anglo-Burgundian war, a result of decades of animosity and sabre-rattling, Burgundy has been totally defeated by the Anglois state. The Staatsvlag has been lowered at the Estates-General for the last time, the King has fled the country and any remaining Jeanists have faded into immediate obscurity. In the shadow of this defeat, a coup took place which installed a parliamentary republic in Burgundy. The centuries-old balance of power in Western Europe has been broken, and will likely not return to stability for a long time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

rhone_dispatch_title;The Plombières Dispatch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rhone_dispatch_desc;For many years the Burgundian monarchy has kept in contact with several important figures in Occitania like the Bourbon family as to ensure their success in claiming the Arles kingdom and a Mediterranean port. Recently, the Anglois have grown resentful of these meetings and it seems that it could be easy to engineer a diplomatic incident while the King is in the bath town of Plombières and make Paris take an agressive stance in this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tear_up_plombieres_title;Tear up the Treaty of Fontainebleau;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This stain on our country and on our history must be eradicated, no matter the consequences. And Holland, Frisia, and all other essential regions for our country must be reintegrated, no matter the hardships we have to endure. Je maintiendrai l’honneur, la foy, la loy, de Dieu et du Roy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG46.T;The ‘Arras Plans’;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG46.D;King Jean of Burgundy was visiting the bath town of Plombières in Lorraine when the Anglois general Louis de Bourbon-Bellegarde announced his defection to Burgundy and brought with him the so-called Arras Plans. According to this military intelligence, the Anglois army had been preparing an aggressive attack for years following the Burgundian Civil War, wanting to strike as soon as possible to dismantle the Burgundian monarchy. Or so the Plans said, as many believe them to be authentic. The King and his government denounced the Parisian endeavors and sent ambassadors for the Western European countries to form a resistance league against Anglois imperialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653112.A;And so the plot begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG47.T;Anglois Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG47.D;The reveal of Anglois military intelligence by the general Bourbon-Bellegarde has shaken the continent. Many had believed that Paris would abstain from reckless behaviour given how King Jean has acted in the recent years but these plans defy all previous assumptions. It seems to many officials that we must help Burgundy against the coming Anglois aggression or at least abstain from helping the Anglois agressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653113.A;We stand with Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653113.B;These documents look shady to me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG48.T;The Bourbon-Bellegarde treason;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG48.D;The general of Bourbon-Bellegarde has defected to Burgundy, citing our oppression of Occitania as a stain upon his honor. He then publicly revealed to the press the ‘Arras Plans’, a series of military intelligence documents that paint our government as warmongering and ready to strike as soon as possible against the Burgundian threat. While it is true that we had been preparing for wae against Burgundy, these Arras Plans are fake according to our high-staff. Nevertheless, the crowds demand a reaction and we have asked Burgundy to deliver the traitor to us or face consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653115.A;Does this mean war ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG49.T;End of ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG49.D;Our demands have not been met by Burgundy who has been mobilizing and citing our army movements to prove the reality of the Arras Plans. Meanwhile the general population demands war with several demonstrations in the streets and plenty of critiques within the Estates-General from the opposition and members of our own party. And so we go to war as agressors, but our might is enough to vanquish the Burgundians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653116.A;To Anvers lads !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG50.T;The Treaty of Fontainebleau;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG50.D;The Anglois armies have been defeated by Burgundy who now stands as the strongest power of Western Europe. Signed in the old royal castle of Fontainebleau, the treaty sees Burgundy gain the old Kingdom of Arles, part of the Burgundian Crown according to the Nationalists while extracting several other compensations from $THISCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG52.D;Burgundian machinations and plots have backfired as the Anglois armies marched through Bourgogne and Flanders and defeated the veterans from the Civil War. Now the war has ended and Burgundy is forced to let go of Bourgogne and Calais, old territories claimed by the King of France and England since the XVIth century. Moreover, the responsibility of war goes to Burgundy as Bourbon-Bellegarde acknowledged being part of a malevolent plot that would have seen crowned grand-duke of Toulouse should the Burgundians have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Neither side was able to win during the war that saw thousands die only for the glory of their respective nations.

PBG_alliance_with_ARI_desc;The Kingdom of Aragon has been a traditional and loyal ally of Burgundy throughout their common history and the rapid expansion of the Crown of Aragon to include a restored Italian Kingdom was the culmination of their ongoing effort. This undeniably shocked Paris which cower in fear as their Mediterranean naval dominance and hegemony over the Provençal people of their South is actively threatened for the first time since the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614). While this new union surely offset the balance of power of Europe, it has been a boon to our geopolitical efforts to isolate the Anglo-French threat, and an alliance of friendship would most definitely further secure our respective place in Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PBG_alliance_with_OCC_title;The Treaty of Lyon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PBG_alliance_with_OCC_desc;The history of interactions between the modern Provençal and Burgundians is intricate and complex, though it has always been a history of friendship and mutual trust: Burgundy tried to protect the independence of the County of Foix and Béarn in 1516, was an ally of Valois Provence during the Languedoc War (1532), and protected the rights of the Protestants of Occitania against the Anglo-French aggressor during the Wars of Religion (1598-1614), and finally during the Anglo-French Wars of Succession (1768-1771). United in religion, culture, and perceived threats, an alliance between our two nations is a natural way of bringing our common history against the aggressors of Paris to an end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But the Western Tour of the Princes that followed the Treaty of Paris that ended the German Wars made a great impression on some Burgundian diplomats who saw a potential in these potentates to achieve a great power in the East. And now they have risen to become a vast empire which would be useful to our interests.

EVTDESC334707;We have beaten back the Shogunate pretenders and declared ourselves the sole rulers of Japan and Korea. Furthermore, the Emperor has decreed that with the total defeat of the Han kindai-ka undo- it would be now possible to accelerate the modernization of Japan and heavily reform the government to one that is more suited of this era. The Sun shall rise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB334707;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME334714;The Stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC334714;Unfortunately the Shogunate has failed to take back Japan and has been forced into a premature peace. However, rather then continue his campaign against Japan. A clique of dissatisfied Korean nationalists and Republican figures have abruptly coup d'etat the Shogunate and removed him from power. The hermit kingdom has ended and the Korean Republic has been declared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB334714;We should have seen this coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME334715;Creation of the Korean Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC334715;Emperor Komei has been left in horrid position where it is for all intents and purposes impossible to directly rule over Korea without any potential independence revolt popping up and promptly kicking Japan out of Korea. A alternative plan regarding the creation of a highly subservient Korean Protectorate has been drafted and for now it seems as if this is the only way where Japan will be able to keep Korea. Indeed, many do see this as dishonourable but if there was any other possible way to keep Korea without a potentially destructive revolt while our nation has been left in a extremely broken state then Komei would do that instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB334715;At least they are still our subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME334716;The Unthinkable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC334716;We have lost control of one of the semi-independent domains and been unable to recover it. This is extremely dishonourable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB334716;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

the_last_stand_PLC_desc;The Hohenzollern King has outed the intentions of the nobility and foreign nations to the general public and parties of the Commonwealth and this has sent them into a complete fury. This shall be nothing less then a total war for the survival of the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_serfdom_PLC_title;Destroy Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_serfdom_PLC_desc;Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. A good portion of the Commonwealth's Economy has been eternally tied into this outdated system, kept back by a nobility with far too much power for the modern era. Now that we have curtailed their power we can finally do what has needed to be done for over a hundred years now and end this terrible curse. Let the Commonwealth prosper forever more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
nat_poland_title;Adopt Nationalist Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nat_poland_desc;The Polish nation has long been the light of civilization for Eastern Europe. We created uniatry, we spread science and technology, and how have our ungrateful "friends" repaid us? It will not happen again! Only fascism can bring freedom to Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rev_poland_title;Adopt Revolutionary Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rev_poland_desc;For too long we have been mere "cattle" to our masters.The noble working people of Poland have risen up against the old orders, and our new, socialist, state is preparing to pay back the feudal oppressors for all they have done for centuries. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#the_belarussian_claim_LIT_title;The Belarusian Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#the_belarussian_claim_LIT_desc;The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had integrated the former Principality of Polotsk in its early years of existence to defend them from the continued brunt of the Mongol invasions. Therefore it is due to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that the Belarusian people even exist and with the collapse of the Commonwealth we must claim all the territory in where they have settled in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
restore_the_grand_duchy_LIT_title;Restore the Grand Duchy Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
restore_the_grand_duchy_LIT_desc;With the ascension of $COUNTRY$ to international relevency and a loose, but ultimately rightful claim on the rest of Ruthenia. It should be now possible to restore $COUNTRY$ to its fifteenth century borders once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NATPOLpolishempire_title;The Polish Diaspora;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NATPOLpolishempire_desc;As $COUNTRY$ has returned to its status as a greater power of Europe once again- it must make its imperative that of claiming all territories of the Polish diaspora in Europe. Never again shall the Polish live under a country that is not their rightful motherland! WARNING: Will remove the ability to form the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLclaimsilesia_title;The Silesian Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLclaimsilesia_desc;The Silesian Piasts had broken off the Kindgom of Poland during their insane attempt to claim the entire Kingdom for their own in the 12th Century. Rather then accept defeat they decided to beg to the Holy Roman Emperor for vassalization. This was a betrayal of the highest level and one of the single most catastrophic failures in Polish History, dooming countless Poles to German rule. The Kingdom had continued to claim the territory before Casimir III (the Jew) signed a treaty that would result in its permanent integration into the Kindgom of Bohemia. As Casimir III was clearly not sound of mind when he signed this disguising treaty, we formally repudiate the Treaty of Trentschin and claim Silesia as rightful polish territory once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLpiastkingdom_title;The Piast Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLpiastkingdom_desc;The Piasts were the semi-legendary founders of the Kingdom of Poland that possessed territory as far as the modern Oder River. However, after several centuries of a expansionist Holy Roman Empire the Polish were ultimately pushed back and replaced by German settlers that rapidly germanized the territory. As our glorious ultranationalist state is the rightful inheritors to the Kingdom of Poland, we must undo this injustice and liberate the territory that is rightfully ours. For Lech and the Polish People!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

all_the_commonwealths_title;All the Commonwealths;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
all_the_commonwealths_desc;The Peoples of the Commonwealth stand united against the threats of their enemies. After decades of humiliation and decadence, our Union has been shaped anew to prosper in the coming centuries. In the chamber of the Great Sejm, the representatives of the Ruthenian Voivdeships vocally ask for the reunification with their brothers across the frontier. In Livonia and Moldavia, the hatred for inept and unjust rule has created a wide support for integration into our Union. These voices shall not fall unheard! The Rzeczpospolita resurges!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
greater_commonwealth_title;Reclaim the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
greater_commonwealth_desc;During the 1839-1840 Sejm, the Commonwealth had encountered troubles in the east that had ultimately resulted in a great deal of the territory permanently leaving the Commonwealth. Through noble conspiracy and political abuse it was impossible to reclaim this territory but now that the nobility have been curtailed and the union has been successfully federalized through the new Treaty of Lublin, The Commonwealth should now be able to embark of a reconquest of its rightful territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
liberum_veto;Liberum Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
liberum_veto_desc;Nie pozwalam! - Thus any chance of a aggressive war has ended. Do not justify on civilized nations until the nobility has been curtailed if you do not wish to receive this modifier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC_inevitable_sejm;The Inevitable Sejm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC_inevitable_sejm_desc;Maximilian III has been dying for some time now and the Sejm is starting fight between themselves regarding whom the next king should be. It is unlikely that any wars will be possible until this stalemate is resolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME222240;Liberum Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC222240;The discussions regarding a soon-to-be offensive war have been permanently stalled as a single greater noble screams out the eternally cursed words- Nie pozwalam! or "I do not allow". Thus- as in all sessions of the polish sejm when this is stated: the deliberation and debate comes to a complete halt and all legislation is for all intents and purposes nullified. So long as the nobility remain at such an incredible level of power in the Commonwealth, it is unlikely that any offensive wars will be possible beyond that of colonial expeditions in so-called uncivilized countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA222240;The bastards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22233;The Failed Dissolution of the Sejm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22233;The King of the Commonwealth had entered the Sejm with the intent to dissolve it and appoint a new party, but he was abruptly reminded that the Golden Liberties given to the "people" of the Commonwealth do not allow such a action to take place. The King would leave the Sejm- embarrassed in his inability to act in a manner that could benefit the decaying Commonwealth. It is clear that he will have to wait for a oppitunity to deprive the nobility of their so called "Golden Liberties".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC22.T;Prussia leaves the Commonwealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC22.D;The problems in the coordination of power caused by the March Revolution greatly alarmed the Duchy of Prussia. Today they have declared that they do not recognize the new government and are severing all ties with Warsaw. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC23.T;The East Withdraws;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC23.D;The inability for the Commonwealth to manage the problems in Smolensk has led to a complete loss of influence in the East. The Cossacks have stopped reporting to the registry, and begun to pursue an independent policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#### The Good Sejm - Russia do not Exists ####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC24.T;Our King is Dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC24.D;Our beloved King has died in his sleep tonight. While Kashtelan is preparing the funeral, Convocation sejm is preparing the election of the new monarch. In recent decades, the situation in our Commonwealth has been extremely unstable, and many fear that this Sejm may be the last... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC25.T;The Convocation Sejm Convenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC25.D;This early morning, the Election sejm opened it's doors for the szlachta who is ready to take part in the election of their new King. Archbishop of Gniezno opened the Sejm by prayer, Marszalek was chosen, and this marked the opening of several days of endless intrigue, bribery and pressure to attract voters from all over the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC27.T;The Bohemian Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC27.D;The informants could not lie. Something was deffinitely wrong at this Sejm. Organized attempts to disrupt the voting with petty scuffles, the long failure to come to unanimous choise, despite the fact that majority clearly supported the winning candidate. After a series of investigations, everything became clear - the Emperor of Bohemia had drawn to his side a huge number of Polish nobles, who for the sake of money or promises of power were ready to disrupt the Sejm. Now, the source of the past strife has become quite clear - the Polish szlachta is rotten because of corruption, greed, and disloyalty to their own Crown. The time has come to rectify this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC27.A;Nie pozwalam ci byc zdrajca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.T;The Szlactha Purge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.D;The order for the guard was quite clear: to arrest about 750 noblemen together with their families and cronies on charges of high treason. Although most of the list had already left the Sejm, the arrest of those who remained gave the entire szlachta a clear message: the King would not tolerate foreign agents within the nobility of his state. The arrested estates, mills, and other industries were, of course, commandeered at the expense of the treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.A;Down with traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC29.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC29.D;After the arrest of disloyal noblemen and their replacement in the Sejm by representatives of the bourgeoisie and petty nobility loyal to their King, the Sejm took the first step toward the reform of our glorious Commonwealth. The Constitution, the first draft of which was approved by the Sejm, divides the Sejm into two chambers: Sejm Rzeczypospolitej, elected by a popular secret vote, and the Senate, appointed by the King from the representatives of the provinces and large cities. This Constitution also guarantees freedom of the press, assembly, and workers' self organization. In Europe and the New World, this Constitution is already being called the most liberal in the World, which has greatly increased the prestige of our monarchy among international community. Despite the displeasure of the reactionaries, this Constitution will serve as the first step toward the true unification of the nations of the Commonwealth into one state, strong and independent among great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

### Polish Nationalist Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.T;The Concept of a Polish Nation State;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.D;We live in an age of nationalism, and it is obvious to every reasonable ruler that to hold his state together it is necessary to create one nation that will speak and think in one language, read same newspapers, and, of course, love only one King. Today, King Augustyn proclaimed the beginning of a policy of "polonification," which is designed to create a single, consolidated nation based on Polish education and the Polish way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.A;One Nation, One Commonwealth, One King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.T;Abolishment of the Lithuanian Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.D;Today, at a meeting of the Sejm, the first step toward the unity of the Commonwealth of the Polish Nation was taken. Overriding the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's veto would rid us of the pesky Lithuanian nobility, which had already begun to resist our policy of polonification. This is a very unpleasant, but still a necessary step for the unity of the country, and we will make everyone accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.A;...the abolishment of Veto has been vetoed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.T;Forced abolishment of the Lithuanian Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.D;After a small embarrassment of overriding the Lithuanian veto, all Lithuanian deputies were escorted out of the meeting room. The king expressed his regrets over this, but also noted that such steps were necessary to preserve the unity of the state and its stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.A;Necessary sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.T;The Polonization Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.D;The law passed by the Sejm today can be called truly historic. From this day forward, all public education in languages other than Polish will be forbidden. It is also forbidden to publish newspapers, documents, and communication in the army in languages other than Polish. However, these laws caused discontent in those regions and army units where the majority are not Poles. Despite this, the Commonwealth of the Polish Nation is ready to take up any challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.A;I don't like where this is going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.T;Grand Duchy of Lithuania Proclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.D;The laws on polonification have definitively eroded the weak unity that institutionally and historically bound the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania together. Lithuania's withdrawal from the Commonwealth was the natural outcome of all the pressure that Poland began to put on the other territories. From now on, the Commonwealth of the Two Nations is just a fiction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.A;Sic transit gloria mundi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC350.T;The Warsaw Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC350.D;"Centralization, unification and the creation of a unified Polish state are absolutely necessary. In our time of instability and the disintegration of the old monarchies, only nationalism, true nationalism, can save our people. God has blessed us with a King who understands the challengeshe faces. Those who still today call themselves Ruthenians, Jews, Germans or Prussians will already be Poles tomorrow. This is not a threat, but an offer: an offer to walk together into the future as one." This speech from a famous Polish intellectual, reprinted by all the newspapers, was called the "Warsaw Speech" and de facto reflects all the intentions of the new state. The formal dissolution of the Commonwealth and the proclamation of an independent Kingdom of Poland is a progress, liberation out of the old feudal fetters hindering our nation. Onward to Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

### Hohenzollern Radical Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.T;The Great Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.D;It was obvious to King Adolf. His men delivered him all the proof he needed. The Bohemian and Russian emperors had indeed bought - with money or promises of power, almost the entire nobility of the Kingdom of Poland. All that nobility, which was supposed to be the foundation of the state, betrayed the Commonwealth and its King. At today's meeting of the Sejm, the King accused all the conspirators by name. Those who were present in the hall were immediately arrested, and the rest fled far away to Kyiv. Instead of noblemen traitors, the King filled the Sejm with men loyal to him from merchants, administrators and churchmen, who must now put an end to the Great Conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.A;Out with traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC42.T;Prussia goes silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,  
PLC42.D;We received a letter from Prussia. In the letter, the Prussian government declares its renunciation of all treaties with the Commonwealth and declares its complete independence and neutrality toward it. All Polish representatives will be expelled from Prussia, and all Prussian subjects are to return home immediately. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC42.A;Take hostages before they leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.T;The Sejm of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.D;Those traitors who fled to Kyiv had the nerve to assemble their own Sejm. At the Sejm they elected as king a miserable man, not even worthy to be called by name. We have made it clear to other countries that this "king" is only a pawn of Bohemia and Russia, while the true king of the Commonwealth is Adolf August.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.A;The Conspiracy is now clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.T;Exposing our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.D;Today, diplomatic notes were sent to the emperors of Bohemia and Russia. Although, one might rather call these not notes, but insults. In these notes, the King exposed their intrigues against the Commonwealth, and assured them that the Commonwealth is stronger than ever and would stand up to any aggression from their miserable states. General mobilization is declared throughout the country, and the generals are ordered to prepare for war. Some half-whispered this as a diplomatic disaster, but their voices are quickly silenced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.A;We do not fear you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.T;Bohemian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.D;"In view of King Adolf's intolerable rhetoric, threats, and blatant aggression toward His Majesty the Emperor and His Crown, His Majesty the Emperor sees no alternative but to declare war on the Commonwealth". A note with these contents was received today by our ambassador from the diplomatic service of the Emperor of Bohemia. The outposts on the western frontier are already reporting an approaching enemy, and evacuation has already begun in the cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.A;Fight, you cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.T;Russian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.D;Our units on the eastern border report large Russian troops heading west. This is war, and we must hold out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.A;Fight, you cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.T;Treaty of Kalusz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.D;Today, in the small town of Kalush in Galicia, a long-awaited peace was signed between the Commonwealth on the one hand, and Russia and Bohemia on the other, putting an end to the bloody war that the vile enemies unleashed against our state. The false "King" is nowhere to be seen, and his supporters were detained and hanged. Our, tired of war, are nevertheless happy to emerge victorious from it and are already beginning to praise their king. A new era in the history of the Commonwealth begins, an era in which external enemies are put to the foot and internal ones destroyed. Hooray to King Adolf August!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.A;May his reign be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.T;Disaster of the 'The War of Adolf';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.D;That can'tbe... The armies of the Commonwealth are completely destroyed. The cities are occupied. Forts blown up. Traitorous nobles are already declaring the independence of their worthless countries, and our own subjects are looting and murdering loyalists in a rage. In this situation, Adolphus Augustus felt like it was a dream, or a nightmare. The king did not believe it was possible. And His Majesty saw only one way out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.A;A shot rang out across Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
###Third Sejm###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC49.T;The Convocation Sejm Convenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC49.D;This early morning, the Election sejm opened it's doors for the szlachta who is ready to take part in the election of their new King. Archbishop of Gniezno opened the Sejm by prayer, Marszalek was chosen, and this marked the opening of several days of endless intrigue, bribery and pressure to attract voters from all over the Commonwealth. Election has passed smoothely, and the winner is:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC50.T;The Truth about Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC50.D;The informants could not lie. Something was definitely wrong at this Sejm. Organized attempts to disrupt the voting with petty scuffles, the long failure to come to unanimous choise, despite the fact that majority clearly supported the winning candidate. After a series of investigations, everything became clear - the Emperor of Bohemia had drawn to his side a huge number of Polish nobles, who for the sake of money or promises of power were ready to disrupt the Sejm. Now, the source of the past strife has become quite clear - the Polish szlachta is rotten because of corruption, greed, and disloyalty to their own Crown. The time has come to rectify this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC50.A;Your treachery is done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.T;Warsaw falls into anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.D;It went... Not the way we intended. Instead of Guardsmen ready to arrest traitors, we have corrupt lazybones who were bought very cheaply. Some traitors have begun to fight back, and the crowds in the streets of Warsaw are already smashing up the mansions of the large szlachta in the hope of getting their hands on the property of those who have been killed, escaped, or are in prison. Worse than that, the wave of riots has raised  all kinds of radicals, and red flags and appeals to hang all the szlachta from the trees are already flying in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.A;Yeah... Get my carriage ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.T;Reign of Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.D;Disaster. Across the country, estates are in flames. Every nobleman who has not yet fled the country hides in secret shelters, or, disguised, lives in the city dumpsters pretending to be a pauper. "Wealth," "nobility," and "title" have become the worst curses in these few weeks. Commoners happily remove furniture from the estates and burn the buildings themselves as symbols of oppressors and traitors. The king does not react at all to what is happening, causing aggression from his seemingly most reactionary and conservative supporters. However, this has a plus side - all the nobles, bought by Bohemia or not, are withdrawn from political affairs, and the King can replace them in the Sejm with people loyal to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.A;Our nobility is gone now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.T;New Dawn of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.D;The terror had come to an end. While the mob rampaged through the streets, the King and his fully loyal Sejm were able to prepare a new constitution - a liberal constitution respectful of every Commonwealth citizen, not just the nobility. Event if this incured the displeasure of the reactionaries, this Constitution will serve as the first step toward the true unification of the nations of the Commonwealth into one state, strong and independent among great powers. Despite all the horror that our country has endured, we can now look to the future with cautious confidence, with hope that this will not happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.A;Happy end?..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#The Deluge - Monarchy is lost before nobility is purged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC54.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC54.D;Our ancient monarchy, the institution that bound the Commonwealth, is gone. Along with the monarchy, gone is the illusion of stability that our society has been living with in recent years. The insurgents rampaging all over Poland proved the government's complete inability to keep the situation under control. One by one, our dependent territories began to declare their independence, frightened by what was happening in the metropolis. The Commonwealth was dissolved, not de-jure, but de-facto, and now our homeland awaits terrible times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC54.A;Discordia maximae dilabuntur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC55.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC55.D;With the loss of one of our substate, the world has become convinced of the Crown's inability to maintain even the illusion of stability in the Commonwealth. An outraged military overthrew the monarchy, but that only made things worse. One by one our substates are declaring independence and break any connections with the government in Warsaw. We are now facing the worst crisis in our history, and in this troubled times, we can rely only on God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC55.A;Discordia maximae dilabuntur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.D;Modern problems require modern solutions. Unfortunately, our system could not provide these solutions. Having lived through the turbulent 19th century, our Commonwealth could learn no lessons from it. Largely feudal, without a strong government, it is falling under the weight of its problems. Various nationalists and radicals are arming themselves and taking power in our lands, and we have no way to fight them. The Commonwealth can be considered as no longer existing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.A;Discordia maximae dilabuntur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC56.T;The End of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC56.D;The inability for Poland to secure its most vital territories in the recent crisis has resulted in it finally succumbing under the weight of its own contradictions. A final Sejm was called with the intent to stabilze the political situation in the country but it is clear by now that absolutely everyone blames Warsaw for its catastropic mismanagement that had lead to this horrific circumstance. Greater and a good deal of Lesser Poland both prefering to make deals with the Germans in the west then stand another minute of this utter disgrace of a nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC59.D;The new government was unable to defend even its own territories.

Unfortunately, due to the rapid decline of the Commonwealth: Lithuania has somehow regained its autonomy and fallen directly into the sphere of the Scandinavians. However with our rise as a notable Eastern European power once again, we should be able to reaffirm the old treaty and annex Lithuania directly back into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

declare_commonwealth_dead_desc;For centuries, the Poles of the Commonwealth have meddled in the affairs of Russia.  And for centuries, the princes of Russia have endured the humiliation they had wrought upon us. But no longer! Once her greatest enemy, the Commonwealth today grovels at the feet of Mother Russia. By force of arms the once-mighty Commonwealth will be declared dissolved, never again to mar the maps of Europe.  \n \n Arise, you mighty motherland, to your rightful place as the hegemon of Eastern Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

declare_commonwealth_dead_RUT_desc;For centuries, the Poles of the Commonwealth have forced the Ruthenians to toil in serfdom under their disgraceful nobility. And for centuries the Ruthenian people have endured the humiliation of having their religion and culture slowly polonified out of existence. But no longer! The Commonwealth lies in ruins and the Ruthenians that had once been her slaves are now free to declare the final death of the Commonwealth, and that it shall never again mar the maps of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

form_ruthenia_desc;The Kievan Rus was known as the peak of so-called Ruthenian Civilization- A great empire that stretched from Odessa to Karelia that ruled from Kiev. However, with the arrival of the Mongol Empire the fate of Eastern Europe was forever changed and the Kievian Rus could never be restored again at its original borders. Kiev could still be the centre of a great empire once again, but one that unites what are now known as the Ruthenians- rather then that of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

claim_yedisan_desc;$COUNTRY$ is landlocked and this severely limits what we are capable of as a nation.

RUT4.T;The Council of Kiev;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT4.D;Russia has supplied us with a ludicrous quantity of equipment and supplies and has promised to immediately surrender all "rightfully Ukrainian territory" with the intention of inciting a large scale Ukranian Revolt. The continued insistence on a political status quo has left our nation poor and decrepit and most agree that it would be better if the Ukranians were to leave and become its own independent nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222416.A;Tell Russia that we accept their plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222416.B;Stick with the Polish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#RUT5.T;The Kiev Council - Belarus Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#RUT5.D;There has been a council in Kiev in response to Russia's direct involvement in Ruthenian Politics. The council has agreed that with Russian support they may be able to break free of the Commonwealth and form their own nation known as Ruthenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#222417.A;Join our brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#222417.B;Stick with the Polish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#222417.C;For Ruthenia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT6.T;The Ruthenia Plot - Part Two;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT6.D;The Malorussians have agreed with our plan (and our bribes) and now we have moved onto stage two of this plan. We must send a immediate memorandum to the Central Europeans to gather their support for this plot or run the risk of their support of the Commonwealth potentially nullifying this plot. The promise of disputed territories such as Prussia, Pommern and Danzig should be good enough to ensure their support. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222418.A;They shall been informed immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT7.T;The Ruthenia Plot - Part Three;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT7.D;The Central Europeans have agreed with our plan to dismantle the Commonwealth and we should have no further disruption from them. Its time to end this farce and tell Kiev to send the independence ultimatum to Warsaw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222419.A;Lets slip the dogs of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT8.T;The Formation of Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT8.D;Russia has given us the go-ahead and has granted us the promised territories. We may now send a ultimatum to the Commonwealth regarding our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222420.A;...and thus it has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT9.T;Russian Annexation of Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RUT9.D;During the Sejm regarding the partition of Poland; Russia has decided almost instantaneously to backstab us and speak as if we should be immediately annexed into the Empire. All other parties at the Conference agree and since the Commonwealth is not in a position to support us any more, we have been forced into a situation where we must either submit or attempt to fight back the Russian menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222421.A;We must submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
222421.B;This is a betrayal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POL11.T;The Ruthenia Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL11.D;The creation of a unified Russian state might have been a proud moment for $COUNTRY$, if not for the fact that its influence towards the Ruthenian peoples are limited due to the existence of a disgusting barely-stable mess of a "nation" known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to our influence in their last Sejm we have able to get a incompetent idiot on their throne which leaves the Uman Confederation open for influence. If we pull the right cords and promise them the territories of the former Dnieper Host in exchange for a legitimate deceleration of independence from the Commonwealth. We could persuade the nations of Central Europe that a "partition" is in order to stabilize Eastern Europe by using the "plight" of the Kievians as a example. We will supply and ultimately directly support this revolution if the Commonwealth refuses to pull out and use it as a justification to Central Europe for a partition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222390.A;Its time to heat things up in Ruthenia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222390.B;Incite a nationalist revolt? Are you MAD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.T;The Ruthenia Plot - Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.D;Russia has sent a letter in regards to the fate of the Commonwealth. A letter which proclaims that they intend to support a Ukrainian Revolt to prevent further instability in the region and promise us all the historically disputed territories in the western commonwealth if we support their efforts. $COUNTRY$ will be finally able to obtain Danzig, Pommern and Prussia without having to commit to any form of large war with the Commonwealth. This will likely be our only chance to retrieve them with such ease as attempting to retrieve them outside of this "legal partition" will count as a illegal conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.A;The Russians are right. Begin the proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.B;The Russians are insane. We shall have no part in this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.T;The Ruthenia Plot - A Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.D;We have been sent a letter from the Hetmanate, the Russian Empire and any interested German State on the matter of our national stability. We are to immediately remove our armies from the Uman Confederation, Danzig, "Belarus" and Pommern and allow them to call a Sjem on the matter of "A Polish Partition" which will grant the newly formed "Malorussia" independence and put "unstable territories" in the care of appropriate nations. We will be permitted to keep Lithuania as a integrated part of the Commonwealth but we will immediately lose the Ukraine, Belarus, Pommern, Prussia and Pomerelia. If we refuse and attempt to reconquer the Ukraine then "they" will take military action- ALL OF THEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.A;We have no choice. If we tried to fight it is likely that we would be utterly destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.B;The Commonwealth shall not stand by and allow this to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.T;The Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.D;A Sjem has been called in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by external nations regarding the stability of its territories and to ratify a new constitution. It (the Sjem) has concluded that the current state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is unacceptable and that its territories must be reorganized according to the wishes of Russia and varied Central European powers. Critics of this event are calling it a blatant attempt by Russia and Central European powers to annex Commonwealth territory and that it will not increase the stability of Eastern Europe, but in an ironic twist of fate has at least finally inadvertently curtailed the nobility that has been plaguing the Commonwealth for decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222393.A;The bear better not come back for another meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.T;Annexation of Commonwealth Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.D;$COUNTRY$ has been granted territories as a result of various treaties and the ongoing collapse of the Commonwealth. We are the most viable option as the nobility in these states have been petitioning for immediate vassalization or annexation by $COUNTRY$ rather then any others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222395.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.T;The Annexation of Royal Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.D;$COUNTRY$ has been granted territories as a result of various treaties and the ongoing collapse of the Commonwealth. This particular territory is known as "Royal Prussia" which had originally been owned by the State of the Teutonic Order before it was annexed by the Commonwealth. The next goal of $COUNTRY$ should be the annexation of Danzig and finally the crown jewel of the region- Prussia itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222394.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL17.T;A Second Partition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL17.D;We have left Poland in a exceptionally weak state after the first partition and so this may be our chance to finally dissolve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for good with little or no cost to us at all. All we have to do is promise the nobility the restoration of their rights that they had lost during the aftermath of the First Sejm and that should cause enough of a catastrophe to tear the Commonwealth to pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.A;Send a letter to the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.B;We did enough in the First Partition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.T;The Second Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.D;The Government of Polish-Lithuania was left with a fatal flaw after the first partition. That being the fact that the nobility had been stripped of their "Golden Liberties" which had resulted in the immediate abolition of Serfdom, this would be a great boon in any other time period but with the external manipulations of Russia their "struggle" had been reignited. They had called a illegal Sejm in the city of Lwow and had called for the immediate dissolution of the Commonwealth to secure their so called rights "as given by god". The Commonwealth was unable to stop the troops that had already marched across its borders to secure treasonous noble estates and was forced to concede to the demands of the Sejm and the foreign nations seeking further territory and vassals. The Union of Lublin is broken. The Commonwealth is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222398.A;TRAITORS. THEY ARE ALL TRAITORS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL20.T;The Creation of Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL20.D;$COUNTRY$ has been petitioned to annex a large swath of Polish territory from the former Commonwealth by the nobility in the region to compensate for their losses incurred in the destruction of the Commonwealth.  As it is impossible to administrate this much territory directly, we have created a nation called Galicia to administrate this territory for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222399.A;Galicia shall be a useful puppet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL21.T;Commonwealth Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL21.D;Due to a set of varied and complex reasons the Commonwealth has lost control of several states. The nobility in these states are presently petitioning for immediate vassalization or annexation by $COUNTRY$ as it is the best possible choice with the neighbouring territories that $COUNTRY$ currently possesses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222400.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL22.T;The Destruction of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL22.D;Several years after the end of the Commonwealth, it has been made abundantly clear that Polish nationalism is nothing less then a extreme threat to Russian stability and that the concept of Poland as a whole is doing nothing more then weakening our nation state and allowing us to be threatened by other nations in the region. It is time to end our façade of ever caring about the plight of the Polish people and rather taking the path of utterly dissolving the Polish nation from existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.A;Poland shall die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.B;This is insanity. Stop! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.T;The Final Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.D;Russia has presented us with a ultimatum to immediately surrender our sovereignty to them in a act of blatant imperialism. If we surrender then Poland is effectively a dead nation, ready to be replaced by whatever puppet state that the Russians have come up with to replace Poland. If we don't surrender, we will be invaded and forced to fight a futile war. Its time for the final stand of Poland, are you willing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222402.A;POLAND IS NOT YET LOST!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222402.B;POLAND IS NOT YE.... what do you mean they own our economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.T;Poland Wins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.D;In a crushing blow for Russian prestige, Poland and its allies have defeated the Russian Army and prevented the final partition of Poland. However, it is likely that we have set a precedent regarding this third partition and Poland is unlikely to survive for much longer. So we just have to wait long enough for Poland to cease existing via the influence of another outside power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222403.A;Poland is not yet lost. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.T;The Final Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.D;The Russian Army has marched into Warsaw and demanded the complete dissolution of Poland. The shock from the Sejm and the remaining nobility and other members of the ruling class has resulted in nothing less then complete anarchy in Poland as bourgeoisie in Krakow have declared independence in their own right and German troops march into Poznan to secure the rights of Germans in Greater Poland against the Russian menace. Upon this day, Poland has now ceased to exist and has been replaced by the Governorate of Vistula Land which has been made a puppet of $COUNTRY$. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222404.A;Polska jest stracona.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL26.T;The Final Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL26.D;With effective economic and political control over Poland, $COUNTRY$ has demanded the complete dissolution of Poland and the effective destruction of the entire concept of a unified Polish nation-state. Upon this day, Poland has now ceased to exist and has been replaced by a nation known just as "Mazovia" which has been made a puppet of $COUNTRY$. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.T;The Krakow League;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.D;In the complete chaos after the total dissolution of Poland, a league of merchants in the city of Krakow and nearby regions have seized the local institutions of government and refuse to listen to the pathetic orders of the Warsaw Government. They wish for a guarantee of their independence by $COUNTRY$ on the basis that it is only option they have in their current position. $COUNTRY$ could either accept the offer to guarantee their independence or take this opportunity to appoint our own puppet government after a swift invasion into the rogue state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.A;We must take this opportunity before we lose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.B;Just take the offer and pull them into our economic sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.T;The Fate of Swiety Andrzej;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.D;It the aftermath of the collapse of the Commonwealth, $COUNTRY$ has unintentionally been granted the relatively worthless island of Swiety Andrzej in the Caribbean as $COUNTRY$ is by far the most likely occupier due to varied cultural and political reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.A;We must seize control with urgency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL27.T;The New Union of Lublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL27.D;The Commonwealth has declared our autonomy null and void today as they ask for annexation via the signing of a new act of union. We can attempt to fight them but considering their relative strength it might just be better to give in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222406.A;This is the end of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222406.B;The Polish can go to hell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL28.T;Success of the New Union of Lublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL28.D;The Commonwealth has been in continuous decline since its formation in 1569 via the Union of Lublin. However due to a rare moment of clarity in the Sjem and effective leadership, The Commonwealth was able to break though its issues to declare a New Union of Lublin. Let Europe tremble at the Commonwealth reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL29.T;Failure of the New Union of Lublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL29.D;The Commonwealth has been in continuous decline since its formation in 1569 via the Union of Lublin. However due to a rare moment of clarity in the Sjem and effective leadership, The Commonwealth was able to break though its issues to declare a New Union of Lublin. This was not enough to stop the nationalists from successfully defeating the Commonwealth's attempts to annex them though and so the decline of the Commonwealth shall unfortunately continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222408.A;Wait? What!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL30.T;The Commonwealth Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL30.D;Our Non-Lithuanian minorities are not protected by the old Union of Lublin and we have to resort to giving them their autonomy again even after they revolted against us. We will need to create a new Union of Lublin if we ever hope to integrate these minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222409.A;One day, perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL31.T;The Prussian Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL31.D;The Duchy of Prussia had been claimed during the collapse of the Commonwealth by one of the many nations that skirt the Baltic Sea. They claim that we are to be immediately annexed into their nation as a "permanent protectorate" of their interests in the Baltic Sea and if we refuse then they will do so by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222411.A;We have no hope of beating them (Game Over);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222411.B;Prussians never kneel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL32.T;The End of Courland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL32.D;The Curonian Ducal Colonial Trading Company is an institution that has lasted over 250 years and has managed to maintain its own triangle trade and even gain a few colonies around the globe. However, with the abolition of the monarchy and the promotion of Latvian nationalist ideals- there is no longer any reason to continue pretending that Courland as a concept still exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.T;The End of the Poznan Occupation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.D;It had been several years since we occupied Poznan, which is mainly populated by Poles. By creating a regime friendly to us we were able to further weaken the influence of Warsaw, but now there is the question of the future of this regime. We can give it independence by recognizing the government in Poznan as a legitimate Polish government. The radicals among us are calling for the integration of Poznan into our state. After all, we can maintain the status quo, leaving them as our puppets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.A;Create a independent Polish government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.B;The current situation is fine ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

conquest_of_lithuania_RUS_desc;Our diplomats have concocted a most impressive scheme. We will offer Lithuania false friendship in the face of Scandinavian aggressions. The Lithuanians will surely accept our help, and as a result will be made into a client state of $COUNTRY$, to be annexed shortly after, proving that sometimes words are more powerful than cannons. We should expect however, that Scandinavia will not be pleased by such a brilliant move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

kill_lithuania_desc;We have pierced into the heartland of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As of now, we may cut off this archaic entity of the Polish crown and cast it into the ether, ensuring that such an issue will not rise again to challenge our rule in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU1.T;Lithuanian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU1.D;After centuries in union with the Polish crown, Lithuania now faces its own destiny, to be governed by its own whims. This has culminated in a burst of new Lithuanian political thought and political unrest, as the authority that kept the Lithuanian-Litvin conflict at bay has all but disintegrated. The intellectual classes of the Samogitians and the Litvin aristocracy have locked horns, while there’s great uncertainty of how the Lithuanian state will continue, and what ethnicity it should truly represent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU1.A;Three hurrahs for Lithuania?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.T;The Collapse of the Grand Duchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.D;Half a millenia of Lithuanian rule has come to a close. Our lands are now torn apart between Samogitia and the newly formed Litvin kingdom of White Ruthenia, with its own desires of a nation state. Lithuania has not withstood the pressure exerted by its neighbours from all sides, and now it has succumbed to its own people from within. The dying appendage of the Commonwealth has breathed its last breath...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.A;The past withers away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.T;The end of Greater Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.D;The dream of a Lithuanian republic has been snuffed out today... The Samogitians have broken away from Greater Lithuania, and formed a Baltic Samogitian state of their own in hopes of maintaining what they view as the true authentic Lithuanian people. Greater Lithuania lays dead, carved into a rump state as White Ruthenia, while our people succumb to the new reality of their situation. Dreaming of the time Lithuania stood fest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.A;Greater Lithuania no more;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.T;The end of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.D;With a proclamation from our government in newly acquired Vilnius, Lithuania is declared to be abolished! Its former territories are now in our hands and are handled by our governors and officers accordingly. Dissolved, the lands of former Lithuania are now carved out and more easily managed by our state, and the reign of $COUNTRY$ in the Baltics will remain secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.A;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU5.T;Samogitia and White Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU5.D;The coming of the 19th century has not been kind to Lithuanian society in particular. The relations between our Litvins and Lithuanians have been increasingly sour, as the Litvins cemented themselves as the true influence in the Grand Duchy. In addition, our Ruthenian subjects resent the Litvins, viewing them as Ruthenian who are still being treated far better than the rest of them. Now, with the signing of the treaty of Hadiach, we have split Lithuania internally among the litvins and the Lithuanians by creating Samogitia and White Ruthenia as two separate territories, effectively partitioning old Lithuania. This move will surely help to calm down the tensions between our people, who’d take their newly founded autonomy with appreciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#### Danzig Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU6.T;The Annexation of Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU6.D;As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has collapsed, its Baltic possessions are left undefended. Among these possessions stands the City of Danzig, an important Baltic port city in West Prussia, which was under the protection of the Polish crown. But more importantly is Danzig’s position in Prussian politics, as any power that controls it and Royal Prussia may project power unto and dominate the Duchy of Prussia, and as a result will enable us to secure the southern Baltic coast. To our luck, we currently occupy Pommerania, effectively isolating the city from any Polish or German power that might attempt to stop us from annexing the city state. Now with the fall of Poland, we may move to replace its status as the protector of Danzig and secure it and East Prussia for our own benefit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU6.A;Occupy Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

But more importantly is Danzig’s position in Prussian politics, as any power that controls it and Royal Prussia may project power and dominate the Duchy of Prussia, and as a result will enable us to secure the southern Baltic coast. However, we are not the only power interested in Prussia. The Germans in the west have achieved a foothold near Danzig and would be ready to challenge any of our moves against the Danzigers and the Prussians. Dealing with this issue will require some maneuvering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU7.A;Our Baltic ambitions will be realized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.T;Danzig secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.D;We have repulsed Scandinavia’s encroachment on our German kin in Danzig and Prussia! Now with our protection, Danzig’s assembly has confirmed and approved its ascension into $COUNTRY$. In addition to Danzig, Prussia remains open to us, and with Danzig in our hands we may send the Baltic state an offer to join our nation with ease. It’s a glorious day to all Germans east and west of the Weichsel river!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.A;The Baltic coast remains German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU9.T;Danzig secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU9.D;We have sidelined the Germans' attempt to covet Danzig! Scandinavia's position in Danzig and Prussia has been solidified, and our position as the protector of the small Baltic states is indisputable. Now without Polish and German involvement, we may annex the coast and realize our dream of Scandinavian hegemony over the Baltic sea. Of course, Prussia might prove to be more hesitant to annexation than Danzig, but with the Germans out of the picture, we don’t have to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LITPRU11.D;Scandinavia’s imperial ambitions in the Baltic sea have been furthered, as Scandinavia entered the city of Danzig and officially annexed it with the blessing of the city’s assembly. In addition, Scandinavia is now free to further its aggressive actions into Prussia! With this move, Scandinavia has strengthened its position in the Baltic sea and denied our brethren their right to be governed by their own! It’s a sad day for our countrymen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU11.A;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.T;Protecting Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.D;We need subtly if we want to deal with Danzig and Prussia, making outright aggressive moves might draw the ire of the Germans to the west. Some of our officials suggest dispatching a proposal to the city, and offering it our protection as a replacement of Poland’s. Danzig holds no particular loyalty towards the crown of Poland and may agree to our demands. But regardless of our request, it is safe to expect a German reaction to any dialogue between Danzig and our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.A;Send the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.B;We shouldn’t anger our neighbours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.T;Scandinavia offers protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.D;As Poland collapsed, our status in the region has been shaken to its core. We lived for centuries under Polish autonomy as a center of trade and German culture. But now in the chaos of the present, Scandinavia has come bearing an offer of “protection”. Scandinavia proposes to protect and aid the city from foreign threats, stressing our shared heritage in the Baltic sea as the basis. Most of Danzig’s assembly is distraught, as the proposal reeks of territorial ambition and the expansion of its empire as it has done in the rest of the baltic coast. Most in our city express more sympathy towards the Germans in the west, identifying with them as an ethnic kin in comparison to the Nordic Scandinavians, and many wish to petition Germany for protection instead. But some in our assembly are friendly to Scandinavia, expressing optimism about the economy of our city should it be integrated into Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.A;The assembly accepts the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.B;The assembly calls on Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.T;Danzig calls for help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.D;As Poland collapsed, Danzig’s status in the region has been shaken to its core. The city has existed as an autonomy of Poland for centuries and flourished as a center of trade and German culture. But now in the chaos of the present, Scandinavia has begun a campaign of aggressive expansion in the region. Scandinavia proposes to protect and aid Danzig from foreign threats, naturally a blatant excuse to occupy and annex the defenseless city. Danizg is rightfully fearful, and has called on us to protect and defend them from Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.A;and we shall respond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.B;Should we really anger Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.T;The Danzig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.D;To our dismay $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared its intention to defend Danzig against us! Danzig has decided to outright reject our proposal and call on $FROMCOUNTRY$ for help. The Riksdag is furious and our generals call for action against this blatant spit in the face of Scandinavian prestige. We are not sure how committed $FROMCOUNTRY$ is to defending little Danzig from us, but our diplomats suggest ignoring $FROMCOUNTRY$’s announcement and deploying a marine detachment to “protect” the city before $FROMCOUNTRY$ sends its forces to secure it completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.A;We’ll sail on Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.B;This provocation is beneath us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.T;The Danzig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.D;Scandinavia has ignored our declaration of protection, and went so far as deploying a marine detachment to occupy the city! Danzig will not be able to stop the marines from seizing the city, ignoring this threat will surely mean that Danzig, if not the whole of Prussia will fall under Scandinavian control! Our military staff implore us to send our cavalry to the city as quickly as possible to intercept this threat and secure Danzig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.A;We’ll ride to Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.B;This could end badly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.T;The Battle of Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.D;Our biggest fear has come true, our marines were intercepted by cavalry from $FROMCOUNTRY$ in an attempt to stop our advance on the city. Our brave marines have set camp on shore now, and are preparing for a final assault on the city. The situation is tense, as our marines appear to be superior in combat ability, while $FROMCOUNTRY$’s cavalry has the advantage of controlling the battlefield and maneuverability. This could go either way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.A;Storm the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#### Lithuania Startup Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.T;What is a Lithuanian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.D;The identity of what it means to be a Lithuanian has increasingly become contested among our people. Lithuania has been dominated by the Ruthenian Litvins, who have assumed the mantle of Lithuanian identity for themselves, much to the dislike of an emerging Lithuanian middle class who holds themselves as the only true Baltic Lithuanian, and the one whose traditions and language should be represented in Lithuania. Now this battle of words has been carried into the university of Vilnius, where the new Lithuanian movement argues for the representation of the Baltic Lithuanian people against the Litvin and Polish nobility, and the spread of the Lithuanian language in the Grand Duchy’s institutions. This is contrasted by the conservative Litvin nobility, who view themselves as the true representation of Lithuania. The Baltic Lithuanian movement has begun circulating nationalist material, promoting the Lithuanian language and rejecting the Litvin claim of the Grand Duchy. Tensions between the groups are reaching their breaking point in the university...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.A;One Lithuania, two people;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.T;Ban on Lithuanian material;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.D;Following the boom in Baltic Lithuanian literature in the University of Vilnius, the Litvin establishment has begun banning various pieces of Lithuanian literature involving the Lithuanian language and promotion of a new Baltic Lithuanian identity. This action has naturally caused outrage within the Lithuanians in Vilnius, and triggered a series of protests and threats of violence throughout the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.A;One Lithuania, one people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.T;The University of Vilnius bans Lithuanian literature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.D;Unrest has recently surged throughout Vilnius, as middle class Baltic Lithuanians have begun to espouse their will for true Lithuanian representation in the Grand Duchy and the University of Vilnius. This movement was met with opposition from the traditional Ruthenian Litvins, who view themselves as the true and legitimate Lithuanian ideal. As a result, Baltic Lithuanian material in the University has been banned by its Litvin administration as an attempt to curb this movement. However, only time could tell if this move had a desirable effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.A;Surely not worth our attention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.T;The Lithuanian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.D;Unrest in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania grows as the Baltic Lithuanian movement reaches new heights. Liberal intellectuals in Samogitia travel through its cities, establishing unions and clubs to promote what they dub as “The Lithuanian Revival”, in the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe Ruthenian Litvins of Lithuania have slowly grown in numbers and influence throughout the history of Poland-Lithuania, and now they hold a firm grasp on the Grand Duchy and dominate its aristocratic class. Now the two sides clash with each other, each with one uncompromising stance on what a Lithuanian is, unable to recognize each other’s culture and way of life as anything other than deviancy and distortion of their culture. Reconciliation seems impossible, and unfortunately due to our political position, intervention seems even less likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.A;This used to be a whole lot more simple...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#### Partition of Lithuania Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.T;The fate of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is disintegrated, and now Russia has the opportunity to surge westwards against those who have spent the last centuries immiserating our people. We may decide the fate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the declining appendage that only managed to survive this far because of Warsaw.\n\nOur treaty with Scandinavia still stands, and we may curve the little Lithuanian state into pieces, Scandinavia will receive Samogitia, while we receive the rest. This arrangement is definitely valuable, but many in $CAPITAL$ believe that we are in a far stronger position than Scandinavia, and that it would be far more easy to simply snatch Lithuania by forming an alliance with it, forcing it into a status of a client state. We should, however, expect Scandinavia’s wrath should we choose to march on Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.A;We will take the whole of Lithuania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.B;We must adhere to the treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.T;The fate of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is disintegrated, and now Russia has the opportunity to surge westwards against those who have spent the last centuries immiserating our people. We may decide the fate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the declining appendage that only managed to survive this far because of Warsaw.\n\nOur treaty with Scandinavia still stands, and we may curve the little Lithuanian state into pieces, Scandinavia will receive Samogitia, while we receive the rest. This is another step in the advancement of Russia into the status of world power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.A;Let us move on to Lithuania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.T;The end of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.D;The sun sets one final time on Lithuania. From the west, Scandinavia is approaching to fulfil its Baltic dream of domination, and Lithuania is just another piece of that dream. On the east, the ever growing Russian empire is approaching with dreams of expansion in every cardinal direction. The two powers naturally saw each other as friends when dealing with our fledgling state, and have decided to carve Lithuania among themselves: Scandinavia taking Samogitia, and Russia taking the rest.\n\nHowever, not everyone in Lithuania was ready to see their homeland go. The military has seized Vilnius, and began to fortify it, pooling resources from every nook and cranny in a last desperate bid to save Lithuania. We don’t know how the two invaders will react, but we know it couldn’t be too friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.A;Hold... the... line...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.T;The partition of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.D;Now is the time to move on Lithuania, another patch of our imperial ambition. Russia is already prepared to take its end of the deal, now it’s only left for us to take Samogitia and put this ugly product of the Commonwealth to an end. Our marines are ready for the occupation, as we expect it to be nothing short than a short parade across the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.A;A smooth operation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.T;Vilnius defies the partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.D;A surprising turn of events unfolds in Lithuania, as one final piece of the country refused to turn over and die. A group of officers have come together in Vilnius to declare open resistance against our partition. Declaring that the Lithuanian dream will not be snuffed out. We are now in an awkward situation, as both us and our co-partitioner are ready to pounce on Vilnius, a valuable region and city that is definitely worth a little bloodshed over. But only one of us could hope to seize it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.A;Get the cavalry! Take Vilnius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.T;The Russian saviour;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, promising us an alliance against Scandinavain aggression. We naturally know the true nature of this envoy: the end of Lithuanian independence. Flanked on both sides by aggressive powers, we have no way of resisting $FROMCOUNTRY$’s sly plot. Some to our dismay even argue that this outcome is preferable, as otherwise we will surely be devoured by both the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ and the Scandinavian beasts. But regardless of the lesser evil, this is surely a sad day for Lithuania...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.A;We don’t really have choice, do we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.T;Russia seizes Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.D;To our surprise, the Russians have advanced on Lithuania, despite our ambition in the region. The Russian state has brokered a deal with Lithuania, effectively transforming it to a client state and robbing us of any potential gains in the region. Many of our politicians are furious and demand action against the conniving bear while the military is drafting plans of action. On the other hand, many doubt that the cost of war would be worth a little piece of Lithuania. Whatever our approach may be, we are assured that Lithuania can only be taken through war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.A;And war it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.B;War? For Lithuania? Oh, please;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.T;The Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.D;Our government will not let this act of Russian aggression stand. Our forces are preparing to set out to punish Russia for its treachery and retrieve what’s rightfully ours! And This time, we’ll take far more than Samogitia! Our diplomats are ready to hand Russia our formal declaration of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.A;They’ll regret crossing us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.T;Victory in the Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.D;We have crushed Scandinavia feeble attempt to grab what’s ours! The whole of Lithuania is now under Russian control, and our hold over the Baltic is stronger than ever. Now that Scandinavia has been dealt with, there is no need to keep up the illusion of Russian protection over the little Baltic state. Lithuania will be annexed into our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.A;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.T;Victory in the Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.D;We have crushed Russia’s forces, proving that their only way of challenging our might is through treachery. The whole of Lithuania is now under Scandinavian control, and our hold over the Baltic sea is stronger than ever. Scandinavia now stands ascendant in eastern Europe, and any Polish, or Russian attempt to challenge our presence will be dealt with a severe hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.A;Scandinavia’s interests are secured;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.T;Scandinavia backs off;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.D;Upon seizing Lithuania for ourselves, we expected at least some form of Scandinavian resistance. To our surprise, Scandinavia has run with its tails between its legs, leaving us with the whole of Lithuania in our hands. There’s no point in continuing this Lithuanian charade after the threat of Scandinavia has evaporated, we may fully annex this little puppet into our state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.A;A glorious day for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.T;The Lithuanian Scheme;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.D;Our diplomats are ready to contact Lithuania and offer it our protection. With this move, Lithuania will be made into a puppet state. As we are well aware, Lithuania is in no state to refuse our demands. Our top priority now should be to expect Scandinavia’s response rather than Lithuania’s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.A;A glorious day for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.T;The Unification of Ruthenia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.D;With the collapse of the Lithuanian State, our diplomats have been proposing a union with the newly formed state of Belarus for the intended purpose of unifying the Ruthenians against any major threat to the east or west. $COUNTRY$ of course will naturally lead this union so there is no reason not to attempt such a union, at least if it occurs without the denial of Belarus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.A;Let see if this is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.T;The Malorussian-Belarussian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.D;With the collapse of the Lithuanian State, we have been engaged with Malorussian diplomats who have come to us with the proposition of creating a Ruthenian Confederation between both Malorussia and Belarus. There are many in Belarus who see this union as giving too much to the Malorussians and diluting our Litvin heritage but they are a vocal minority compared to the far majority of people who see this union as the only way to protect our people against the Russian or Polish Menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.A;We accept this union between brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.B;We accept this union between brothers (Player Only);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.C;We will never accept a deal with the Malorussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.T;The Unification of Belarus and Malorussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.D;The Belarusian and Malorussian governments have come to a agreement in regards to the creation of a confederation between both Malorussia and Belarus in perpetuity, with the intent to defend the interests of both states against both Russian and Polish aggression. There have also been additional talks in regards to the creation of a greater Ruthenian state that could be created if this union between brothers covered all Ruthenian lands but that may only remain theoretical for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.A;This is the only way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU37.T;Unification Denied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU37.D;The Belarusian government has disagreed with the sentiments of the Malorussian government in regards to the creation of a unified Ruthenian state. The only way that the Ruthenian peoples could be unified now is by the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

MUS09.T;The End of the Golden Age;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS09.D;It is clear by now that Liberal, Socialist and Nationalist agitation throughout the Russian Empire has effectively ended the Russian Golden Age. Reform, is not something that the backwater Russian states have ever been well known for and while liberals ravaged Central Europe in the late 18th century and early 19th century; Russia might as well have been on another plane of existence. However with the formation of a unified Russian state a great deal of western liberals and socialists had made their way over to the rising great power and started agitation throughout the lower classes and military. The Tsar must act now or risk a potentially disastrous rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS10.D;During one of the Tsars many national tours, a man with a improvised explosive rushed his coach and blew it up. Since the suspect had been killed along with the Tsar, there is little or no way to tell whom the individual that assassinated the Tsar was. It is also likely that he was from one of the many groups in Russia seeking to increase their influence by destabilizing the Empire but there is absolutely is no way to be sure. The new tsar, a young man with a rather short temper is expected to make a announcement regarding who should be blamed for this incident...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS11.T;The Russian Coup D'etat;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS11.D;The Russian Empire has effectively ended as a military coup, backed by liberal and socialist intellectuals has taken place. These individuals had watched as the worrying trend of tyranny coming from the Tsar was leading to a inevitable collapse of the empire and had successfully pleaded to the military to take action before it was too late. However, in a ironic twist of fate- the provisional government was unable to prevent several regional governors from declaring independence and the empire had effectively completely collapsed anyway. It is now up to the provisional government to reclaim these territories in the hopes that one day it may be able to gain enough legitimacy to end the temporary dictatorship and create a true democracy in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS12.T;The Future of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS12.D;The Provisional Government has been completely successful in reclaiming the lands that had been lost to the various rogue governors after the military coup. As a direct result of this restoration it has now gained enough legitimacy to have a serious debate about the future of the Russian State and if the Junta should continue, a Democratic Republic be created or the Tsar restored with effectively no power. The ultimate fate of Russia is up to the Provisional Government...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS14.D;With the conclusion of the first partition of the Commonwealth, a proposal has been put forwards regarding granting full Russian Citizenship to all non-polish minorities in the former eastern territories of the Commonwealth. This should strengthen our claim on the territory and prevent further nationalist uprisings in the future that may be to the favour of the Commonwealth. However, this policy is exceptionally radical and many more conservative figures in the Russian Government would prefer if we were to just ignore this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Altai economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Altay and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Dzungar rule in Altai brought chaos, bands of Altay began plundering and burning Mongolian shops. Altay nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Altay governor, Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Altay.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME44101;The Rong Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44101;The Rong Dynasty was a result of a compromise between a Millenarian Figure known as Li Xiuquing, now known as the Qingzu Emperor, and the various warlords and ancient dynasties scattered around the south of China. Li Xiuquing had failed in his ultimate ambition to once again claim the mandate of heaven but had at least completely dislodged the Southern Ming dynasty from the region. The failure only came as the remaining warlords and dynasties formed a coalition to stop the Taiping Rebellion from completely taking over the south of China with the help of the peasants. As the various individuals following the Taiping religion were ultimately limited in numbers and power and the chances of their survival without a widely recognized leader were too small, Li Xiuquing was  recognize to be the new emperor in the region. The name of the dynasty would be inspired by the ambitions of the followers of the Taiping Faith: the Rong Empire, the ever-prospering and the ever-glorious kingdom in Zhongguo. This claim would ultimately be flimsy at best, nonetheless the Rong Dynasty was born.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME44187;The Taiping Anniversary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44187;A hundred and ten years ago upon this day, the Taiping Rebellion had started. This rebellion had completely failed to created a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace as it lacked any considerable leadership but had at least toppled the warlords in the region and forced the Southern Ming to acknowledge that they had no claim over it any more. The empire that had been created from the many compromises and deals made with the Confucian majority would be known as the Rong Dynasty, a dynasty that was forced to acknowledge Confucian teachings but at the same time teachings of the Taiping religion. This anniversary is remarkable because the most important promise made to the Taiping leadership would be that the Rong Dynasty must embark upon a final conquest of China on this date or run the risk of another rebellion. Rong has grown strong in the many years since the rebellion and it seems that they are now intent on a final conquest of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050215;With their armies deafeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight.  We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44168;The Collapse of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44168;We have grown too large without any central unifing figure. Already various warlords have declared themselves independent of our rule once again and our country has collapsed into oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44169;The Great Unifier;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44169;Our warlord state has come across a leader with great potencial in reunifing china. Our troops and officers are already rallying behind him and his rule has become nothing less then absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44170;The Death of the Great Unifier;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44170;Either in the middle of battle or via the means of rebellion against our state, Our Great Leader has been killed. Already there are rumors that the various warlords underneath our rule no longer support us and that they feel as if they should break off from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;xx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44171;The Myth of the Great Unifier;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44171;Some say that we once had a leader that could rule the whole of china one day. This is not a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44172;Our Great Unifier;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44172;Our previous leader had died under unknown means while we had been annexed under another warlord state. We will not be able to use him in the upcoming conflicts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44173;Our Great Leader has some unique ideas about how to reinvent china, however there is heavy opposition from various generals and these reforms may not be allowed to be implemented.

treaty_of_paris_alternative_title;Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_paris_alternative_desc;We have defeated the republican French government and it is time to bring them to the table. We shall demand the immediate imposition of the Valois dynasty and restore the monarchy that had been dissolved upon the collapse of the Dual Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC11.T;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC11.D;This the end. Our government has been dissolved according to this treaty and as a result we effectively no longer exist as a state in any possible or logical way. We should have not left our capital open to attack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC11.A;GAME OVER;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.T;The Two Frances;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.D;There are two republican Frances and they both claim to rule over France. As this situation is silly and this split is not ideological or logical in any possible way, we should consider submitting to the other France and working together to ensure a better France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.A;Submit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.B;They will Submit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.C;THE NORTH IS CHEESE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC10.T;The Occitan Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC10.D;Occitania has betrayed the idea of sister republics and instead seeks to unite France under the Valois dynasty. As the vanguard of republicanism in western Europe upon the death of the Dual Monarchy, we are forced to take a stand and counter their absurd claims followed by placing their territory under our domain rather then theirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65110.A;French Democracy shall reign supreme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC1.T;The Direction of Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC1.D;With the creation of a new Occitan State for the practically the first time in history. We have been granted a opportunity to choose the direction of our nation. Shall we claim France in the name of the Occitan or shall we create a new Occitan state in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65100.A;;For France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65100.B;;For Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC2.T;The Final Stage of the Hundred Year War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC2.D;To claim the mantle of France would be to first remove the Valois from the face of the Earth. However in doing so, we risk the Valois doing the same to us and a few are already doubting our choice in reclaiming France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65101.A;;Down with the Valois;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65101.B;;You know. A new latin empire sounds good about now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC3.T;Becoming Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC3.D;Occitania does not have a strong enough claim on France itself. To show the north that we are legitimate about destroying their authority, we must become Provence and crown a king which is related to the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65102.A;A united France under our rule is a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC4.T;The Occitania-Catalonia Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC4.D;A circumstance has been reached where it is possible for both Occitania and Catalonia to unite in perpetuity. The Government of Occitania has already sent a letter to the government of Catalonia regarding immediate unification as per written in the constitution of Occitania and is expecting a positive response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65103.A;We shall greet our new brothers in arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC5.T;Occitania has asked for immediate unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC5.D;Ever since Occitania was granted its independence. It has come to believe that it was the unifier of all non-Spanish, non-French eastern Latin cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65104.A;;Agree - GAME OVER;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65104.B;;Go to Hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC6.T;The Unification of Catalonia and Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC6.D;Catalonia has agreed to a formal unification under the pretext of liberty and democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65105.A;Unification has been achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC7.T;The War of Yellow and Red;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC7.D;The Government of Catalonia has returned in complete disagreement and has already taken measures to mobilize their army as the inevitable war looms. We must fight for our right to unite our cultural group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65106.A;They have signed the death warrant of thousands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC8.T;Portugese Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC8.D;With our conquest of Iberia complete, we have found ourselves unable to correctly administrate all the land that we have conquered. As such our most remote piece of iberian territory, Portugal has erupted into major unrest and has effectively declared itself outside of our prestigious rule. With further unrest throughout the other conquered territories we must come to a compromise that will benefit all our new subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65107.A;If we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC9.T;The Portugal Compromise ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC9.D;After weeks of deliberation and discussion, it has been concluded that the only valid course of action to appease our iberian citizens is to create a independent portuguese state. With such a small loss of land we will be among the most stable empires in Europe and may even be able to consider ourselves on the same level as some of the larger empires in Europe. However, it is still a loss of land and many inside Occitania disagree that we should even give any land away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65108.A;The Compromise will be accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65108.B;The Compromise will not be accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

aragonmustdie_title;Claim Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
aragonmustdie_desc;The Kings of Aragon have no claim to a territory which has always been ruled locally by the Catalan peoples. We shall fight for their liberation from their oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

theoccitanempire_desc;We have furthered the cause of the Occitan people beyond even that of the glory days of Aquitaine. It is time to ensure our place in history and create a empire that shall stretch from the Alps to the Algarve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
theportugalcompromise_title;The Portugal Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
theportugalcompromise_desc;Our glorious conquest would not be without opposition. Many in Iberia would ultimately come to consider our government illegitimate to the point where it is impossible to effectively rule our territories. So, we must craft a compromise to ensure our dominance in this region for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_LRR_title;Natural Borders of France;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_LRR_desc;There is a doctrine going around our government that the borders of France should rightfully connect to the Rhine River. However, the far majority in our government consider such a proposition foolish and it is unlikely that such ideas could prosper under a democratic government. If that were to change and the means to spread these ideals became further advanced then it is entirely possible that the borders of France shall one day reach the Rhine River.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
##### Hungarian Stuff to Do #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_serbia_title;Vassalize Serbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_serbia_desc;The Crown of Tomislav never held the area of Serbia but it was always a major concern in the eyes of the Croatian and Hungarian Kings. We must secure the territory by turning Serbia into a subject before it can become a threat to our national sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_romania_title;Claim Romania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_romania_desc;Transylvania holds notable Romanian Minorities continues to act as a serious concern for Hungarian Government. A proposal was put on the table to simply remove the threat of Romanian Nationalism before it can become a concern to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_montenegro_title;Claim Montenegro;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_montenegro_desc;The small state of Montenegro sits between both Croatia and Serbia. We must claim this state if we have any serious ideas regarding the domination of the Balkans due to its exceptionally important strategic position and its partially Bosinak population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
### The Great Northern Brothers War ####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
unionster_dominance;Unionster Dominance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
unionster_dominance_desc;The Unionster Party has effectively ruled as the only party in Scandinavia since the conclusion of the Great German War. No other political party is able to even get the slightest momentum and the political establishment would prefer it to stay that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCA_political_chaos;The Galskab;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCA_political_chaos_desc;The Unionster Party has completely collapsed after the Finnish Crisis and the Vinlandic Revolution. This has left a political vacuum in Scandinavia that will likely take years to fill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL1.T;The Scandinavian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL1.D;The Scandinavian Empire, or Kalmar Union, one of the great powers of europe, holds land and influence from Scotland, to Great Novgorod, to northern Germany. Following the conclusion of the Great German War, Scandinavia, although acquiring great gains in land, sits in an uneasy position, stemming from unrest and rising nationalism, and discontent with the Unionster Party, with the Old Guard currently holding Scandinavian politics with a tight leash. A great storm is brewing in Scandinavia, and whether the Empire manages to weather it or not remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL1.A;Til Skandinaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL2.T;The Three Kingdoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL2.D;"The Three Kingdoms" has been published, and it has been a complete success among the ruling conservative party. This fiery piece of literature talks about the heartland of Scandinavia and Scandinavian Culture, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. In doing so, it excludes the already marginalized Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL2.A;A new bible for the conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL3.T;The Tree Crowns Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL3.D;On the year of our Lord $YEAR$, an important piece of legislation has been passed. Being hailed as the most important reform of its time, atleast by the ruling party. The Three Crowns Act, as it is come to being known, demarcates and redefines the internal borders of the Scandinavian Empire, heavily inspired by The Three Kingdoms. This controversial act completely detached Finland, Germany, Scotland and the Baltics from what is being called the Scandinavian Heartland. This is sure to be quite a controversial act with our subjects, given the lack of representation and marginalization already present in our "non-scandinavian" constituents..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL3.A;This is Scandinavia, after all!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4.T;The Collapse of the Unionster Party ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4.D;With blunder after blunder, ending with the Finnish disaster, the Unionster Party is no longer seen fit to rule the empire, and faces total collapse. With many of its politicians and important figures flocking to other parties, the once long-ruling and all-powerful party is on its last legs. What this will mean for the political scene of Scandinavia is yet to be seen, but this could surely open the path for new political movements within our empire, for better or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4.A;Serves them right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4A.T;The Collapse of the Unionster Party ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4A.D;With blunder after blunder, ending with total economic collapse, the Unionster Party is no longer seen fit to rule the empire, and faces total collapse. With many of its politicians and important figures flocking to other parties, the once long-ruling and all-powerful party is on its last legs. What this will mean for the political scene of Scandinavia is yet to be seen, but this could surely open the path for new political movements within our empire, for better or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4A.A;Serves them right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.T;The Scandinavian Federal Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.D;A new movement has appeared across central Scandinavia, the Scandinavian Federal Movement. They call for an end to the Unitary status quo, which is ancient in nature and doesn't recognize its constituent kingdoms. Their ultimate goal is the abolishment of the Unitary system, in change for a Federalist system with equal representation for the different peoples of Scandinavia. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.A;Fringe, at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.T;The Scandinavian Federal Movement Grows;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.D;The once-fringe movement is fringe no more. With the constant and continued failures of the Empire in both internal and external matters, the mainstream Federalist movement has converged into one cohesive party, the Federal Union Party, even if its popularty is negligible at best, the combined efforts of the myriad of smaller Federalist movements have taken effect, giving rise to a noticeable divide between the three main crowns of the Empire, those of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.A;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.T;The Demand for Federalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.D;The Federal Union, swelling with new members every day and a fringe movement no more, has been petitioning our government both by protest and by letter to finally implement Federalism in Scandinavia once and for all. Which in their opinion will solve the regional divides within our empire and heal our people, who every day drift further away. We could pay heed to the Federal Union, but at what cost? Some of our ruling officials have voiced concerns that giving autonomy to our "less important" states will just drive them towards eventual independence from Scandinavia as a whole, with such a thing being unacceptable. What decision will the government make?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.A;Nonsense! We will not bend to the Federalists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.B;Attempt Federalist Reformation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL8.T;Federalism in Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL8.D;With the Federal Union holding the government in a stranglehold, plans are being drafted regarding the federalisation of the Empire. This follows major unrest and empire-wide protests, stemming from the Three Crowns Act. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL8.A;A Federalist Empire? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL9.T;Reports from the Scandinavian Federal Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL9.D;The Federal Union, during its inception as a fringe movement and now as an established political force within the empire, has seen radical splinter groups emerge from itself, one of these groups in particular advocates for the complete independence of the feudal kingdoms inhabiting the periphery of the Scandinavian Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL9.A;Separatism will not be tolerated!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL10.T;Mass Defection in the Federal Union Party ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL10.D;There are preoccupying reports coming from the inside of the Federal Union Party, with the majority of its constituents flocking to the newly established Swedish Realm Party, leaving the once popular and influential Federal Union Party a rump version of its former self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL10.A;Troubling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.T;The Rise of the Swedish Realm Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.D;Thanks to the poor decisions of the Government, and the struggle between Federalism and Unitarism, a new Reactionary menace has emerged. The Swedish Realm Party, born from a schism within the reactionary Nordic Realm Party, is rising rapidly in the Scandinvian political sphere. They advocate for a national renewal of the Scandinavian Empire, distancing itself from the passive and conceding nobles in Christiania, and instead opting for a Swedish-Led Scandiavian Empire, with its capital in Stockholm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.A;They will never amount to anything! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.T;A Swedish Realm Party Victory...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.D;After their rise, from a fringe splinter group of the Federal Union, and their subsequent swelling and support coming in from disgruntled Swedish and Scandinavian Nationalists, the Swedish Realm Party is projected to win Regional Elections. This is troubling fact, given that the government already holds a tenuous grasp on the various constituents of the Empire, and surely a Scandinavian renewal under absolutist Swedish rule will not quell the dissenters any further. While some circles call for fraud, or outright banning the party, some marginal groups call for national renewal, which they espouse as the salvation that Scandinavia needs to survive. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.A;Ban the Swedish Realm Party! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.B;Democracy is Democracy, after all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.C;Rig the Elections! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL13.T;Faltering Democracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL13.D;Following our unconstitutional and illegal rigging of the elections, everything is crashing down. What were the government officials expecting to happen, for the Swedish Realm Party to completely ignore such outrageous actions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL13.A;How did this happen? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL14.T;The Stockholm Putsch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL14.D;The Swedish Realm Party, with support of the Royal Army and reactionary circles within Scandinavia, have taken over the government apparatus in Stockholm. These news come as no surprise, giving the incredible blunder carried forward by the Scandinavian government in their attempt to rig the elections in their favor. With this, the SRP effectly wrested control of Swedish from the Empire's hold, the fate of Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole hangs in balance, with the revival of long-dead titles and national renewal movements, the future does not seem bright for the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL15.D;"...In the Interest of the Swedish People and their State, the party has decided to detach itself from the rotting, corrupt and immobile carcass of Scandinavia, opting for a future for the Swedish People." These were the words heard in the Stockholm Riksdagshuset, As Sweden cut its ties with Scandinavia as a whole. Following Scandinavia's corrupt actions against the democratic apparatus, the SRP took their opportunity. They renounce their claims, opting instead for a national rebirth of the Swedish people as an independent polity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL15.A;För rätten och folket!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL16.T;The Sundering of the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL16.D;With their revolutionary fervor in full swing, the now-independent Sweden had attempted a follow-up coup in Christiania, in order to free the Norwegians from the Scandinavian Yoke. However, this did not go according to plan, following a Federal Union Counter-Coup taking place mere hours after the SRP stormed the Slottet. The Federal Union, however, in a surprising move, has declared the Kalmar Union as void, knowing that Scandinavia as a unified entity is past the point of no return, with this, Norway becomes independent under the radical Federalis regime. Nobody knows what will become of the former great northern empire, but the future doesn't look bright. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL16.A;Dark Clouds loom over Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL17.T;The Great Northern Brother's War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL17.D;Following decades of strife, failure, mismanagement and fraud, all-out war has broken out between the Three Crowns of the former Kalmar Union. In a last ditch effort to reign in their former subjects, the head of the Kalmar Union, Denmark, still clinging to their imperial titles, have begun a reclamation campaign against the Norwegian and Swedish breakaway states, while in the meantime the Swedes viciously look towards the Fjords... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL17.A;The Future of the North, on a tightrope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL18.T;Scandinavia Marches On!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL18.D;With the Stockholm Putsch and the Christiania Counter-Coup, nobody really thought that Scandinavia would be whole again. However, the Imperial Faction in Denmark has done the impossible and dragged the corpse of Scandinavia back from its cold grave. Scandinavia survives, but at what costs? It will take an extreme amount of effort to reconcile the Scandinavian peoples once again, and to not fall into the same pitfalls that they once did...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL18.A;A time for mending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL19.T;Swedish Victory in the Northern Brother's War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL19.D;Having beaten back the Danish Imperialists and the Norwegian Radical Federalists, the Swedish Realm Part stands proud over its brothers-turned-enemies, zealously protecting their newfound independence, and fighting with a zeal that hadn't been seen since ages past. Sweden leaves Scandinavia in the past, because for now, the Swedes are free to fulfill their future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL19.A;Democracy dies in the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL20.T;Freedom in the Fjords;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL20.D;With the failed Swedish invasion of Norway following the Stockholm Putsch and subsequent Northern Brother's War, Norway has managed to maintain its newfound independence throughout the conflict, besting the Swedish and managing to stave off the Scandinavian desire to restore order over the Norwegian Crown. Without one of its constituents, it is unclear how Scandinavia will continue to function as an entity, but for now, Norway is free, once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL20.A;Alt for Norge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL21.T;The End of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL21.D;Following catastrophe and humilliation in the Northern War, the Danish Imperial forces have completely pulled from the front, signing peace with their former brother kingdoms. With officials and different representatives storming in and out of the the parliament, plans are being drafted and borders are being redrawn, as Scandinavia comes to an end, the former crowns of Finland, Scotland Karelia, and the various Baltic and North German holdings are free again. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL21.A;Did it really have to end this way...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191913;Imperial Alliance has Collapsed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191913;The glorious alliance between Burgundy and Scandinavia has finally collapsed today after the beginning of what is now known as the Parliamentary Crisis. This alliance was first created to fight German revolutionaries and then expanded to fight Bohemian expansion but the collapse of Burgundy into what seems to be a state of civil strife has made it completely impossible to maintain. As a result we have nothing protecting us from Bohemian expansion into Pommerania and it is extremely likely that if Bohemia declared war at this point we would lose badly. We must find alternative alliances as soon as possible or risk the complete destruction of the Baltic Mare Nostrum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191913;We must create new alliances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191914;End of the Burgundian Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191914;Our alliance with the Kingdom of Burgundy has officially ended today as Burgundian diplomats have stated that it is nearly impossible for them to come to our defence due to the ongoing civil strife in the nation. External sources have stated that the King of Burgundy has been acting very erratic lately and seems to be making decisions that have undoubtedly sent the nation on the path to a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

accept_the_scottish_desc;The Scottish Rebellion has destroyed whatever good will the Scottish had with Scandinavia.

HAGGIS01.T;The Scottish Aristocratic Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS01.D;Scandinavia has held Scotland ever since the Stewart Dynasty had risen to the throne of a recently unified Scandinavia, but it had never truly tamed the country. Scotland was always the country of the Scottish and each and everyone one of them would quite clearly claim that the current situation regarding their territory being a part of Scandinavia was only a temporary fact, rather then a permanent one. The most notable of these "rebellious" types are the aristocratic families of Scotland who have despised Scandinavia since the day that Scotland had joined it. Today, a society of aristocrats have met in Glasgow to formulate a plan to ensure Scottish independence in the near future and they are already considering bringing it up with the regional government in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS01.A;The Scottish are always causing trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.T;The Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.D;The Scottish Regional Government disobeying direct orders from Copenhagen has decided to hear out the Aristocratic Society. A petition date has already been organized and the Scandinavian Government is already waiting for the results of these futile arguments regarding how the Scandinavian Government has failed in their duty to protect the Scottish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.A;A joke. Nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.T;The Scottish Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.D;The Scottish Aristocratic Society has been agitating for a independent Scotland for hundreds of years and today they finally make their move. They have appeared in front of a special session of the Scottish Government to justify their claims that Scandinavian Government is no longer able to protect the Scottish people and that Scotland should declare independence. Indeed, if Scandinavia has failed in their role as the protector of the north then it is likely that their claims will hold true. However, if Scandinavia has maintained stability and the British islands are still under the domain of a French-aligned Anglois empire then it is likely that this petition will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.A;They better understand that treason is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.T;Scandinavian Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.D;The Society has presented the argument that since Scandinavia is no longer considered a great power of Europe. That it does not have the ability to protect the Scottish people against the legitimate great powers of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.A;A regrettable situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.T;Stewarts Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.D;A good reason why Scotland has not detached from Scandinavia on a earlier basis is because they had a sense of national pride regarding the Stewart Dynasty. Since they are now effectively being ruled by Scandinavians and not the Scottish, the Aristocratic Society has already gathered members of the Stewart Dynasty to resume their rule over Scotland if independence occurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.A;The Republic is the only way forwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.T;Failed Protectors - Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.D;Among the list of various failures that the Scandinavian Government has "achieved" was the loss of North Germany. Indeed, how could they protect Scotland from whomever controls England if they cannot protect Germany?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.A;Add that to the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.T;Failed Protectors - Livonia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.D;Livonia had been controlled by Scandinavia since the days of yore and yet now it has failed to hold on to it? Unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.A;That's quite enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.T;The Dictatorship;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.D;The $MONARCHTITLE$ is not born of the Stewarts and yet he controls tyrannical powers far beyond what the Stewarts had ever achieved. The Regional Government feels threatened just by even holding this petition and is likely to listen to whatever false words come out of this "Conspiracy" and agree with them on everything. They have already committed treason by doing so, might as well just get the rebellion over and done with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.A;The Secret Police have failed this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS09.T;England Prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS09.D;England exists, and so does its efforts to destabilise Scandinavia in the British isles. A great deal of individuals in the room are already considering to vote for autonomy or independence just by this simple fact alone and the best possible result is highly unlikely in these circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS09.A;Perfidious Albion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS10.T;Young Scotland Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS10.D;Walter Scott Jr of the Young Scotland Movement has already started his English-funded insurrection throughout Scotland. Most of the room has been either threatened or bribed to vote for independence upon the conclusion of this petition and it is unlikely that any other opinion shall prevail. War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS10.A;Curse the English.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS11.T;The Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS11.D;The Dual Monarchy has spent a great deal of effort trying to integrate its English subjects and has found great success in doing so. The Scottish regional government has sent envoys south of the border to see if the Dual Monarchy wants to involve itself in this situation. After all, the more the Dual Monarchy is focused on its English Subjects: the more likely it will intervene!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS11.A;Go back to France, Anglois!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS12.T;Support Scotland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS12.D;We have been sent envoys from Scotland whom are asking for our support in liberating themselves from Scandinavian Rule. As we have endeavoured for balanced rule between both the French and English and have been successful in doing so, we could support the Scottish with the caveat that its unlikely that we will be able to push further influence onto them beyond that of just simple support in this rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS12.A;Support the Scottish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS12.B;Deny them Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS13.T;Support Scotland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS13.D;We have been sent envoys from Scotland whom are asking for our support in liberating themselves from Scandinavian Rule. As we have focused on appeasing our English subjects and have been utterly successful in doing so, we could support the Scottish with the idea that we may be able to puppet or even annex them ourselves in the aftermath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS13.A;Support the Scottish with all our resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS13.B;Haggis is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS14.T;The Scottish Petition - Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS14.D;The Aristocratic Society has been utterly unable to present a case that would de-legitimise our rule in Scotland. This very society that had claimed that we had failed to protect the Scottish would not last for more then a week after the petition failed as its leadership was arrested for treason against the Scandinavian nation when they attempted (and failed) to coup the very government that had denied them their claims. Furthermore, this event has further legitimised our claim over the Celtic and Northern Parts of the British Islands and we should be able to claim such lands if the right circumstances were to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS14.A;Scotland is Scandinavian. Now and forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS15.T;The Scottish Petition - Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS15.D;The Aristocratic Society has been able to successfully present a case that our rule in Scotland is illegitimate. However, the Scottish Government has disagreed with the claim that Scotland must completely break its ties with Scandinavia and rather that it should seek Home Rule. Does the Scandinavian Government agree with this sentiment or should the Scottish people continue to kneel to Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS15.A;Allow Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS15.B;Caledonia delenda est;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS16.T;The Dominion of Scotland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS16.D;The Dominion of Scotland has been created with plan set out by the Edinburgh Government and is permitted only enough autonomy to prevent total independence. The Dominion of Scotland is not permitted to establish external foreign relations and is only permitted to seek trade deals with the approval of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS16.A;Freedom!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS17.T;The Scottish Petition - REBELLION;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS17.D;The Aristocratic Society has been able to successfully present a case that our rule in Scotland is illegitimate to the degree where Edinburgh is preparing to declare independence. No alternative solutions were permitted in this petition. War is inevitable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS17.A;That's not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAGGIS18.B;Is it too much to hope for a diplomatic solution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS19.T;The Scottish Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS19.D;The Scottish Aristocratic Society has successfully petitioned the Scottish Government to unilaterally declare independence from Scotland. $COUNTRY$ is furious and has already declared that they will do anything in their power to put down this rebellion. Many are saying they would be correct in their assertion that the Scottish could stand no chance on their own, but there is a chance that the present government in England has backed this rebellion and Scandinavia could easily find itself in a fight it cannot win. The fate of Scotland is decided here. Freedom or Slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS19.A;All hell has broken loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
##### Hispanic Commonwealth #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,b
restore_quito_title;Reclaim Quito;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
restore_quito_desc;Quito had broken off during the Colombian War. We should reclaim it to ensure that the Viceroyalty of Granada can be completely restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_form_commonwealth_title;Create the Hispanic Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_form_commonwealth_desc;The Colombian Wars were a series of bloodbaths that had lasted over twenty one years. Through what now seems like a complete miracle- Spain had prevailed and restored order over Colombia. However- there are already whispers of a potential second set of independence wars and unless we were to reorganize our territory in a way that treat the Colombian people as equals to our Iberian population, it is unlikely that we will be able to hold on to this territory any further then the turn of the next century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_upper_granada_title;Partition the Granadan Viceroyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_upper_granada_desc;The Viceroyality of Granada has remained by far the most loyal of the four Viceroyalities of Colombia. However, contained inside this Viceroyalty is a region that is known to be completely disloyal to the Hispanic crown and would rather tie themselves to the Incan Empire or outright revolt for independence: Quito. Therefore it should be the immediate imperative of the Hispanic crown to therefore abolish the Viceroyalty of Granada, annex the loyalist regions in the north and establish a new Viceroyalty of Quito which should maintain our interests in the area without catastrophic instability issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VGS_title;Tame the Central American Warlords;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VGS_desc;The Viceroyalty of Greater Salvador has continued to fail to maintain control over the countless warlords hidden in the jungles of the region. Thus, with advancements in Naval Doctrine and Statecraft it has now become possible to abolish the Viceroyalty and deal with the warlords directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VMEX_title;Destroy the Legacy of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VMEX_desc;The Viceroyalty of Mexico was not a creation of the Hispanic crown. It is a abomination that effectively obliterated the concept of New Spain and replaced it with a entire cultural identity that had diverged even further from Spain then regions like Granada or Central America. New schools of Economic and Political thought have enabled us to craft a "valid" claim that the unique identity of the Mexican culture is barely apparent or even non-existent compared to Central Spanish and with these claims we should be easily able achieve full acceptance of this culture inside of a few months and the annexation of the Viceroyalty alongside it- ending the legacy of Gran Colombia once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VLST_title;End the Other Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VLST_desc;The Viceroyalty of Lusitania might as well be ruling over a completely foreign culture in comparison to the rest of Colombia because Lusitania has continued to be the bastion of so-called "Pure Portuguese" speakers who refuse to even try to align their language with the rest of Colombia. As the world continues to get smaller due to continued technological advance in naval construction and ideologies such as "Pan-Hispanism" reach their inevitable climax- we cannot tolerate this sort of behaviour any further and must strive to align their culture with the mainlander Portuguese rather then the wild divergence that they presently are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VQUI_title;The Final Obstacle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VQUI_desc;The Viceroyalty of Quito was set up after the partition of Granada. It was created due to a general inability to maintain control over that region due to mostly being populated by Native Amerigans and mountainous terrain that heavily limited infrastructure projects. With the turn of a new century, annexation and integration of the north and completion of infrastructure projects such as the Andagoya Canal- there is no further need to maintain the the final obstacle to our supremacy over Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW22.T;The Congress of Havana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW22.D;The King of Spain, his cabinet and the countless viceroys, governors and landholders that make up the ruling class of the various Colombian Viceroyalties have met in Havana to discuss the creation of a unified Hispanic Commonwealth. Spain, being in a undeniably advantageous position at this Congress was able to make them agree with the creation of such a union but it was a impossibility to make the Viceroys and the ruling class of these Viceroyalities agree with everything. Concessions would still have to be made and these include the inability for the Commonwealth to integrate Catalonia at any point, the capital would be moved to Lisbon and guarantees that the Viceroyalities would maintain complete autonomy for the time being ( with the exception of the Captaincy-General of Cuba and the isthmus of Andagoya). Will the King of Spain agree with these concessions or abandon the idea of a unified Hispanic Commonwealth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW22.A;¡El nuevo mundo te espera!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW22.B;The King prefers a unified Iberia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW23.T;The Collapse of the Hispanic Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW23.D;With the independence of Spain from the Hispanic Commonwealth- the Colombian remnants have effectively collapsed into a series of Hispanic and native warlord states. Many of the emergent warlords have claimed the legacy of both the Commonwealth and the former Colombian Alliance, seeking to unify Colombia under their banner. However, no state has either the army or the industry of the old Commonwealth or Alliance to achieve rapid success, making unification seem unlikely and far-flung.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW23.A;Thus all good things must come to a end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.T;The Colombian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.D;With Hispania's decline on the international stage- there has been a troubling build-up of unrest in the Colombian lands. This has resulted in the creation of several political groups that demand for either immediate liberalization or independence from the Empire. This unrest has finally come to a head, as both independence and liberalization groups finally deciding to reconcile and ally with the sole intention of either forcing the liberalization of the Hispanic Empire or ensuring its immediate dissolution. The ultimatum has already been sent to the King and they now await a response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.A;We are forced to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.B;The King shall not have his power decreased to irrelevance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.T;The Hispanic Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.D;The Hispanic Commonwealth has suffered from countless setbacks, to the point where a power which could have once been called one of the greatest in the world has declined to a point of near irrelevance on the world stage. There are already rumours of a plot to separate Colombia from Spain in the desperate hope that without the dead-weight that is Spain then Colombia could rise to greatness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.A;Everything is fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.T;The Second Congress of Havana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.D;Various important political figures from all Colombian states had met in Havana to consider the creation of a new "Colombian Alliance" to deliberately fight back against Iberian influence in Colombia. This council had lasted for no more then a week before they had all unanimously agreed on the creation of such a alliance, and they had even agreed on the second proposal of creating a federal union between all these states. It seems that the creation of a Hispanic Commonwealth had the unintended effect of unifying regions that previously had been deliberately in-fighting between each other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.A;That's treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.T;The Second Colombian Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.D;The second most important question put forwards at the Second Congress of Havana was what type of government this new "unified Colombia" would have. This would take the form of a federal democratic republic as imagined by Herrera, Vincente and the other glorious figures of the First Colombian Independence War, as any other alternatives would be unacceptable in the current political climate. With the inauguration of the first President of the Federal Republic of Colombia- a demand would be sent regarding the immediate withdrawal of Spain from Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.A;Why resurrect the legacy of Herrera?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.T;The Illegal Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.D;The second most important question put forwards at the Second Congress of Havana was what type of government this new "unified Colombia" would have. This would have been a republic if not for the attendance of Pedro, Duke of Coimbra whom had spoken up regarding his affinity towards the plight of the Colombian people, and the legitimacy that could be gained if Colombia had a Emperor. The congress agreed and Pedro was therefore crowned Pedro I, Emperor of the Colombian Empire and protector of the Colombian people. His first proclamation with the support of the congress would be to immediately declare independence from Spain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.A;Disavow that maniac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.T;The Second Colombian Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.D;The dream of $COUNTRY$ would be born at the Congress of Havana after Spain's successful suppression of the First Colombian Independence War and it would continue to reign supreme as the hegemon of the New World for many years. However, $COUNTRY$ has failed to maintain this prestigious position and has undergone a rapid decline that would ultimately result in a Second Congress of Havana- a congress that would resurrect the legacy of the original Colombian Alliance and declare independence for all Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.A;Thus we return to madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW32.T;La Nación Dividida;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW32.D;Spain has known war for decades in 1836. Following the coup of 1808 and the proclamation of a Constitutional Monarchy under the usurper Jose II, Pedro IV rallied his supporters during the Brothers’ War that saw the Peninsula ravaged by war as Liberals battled the Legitimists helped by the Dual-Monarchy. Jose II was eventually vanquished in 1815, sent in exile abroad while Pedro IV regained his throne. Portugal who had been the main base of support of the Liberals, still entertains the legacy of Jose II, with more Liberal plotters in Lisbon and Oporto than in the rest of the country, with many still angered at the relocation of the capital away from Lisbon to Madrid. Nevertheless, the Colombian War has managed to reunite all the Peninsulares against the end of colonial order in the New-World. But after that, who knows what will happen to Spain ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW32.A;One King, one nation !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW33.T;Death of Jose de Aviz-Lorraine ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW33.D;Our ambassador in Roma has informed us of the death of the former usurper Jose. Brought to power by a seditious assembly in 1808, he and his partisans were eventually vanquished by the rightful King Pedro IV in 1815 with the help of the Dual-Monarchy. Jose was allowed by his brother to settle with a small court in Roma, far from his country.

SPACW34.D;The news of the death of the rightful King of Spain in exile, Jose II has come to the New-World, with a day of mourning declared by the Republic. A reformer brought to power against his brother by the Porto Junta of 1808, Jose’s reign had been cut by the Dual-Monarchy who supported the reactionary Pedro IV. After his defeat, many in the colonies rebelled against the return of Pedro and Absolutism. An embassy sent by Herrera had proposed him the Crown of Gran Colombia but the King refused, having relinquished any claims with his defeat. " ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW01.T;The Two Capitals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW01.D;Ever since the creation of Spain in the 16th Century, there has been a constant debate regarding which capital the Kingdom should be ruled from. For a short period at the beginning of the 19th Century, the capital was moved to Lisbon for the very first time under the initiative of Jose "the Reformer". However, his successor Pedro IV would opt to move the capital back to Madrid as the Viceroyalities started to collapse into rebellion. Now as the fires of rebellion have finally died down in Colombia either though our ultimate victory or defeat, Alfonso XV has finally decided to put a end to this debate and choose the true capital of Spain once and for all. The institutions of Spain shall be forever be tied to this permanent capital and it shall be never moved again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW01.A;Stay in Madrid ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW02.T;The Spanish Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW02.D;$COUNTRY$ has suffered endless setbacks in foreign policy, economic decision making and military mobilization. The result is that Spain, once one of the greatest nations in the world: has been completely crippled. Countless citizens have taken to the streets to protest our persevered weakness and there are already talks of succession or revolution by independence movements or military cliques. It is only a matter of time before a match is struck and $COUNTRY$ burns to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW02.A;This is only a temporary crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.T;The Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.D;The crisis has hit a new level today as the King has dissolved parliament and taken effective control over the entire apparatus of state with the justification being of emergency circumstances. However, this did not go down well with the population of $COUNTRY$ who have seen fit to permanently cut off communication with the central government and leave the situation in a stand off between the government and these various movements. The fire is beginning to burn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.A;The King is always right;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.T;The Federal Review;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.D;The Lisbon-ruled Spanish Federation has found itself confused by various reports that state that various city governments in Castille are simply refusing to pay tax with the reason that the federation does not have any right to rule over Castille as the union of crowns that permitted such a aberration has been deposed. A review board has been created and a census is under way to find out exactly causing grief with these local governments beyond that of simple monarchist ties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.A;The monarchy is dead. They need to get over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.T;The Review Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.D;The Spanish Federation is unable to formulate any policy that could solve these innate issues with the population because as it turns out a clique of military officers have already taken the initiative and have seized Madrid. They are now claiming to be the legitimate government of Spain but have taken no moves to ignite a civil war in the hopes that we will stand down and let them take over the country. This is a stand off. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.A;This is madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.T;Military Movements in Madrid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.D;One of our most esteemed Generals, one "General Zavala" has seen fit to relocate a large portion of veterans of the Guardia Real to Madrid. Zavala has continued to claim that our republican revolution was a Portuguese conspiracy and that they always felt that the monarchy should be abolished and the capital moved to Lisbon after the betrayal of Alfonso XV in his choice to keep the capital in Madrid. It is likely that he is of very little threat to us because if he attempts to coup the government, the citizens will just counter him with force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.A;A minor threat. Easily resolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW06.T;Zavala's Coup d'etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW06.D;What the government of Spain was somewhat expecting has finally occurred: General Zavala has assumed the apparatus of government in Madrid today by force of arms. The parliament has been dissolved and Zavala is already claiming that the Portuguese traitors shall be dealt with and anyone supporting the ideas of democracy will be suppressed. Naturally, in Portugal and Galicia this has been taken as a insult but the greatest threat lies in the monarchist circles in Castille whom were expecting a immediate restoration after the coup but were denied as Zavala would prefer to remain president-for-life. For a moment, Spain is quiet. However, this stand off cannot last forever. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW08.D;Ever since the end of the Colonial Wars, a rift has been growing in Spain between Lisbon and Madrid after Alfonso XV had decided to place the capital of Spain in Lisbon. Today, the tensions have boiled over as Madrid has been occupied by a military junta that states that it intends to restore stability to Spain and the legitimate government in Lisbon has responded with a declaration of war which has immediately torn the country to pieces.

SPACW10.D;The nightmare that everyone had expected has finally occurred. A individual claiming to be a member of the long lost original House of Aviz has persuaded a good portion of Castille to break off and declare independence with the expectation of creating a democratic Kingdom of Castille. Only in the chaos of a civil war could have anyone expected such a situation to occur but the seeds were planted back when the capital had been chosen and a good portion of the Castillian population had decided that independence would be preferable to being ruled by Portugal. This threat must be defeated or it will be the death of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW11.T;Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW11.D;Ever since the end of the Colonial Wars, a rift has been growing in Spain between Lisbon and Madrid after Alfonso XV had decided to keep the capital of Spain in Madrid. Today, the tensions have boiled over as the Government of Madrid has declared war on all forces that intend to destabilize Spain. The result? A reborn Kingdom of Castille has been created by what is said to be a member of the long lost original House of Aviz that intends to restore democracy to a independent Castille. Whomever survives this war will dictate the fate of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW15.D;We have defeated the Junta and ensured that they will rule no longer over Spain. However, the Kingdom of Castille has declared that they will not reunite with us and reform Spain and rather maintain their separation from us. We could respond to this by either tolerating their existence and ceding all territory we own that is rightfully theirs back to them or alternatively declaring them and the Galician traitors as illegitimate successions from the legitimate government of Spain and conquer them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DUA70.T;The Counter-Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DUA70.D;With the Anglois Question now out into the open and slowly tearing the country to pieces, Henri X has deemed it necessary that the Estates-General must be dissolved at once to ensure future stablity of the state. There are many questions to why he would do such a thing but it is likely that though his experiences of the German Revolution and various other events in recent years, he has come to believe that democracy in any regard is a destabilizing force and no state can survive without it being regulated or even abolished. However, many in the Dual Monarchy (especially in England) feel that his experiences should rather reaffirm the Estates-General and not be cause to dismantle it. Regardless of the outcome it is likely that his event shall affect the coming importance of the Anglois Question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DUA71.T;The Paris Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA71.D;Dissolving the Estates-General was going to have consequences and so Paris is in complete revolt. The King of the Dual-Monarchy has been presented with two possible ways to resolve this situation, he can either give in and restore the Estates-General to what is was before the Counter-Revolution or alternatively he can use the few remaining military assets scattered outside of Paris to attack and destroy the revolt. However due to the saturation of this revolt and the fact that these military assets are mostly left over artillery from the German Revolution, it is likely that this will be considered a not very prestigious act and ultimately one of sheer desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA172.D;Countless Dead. Liberals, Reactionaries, Conservatives and Nationalists Alike. The order given to fire the artillery at Paris had catastrophic consequences as a few shells landed in the occupied Paris Arsenal and destroyed a large chunk of the city in a catastrophic explosion. Already the nationalists and liberals are claiming martyrs and whatever chances we had of resolving the Anglois Question without major revolts is effectively dead. It is already expected that we will have very dangerous nationalist and liberal activity in the near future and it may even result in the collapse of this nation to these revolts. We must prepare ourselves. The tide is coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All other languages will be banned and the Anglois language will become the only legal language in the Western Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA175.T;The Great Gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA175.D;As the tide of liberal revolution burns throughout Europe, it has rendered the Dual Monarchy in an extremely unstable position and the Anglois Question is likely to be the doom of us unless we promptly crack down heavily on one of the groups that are leading this revolt against the Anglois Nation. Two potential options have been presented to the Estates-General regarding resolving the current crisis, one that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Anglican English and another that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Protestant Occitan. Whomever we target is likely to be secured without much of a issue but the other group is likely to react against this decision to such a degree that our ability to control the region will be sacrificed, for now. Of course we could refuse to enact either option and sacrifice nothing but the Anglois question will continue to destabilize our nation and make the general integration of our non-Anglois population an extremely difficult endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

A group known as the Sons of Saint Louis have declared what is now called "The Third Aquitaine Revolt" as they illegally seize a large portion of Occitania to "protect themselves from the Anglois menace who seek to destroy their culture". Unfortunately for them, this revolt has little or no international recognition and it is unlikely that it will seen as anything more then a minor police action by the great powers of Europe.

They say that this was a result of the former policies of the Dual Monarchy that had deliberately targeted and oppressed the English Population and left the Occitan regions feeling as if they would be the next to have their cultures effectively destroyed and forcefully integrated into the Anglois Culture. This had left the regions in a state of effective anarchy with minimal control being felt from Paris and many independence groups popping up that would deliberately target any attempts for the Anglois Culture to spread to these regions.

DUA180.T;A Federal Government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA180.D;In a shocking turn of events, the schooling reforms that were proposed by the Estates-General were not just rejected but practically thrown out by every single level of the government. Instead, a new piece of legislation is being passed around that outright rejects any attempt to destroy any cultural group in $COUNTRY$ and rather reform the entire entity into a federal state which moves away from the concept of Anglois domination and enacts heavy rules and regulations to outright prevent any form of assimilation and guarantee the rights of every single cultural group in the $COUNTRY$. The absolute majority of the government is ready to pass this legislation but there is still a exceptionally small minority that is willing to support the schooling reforms, the head of state could easily intervene to support their position with the point that attempting to create such a state entirely goes against the point of the $COUNTRY$. What will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA181.T;The Dangers of a Federal Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA181.D;$COUNTRY$ may have enacted the bill that has formed the Federal Government, but many are still wary at the idea of federalism. They fear that if the Dual Monarchy were to decline to a lesser position on the world stage (GP6 or below), or have its capital occupied. Then the very protections which ensured the rights of the various cultural groups could backfire and result in the complete collapse of the Dual Monarchy. Be vigilant, be aware.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA182.T;The English Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA182.D;$COUNTRY$ had taken the risky step to implement a system of cultural autonomy that may have given too many rights to its varied cultural groups. This system would have proven sufficient so long as the Dual Monarchy maintained its status as the one of the greatest powers on the planet, however continued failures by the government of $COUNTRY$ has resulted in a situation where this system has backfired and the "State of England" has declared unilateral independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA183.T;The Federal Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA183.D;$COUNTRY$ has entered a state of total collapse as the system that had protected it against cultural unrest has utterly backfired upon the moment that a group was refused independence.

DUA184.T;English Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA184.D;The Anglois had ended the 19th Century with the English made an oppressed people with the intent to destroy their language, culture and religion through effectively enforcing the education system to only teach Anglois language, culture and Catholicism.

anglois_education_system_desc;For hundred's of years, the Dual Monarchy has lacked a singular, centralized curriculum that has led to each university simply providing their own, leading to a varied, dysfunctional state of low efficiency. Jean-Pascal Toutain, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University of 1752-1760, had attempted to bring order to this chaotic system, as well as open up new avenues for education in England, using his wealth to fund and endow voluntary schools across England. Gathering his peers to establish a singular curriculum. His arguments espousing from towards greater efficiency, an professional & educated workforce, as well as maintaining linguistic control of the curriculum to give French it's primary position in the English Curriculum. Although Toutain failed at his objectives, we can remember his attempts, and can finally implement his ideas into a unified education system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the system that is being implemented by the Education Minister is that of the abolition of local dialects in schools and to teach the Anglois curriculum universally. There have already been strong debates in the Estates-General regarding this decision as many are calling it "verifiable insanity" and many arguments regarding the fact that the Anglois state should move away from a system of cultural oppression as dictated by the Plantagenets and into either a Federal System or alternatively just have referendums to see what regions wish to stay with the Anglois State.;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUAR4.D;With the revolution settling down, the shackles of feudalism no longer tie down the constituents of the old Dual Monarchy. With no titles, no king, and multiple national identities inhabiting the United Republic, the revolutionary government is in talks regarding these aforementioned constituents. While some representatives call for referendums regarding their state in the United Republic, others call for federalization to be put forward.

Lines are being drawn, soldiers are being conscripted, and municipal halls stand empty.

So did the ability for it to continue to rule over Afghanistan and rather a minor tribal leader outside of Kabul would be named its King instead of the Afsharids. This king would go on to perform the impossible task of liberating a good portion of the Sikhs from the rule of the Mughal Empire but ultimately fail to perform any further conquest due to a entire generation being effectively killed in the bloodbath required to achieve such a feat. Two more kings have past and now with information from the west signalling the end of the Ottoman Civil War and either its collapse or decline, it is time to finally begin our duty of conquering the west by starting with the nation where our Kingdom had been established from: The Afsharid Dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

333525.T;The Vinlandic Evacuation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.D;We have lost all our disputed territories to the Belgian Confederacy and have been rendered utterly irrelevant in Arcadia. However, We still have one card left in our desk and it involves the fact that unlike Plantagenia, we are of a culture that is utterly unrelated to the Confederacy and can sacrifice our ability to form an Arcadian Union on the alter of maintaining our independence. A simple proclamation that we prioritise the Vinlandic identity and it should render it effectively impossible for the the Belgian Confederacy to conquer us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.A;The Arcadian Banner shall not fly over our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.B;We shall strive towards a Arcaidan Union still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333526.T;Vinland denies the Arcadian Dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333526.D;Vinland has proclaimed that is no longer has any intent to peruse the Arcadian dream and has proclaimed its full independence from anyone attempting to do so. Unfortunately, we must acknowledge this claim under international law and until such time that our government has no intent on following international law: they will not be joining any potential Arcadian union. We could hand them back their historical cultural land in return for them permanently revoking their claims over Septiman territory as well, or we could just permit them to keep their claims and give them nothing. .;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

333527.D;The Confederacy is offering all territories of Vinlandic Culture in return for a permanent revocation of all claims we have over Septiman Territory.

HND001.T;The Mughal Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND001.D;The Mughal Empire was once the sole ruler of the Subcontinent, but the reactionary policies of Emperor Aurangzeb had put an end to this golden age, starting a long era of decline. In the late 18th and early 19th Century, the far majority of princes decided to break off from Delhi with the backing of European powers. Beroda sided with the Scandinavians, the Marathas went with Spain, while Nagpur and Hyderabad went with Burgundy. As various smaller princedoms also managed to break off, the Durrani were able to seize Punjab while the Nazim of Bengal declared its independence. In 1820, the disintegration of the Empire was temporarily halted by the deposition of the inept emperor by the reformist Prince of Delhi. Will the Mughal Empire reverse its decline or will the machinations of its often disloyal army and nobility put a definitive end to the dynasty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND001.A;It feels as if the Empire has only twenty years of life left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.T;Sharia Law and the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.D;Emperor Aurangzeb has implemented full Sharia law during his reign, and after the period of imperial collapse in the 18th and Early 19th Century it has been thoroughly proven that this is likely one of the main reasons why the empire had entered a state of terminal decline in the first place. However, outright repealing Sharia Law is likely to piss off the far majority of Islamic nobles in the empire and may even lead to a military coup if the Empire is unable to suppress their efforts. Is it better to appease the Hindu Princes or appease the Islamic Nobles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.A;We must repeal it for the sake of the empire (Concessions are possible);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.B;We must not repeal it for the sake of the empire (Concessions are not possible);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND003.T;The Bundelkhand Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND003.D;The land of Bundelkhand is also well known as a land of traitors as back in the 17th and early 18th Century there was a revolt there by a Indian prince known as Chhatrasal. Though the efforts of one of our greatest generals he was defeated and the land has not revolted since, but it may revolt again if the Empire is unable to give autonomy and protections to the rulers in the region before the inevitable war with Bengal occurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND003.A;We must give concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND003.B;These concessions are too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND004.T;The Gwalior Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND004.D;The Nizaim of Gwalior has been considering independence ever since the entire southern portion of the Mughal Empire had completely broken off. However, if we give further concessions and promise total religious and economic autonomy then it may be enough to prevent their inevitable rebellion when the war with Bengal occurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND004.A;We must give concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND004.B;These concessions are too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.T;The Inevitable Invasion of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.D;Without a doubt, the Nazims of Bengal declaring their independence as the Sultanate of Bengal during the early 19th Century was by far the most embarrassing and destructive moment in the history of the Mughal Empire. The Empire has been avoiding a confrontation with the east for many years because of the potentially destabilizing effect it could have on its Hindu subjects but now it seems that the situation has changed. Several military commanders have broken ranks and decided to directly invade Bengal without any orders from the Emperor and Bengal has responded with a deceleration of war against the Mughal Empire. All overtures of peace have failed and at this point it seems that total war is inevitable and utterly unavoidable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.T;Bengal has fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.D;At some point in the past decade, Bengal had fallen into the hands of a foreign power. Already our inability to regain the rogue province has created a catastrophic destabilizing effect in our empire and with our nobility out for blood and blaming the Hindu Princes for our failure it is likely that the situation will dissolve into a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.T;The Mughals have returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.D;The Mughal Empire has declared that they would finally regain their lost territory from us. The idea of neutrality that the Sultan has been perusing no longer suits us any more, it is time for us to re-militarise and put all our effort into fighting this extreme threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.A;We were preparing for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.T;Signs of Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.D;There has been signs of dissent between the Hindu Princes as many have denounced the autonomous actions from our military as a sign that Delhi is completely unable to keep any element of the Empire under control any-more. The Durbar has responded with the counter-argument that these generals were rogue and that the government had attempted peace with the Bengal Sultanate before it declared war itself. This counter-argument is left unanswered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.A;This was not our fault. I swear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.T;Complete Chaos in the Mughal Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.D;As we had expected, it seems that a state of total chaos has erupted throughout the Mughal Empire as various minority groups attack each other relentlessly. The Hindus fight the Muslims and the various Nazims and Princes throughout our empire are already considering declaring independence from our rapidly collapsing empire. It seems that we are in a very dire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.A;WHY IS EVERYONE SO ANGRY ABOUT BENGAL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.T;The Mughal Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.D;The Mughal Empire has been in various states of the decline for the past century and a half but the greatest loss was that of the critically important lands of Bengal. Any attempt to regain Bengal would have had serious consequences and when a completely autonomous and illegal invasion of Bengal by rogue Mughal generals occurred, nationalist and religious tensions would cause the country to completely collapse into a bloodbath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.A;I hope the Europeans are not watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.T;The Mughals have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.D;The Mughals have permitted us to have our independence and they shall not return to our territory (for now).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.A;We win. They lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.T;The Sultanate of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.D;The Sultanate of Bengal was created when the Nazims of Bengal declared independence during the catastrophic decline of the Mughal Empire. Bengal would prosper for a time after that but soon run into tensions when both Muslim and Hindu groups started relentlessly attacking each other over what they both considered their rightful territory, the Sultan would put a stop to this by doing the unthinkable: political neutrality. If the Sultan of Bengal would promise not to attempt to conquer more Hindu subjects then the Islamic population would never find themselves outnumbered, the Islamic subjects of Bengal were appeased with this and the Hindu subjects would tolerate it. However the fact that Bengal cannot peruse military conquest for now is crippling. It seems that it would take a crisis of some form to break this unfortunate situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND08.T;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND08.D;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the civil war in the Mughal Empire. The outcome of this conference has become known as the 'The Hindustan Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', officially abolishing any previous treaties regarding this region and formalizing the exploitation and annexation of Indian nations. After this point, any aggressive action in India will be justified which includes annexation though spheres of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND09.T;Imperialism Comes to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND09.D;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND10.T;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND10.D;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND11.T;Nationals Expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND11.D;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND13.T;The Question of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND13.D;Bengal is a territory in the north-east of Hindustan that has always remained exceptionally valuable to any nation that has held it. Unfortunately, Bengal is now considering itself a self-standing independent nation and that is wasting valuable resources that could be used in the hands of Europeans. We should request their immediate annexation and invade them if they refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND30.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ demands our Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND30.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared that we are to be immediately annexed into their empire under the threat of war. However, the Sultan has another plan. He had attended the conference that had created the "Confederate Institution for Indian Civilization" and even if he had ultimately refused the offer that had been presented there with the idea that Bengal has no need for a "Confederation". He would still enact a similar plan to the southern princes and give concessions to the Europeans (such as Southern Bengal), before using the peace created by these concessions to successfully westernise Bengal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND31.T;The Sultan's Counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND31.D;The Sultan of Bengal has presented us with a set of concessions and immediate submission under the terms of the Hindustan Act. We are obliged to agree, lest we annoy every Great Power on the planet as refusal has diplomatic implications regarding our blatant ignorance of the Hindustan Act that could be catastrophic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND14.T;Trade Company Manipulation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND14.D;Ever since the conclusion of the Hindustan Conference, the western corporations and businesses in $COUNTRY$ have done all they can to take over every layer of our government. As we had taken the path of opening up to western nations we have very little or no choice in the matter of being able to avoid their influence. Soon we may even lose our independence to the very nations that once told us that it was our goal to westernise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND17.D;A prince from Maharashtra has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. He will also permit any coastal concessions that we demand and he will give us access to the full economy of his wealthy lands. The creation of this princely state is likely to be far more profitable then just taking the lands that we need as we will have full cooperation of its leadership, rather then another highly hostile colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND18.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has permitted one of our northern princes to kneel to $FROMCOUNTRY$ at the same time as demanding various territorial concessions, before any of our relatively outdated military assets had a chance to stop him from doing so. The territory had already been garrisoned by $FROMCOUNTRY$ and since have very little chance in fighting modern European military assets, we must relent or give them a excuse to entirely integrate us into their growing empire regardless of our present westernisation progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND21.D;A prince from Gwalior has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. However, unlike other concessions this one is unlikely to give us anything apart from a vassal which will of course be useful in blocking other European nations from expanding beyond the centre of India but economically worthless. Should we give this prince the autonomy he needs, or will we just continue our intent to annex his nation. Remember, if we refuse this offer he may take this to another nation and they will put this territory under their control rather then us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

All that's left to do now is send the colonial fleet and this territory shall be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO4.T;The Europeans have arrived;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO4.D;There has already been word of a colonial fleet arriving on the westernmost part of the continent which contains thousands of Europeans that are clearly ready to take over the whole continent- just as they did what is now known as Arcadia. They have already declared that this continent be named "Terra Australis" and not Zuharra! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO5.T;The Last Bastion of Humanity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO5.D;There is one remaining place that eludes Europa, and that is the island that is to the east of Zhourao that is without a name to speak of. The various Burgundian and Dutch traders from Indonesia have called it: "New Zealand" but have not taken any effort to colonize the island due to fears of the natives that occupy it. As the main continent has been effectively occupied by another colonial power in the west, this remains the sole remaining place in this part of the world that we should be able to colonize. Shall we do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO6.T;The Death of Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO6.D;We have been given a ultimatum from the colonial overlord of Terra Australis that it is time for the nation of Zhourao to cease existing and that total occupation from Terra Australis must occur. We may have a technological advantage here, but it is unlikely that we will be able to beat the combined armies of the colonial empire. Should we fight as honour demands us to do so, or surrender in the hopes that Zhourao will rise another day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

INDO1.T;The Second Khmer Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.D;Udaraja III has reigned for ten years in the Khmer Empire and yet he only sees a tiny Kingdom in place of what was once a great empire! Alas, the failures of the glorious Khmer Empire during the 18th Century had resulted in a catastrophic period of troubles that lasted for twenty seven years between 1749 and 1776 and had tore the second empire to pieces. With the empire effectively crippled and in a state that has not been seen since the bleak days of the Khemer Dark Ages (after the Collapse of the First Empire). One would think that it was unable to rise again. However rumours are spreading that the King of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.A;For Angkor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.T;The Kingdom of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.D;The Kingdom of Champa has maintained its independence from both Dai Vet and the Second Khmer Empire for over eighty years now, but the dynasty of Champa is currently weak. As it turns out, the current king of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease with no known cure and the only heir is two years old. Already vultures are circling the throne and waiting for his inevitable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.A;The nation is doomed! (GAME OVER IS LIKELY);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.T;The Collapse of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.D;The King of Champa has been suffering from a terrible illness for months and today he has finally passed away. The only heir was a two year old whom displeased the military enough to result in them immediately declaring the abolition of the monarchy with the insane excuse that Asia needed to move into a age of modernity away from monarchies, even as they seize power themselves and proclaim a dictatorship. This intolerable fact has resulted in the region of Champa breaking away and joining the Empire of Dai Nam and the rest being left as prey to a Khmer Empire that is expecting its restoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INDO4.A;That was easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.T;The Death of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.D;Uaraja III has declared that the Republic of Champa shall be dissolved and annexed into the Khmer Empire directly. All young men must join up in this mission to scare away European ideas and "liberalism" from Asia! Indeed, this should be the first step in the restoration of the Second Khmer Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.A;Hurrah!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.T;Missionaries in Cochinchina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.D;The collapse of Champa was likely to have consequences. The most obvious was that of it being considered prime territory for European missionaries seeking to convert individuals to their belief systems. The greatest concentration of these missionaries are in the ports of Cochinchina and it is likely that there could be major issues in the future if any European power takes direct interest in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO6.A;Hopefully nobody notices..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.T;A strange request from Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.D;Some of our missionaries in Cochinchina have had enough of the persecution of their missions and have requested that we directly intervene. They have asked us to request the local government in the Cochinchina region to seek protectorate status away from whatever indochinese empire is oppressing them. It is likely that we should be able to easily acquire that territory without any need for a colonial war in the region, but there is a chance that the empire owning that territory will not be pleased and start a war anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO8.T;Cochinchina Seized by $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.D;The local government in Cochinchina has requested protectorate status from $FROMCOUNTRY$ and has been officially granted it. As a result the entire region has broken off from our empire and $FROMCOUNTRY$ states that if we take any effort to recover the territory then we will have to fight them for it. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European country, this war may be considered suicidal by nature and it is likely that if we attempted to fight them then we would lose. However, losing territory and not doing anything about it is considered extremely non-prestigious and will harm our empire in more ways then just territorial loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.A;We will attempt to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.B;Let them have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.T;The Return to Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.D;The Hindustan Conference had only demonstrated that India needed civilization to effectively resemble modernity. However, to the east of India is the region of Indochina which has been known to be far more bloody and self-destructive then India in even its worst periods of history. $COUNTRY$ should attempt to provide Indochina with the same level of civilization as afforded to the Indians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.A;Onto Civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ wants Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded that we cede the Region of Champa to them on the basis that we have no right to occupy a territory that was rightfully part of the Kingdom of Champa. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European nation, attempting to refuse would result in a deadly war that we would be unlikely to win. However allowing further territory in Indochina to be taken by a European nation would be a exceptionally bad idea if one wanted to maintain independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.A;We cannot fight them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.B;Not one more province. Fight them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
INDO11.T;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO11.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to us demanding that we sign their so called: "Treaty to maintain stability and civilized society in Indochina". This treaty effectively partitions our nation and allows $FROMCOUNTRY$ full control over our economy and foreign policy. Signing this treaty would be a death sentence. Fighting back would also likely be a death sentence. Die or die gloriously, these are our only choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However, this treaty is extremely unequal and is designed to partition and weaken Indochina to the point where it would be easily possible for the complete subjugation of the region to European interests. Unfortunately Dai Nam has been forced to sign this unequal treaty, either though capitulation on the matter or having it enforced after a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Gabor I was not a ambitious man and never had any children or close relatives to speak of, the Duchy of Nitria after all was not a prestigious title. This has caused succession issues that will have to be solved with a Regency Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

HUN17.T;Springtime in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN17.D;The Hungarian regency council has been unable to select a replacement king after the death of Gabor I and have practically resorted to bickering between each other for little or no reason. The liberal revolutions that have spread throughout Europe have taken a interest in this predicament and have promptly declared the Kingdom of Hungary effectively dead as they have committed to a coup d'etat that has taken out both the regency council and the entire "reactionary" government with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265417.A;For the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.T;A Alternative Option;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.D;Rather then search for a hard-to-find survivor of a long-dead Hungarian dynasty or risk further falling into Bohemian influence by crowning a member of the Jagellion Dynasty, we could crown the Duke of Austria as the King of Hungary and create a union between us and them. Its a controversial option and has a lot of opposition but the potential of effectively taking over German territory via a personal union is extremely tempting. Of course, we could just crown a member of the Jagellions or continue searching for a Hungarian heir but this is a option that would guarantee a quick heir rather then being forced to wait for the regency council to come up with a valid Hungarian heir or fall into the Bohemian Sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN19.D;A envoy from the Kingdom of Hungary has unexpectedly offered the crown of Hungary to the Duke of Austria. This would effectively mean that as he is both the ruler of Hungary and Austria, we would form a union between both countries. The Hapsburg Dynasty has been looking for a greater title then that of the elective monarchy of the Commonwealth or the Duchy of Austria and the chance has finally arrived. A chance for the Dynasty to finally advance beyond its mediocre station as the Duke of Austria and into greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN21.T;The Creation of Transleithania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN21.D;The succession crisis that has plagued Hungary since the death of Gabor I has finally come to a end in a way that nobody could have ever hoped to expect beforehand: The Duke of Austria has been crowned in $CAPITAL$ as both the King of Hungary and the Duke of Austria, creating a union between both Hungary and Austria and effectively merging the two nations into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265421.A;A proud moment for Hungary and the Hapsburg Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.T;News from Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.D;Hungary has been consulting with the Duke of Austria with the intent to form a "Union" between both nations. As Austria is a member state of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hungarians still own the Duchy of Nitria, it is our duty to respond in a manner which suits the prestige of our title as the Emperor and prime imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.A;Allow them. This could weaken the Revolutionaries in the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.B;The Duke of Austria must use the title: "King in Hungary".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.C;Hungary must relinquish the Duchy of Nitria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.D;Denied. Force them to relinquish Nitria if they ignore us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.T;Interjection from Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must use the title: "King in Hungary" and kneel before the Holy Roman Emperor at his palace in Prague. This would be extremely humiliating internationally and it is likely that we may even be thrown out of the world stage if we did so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.A;Kneel and take the title of "King in Hungary";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.B;Go to hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN24.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must give up the Duchy of Nitria if we wish to continue down this path. This was to be expected as Bohemia has been wanting that title returned to them ever since the Hungarian Revolution ended in the Duke of Nitria (who was a vassal of Bohemia) being crowned as the King of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.A;Return Nitria to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN27.T;The Issue of Transleithania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN27.D;Either though revolution or congress we have formed the Danubian Confederation. However we have been unable to fully unite all Danubian territories under our banner due to the existence of the Kingdom of Transleithania, a blight on Europe. Many within Austria agree with the sentiment that Transleithania was a mistake and are ready to take up arms against their government with our direct support. However, doing so risks retaliation by Transleithania and since it is likely that other states in Europe are already preparing to go to war with us: adding Transleithania to this mess could be very dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.A;Tell them that it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.B;Tell them that it is time to unite with their German brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.T;The Austrian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.D;Vienna has fallen to a large group of Danubian nationalists intending to unify Austria with the newly formed Danubian Confederation. Unfortunately, before a counter-attack was possible many other cities and towns also fell which lead to our immediate withdrawal from Austria Proper. These events are likely the result of direct support by the Danubian Confederation to destroy our nation for the sake of German nationalism. If Transleithania does not act decisively and declare war on these rogue Austrians, it is likely that the Kingdom of Transleithania will collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.A;Declare War. NOW.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.B;Give Up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.T;The Hungarian Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.D;The Hungarian Regency Council had been created to choose a new king for the Kingdom of Hungary and it is clear that they had attempted to impose a Jagellion onto us. However, the fact that the Regency Council had attempted to crown a Jagellion was not lost on the military and there would not even be an announcement before the military marched right into the palace and wrested control of the government from the council. The Hungarian military does not tolerate fools who attempt to pull Hungary further into the sphere of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265430.A;The Junta will protect us from the Bohemian Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.T;Danubian Confederation Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.D;As we have been unable to recover Austria from the Danubian Confederation, it is practically inevitable that the collapse of this union will occur. Already there are many individuals questioning the continuation of this union in $CAPITAL$ and the government has already stated that it will be voting on the future of the union in the coming days. It is likely that they will vote Transleithania out of existence since there is nobody left from Austria to continue support of this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering such a union could alarm the powers of Europe to a great degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31531;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
