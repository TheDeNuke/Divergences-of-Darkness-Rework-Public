lessons_of_the_german_revolution;Lessons from the German Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century, representing the culmination of liberal thought which had built up across Europe in the preceding century. This Revolution - often simply referred to by Europeans as "the Revolution" - was utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership. Furthermore, its practical aim (German unification) was appropriated by the Holy Roman Emperor, who sought to pursue such a goal without alterations to the social order. Thus liberalism and absolutism still contend on the battlefield of ideas on equal terms, with neither concept seen as supreme - and unless a second Revolution shakes a world power, liberalism may never reach its full potential.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_second_failure;The Second Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_second_failure_desc;As the dust from the liberal revolutions of the 1840s settles and the liberal utopia that many had expected in Europe had not arisen, the movement has begun to split into both Commercialist and Radicalist ideologies. Commercialists see the failures of liberalism as an overriding attachment to social and political issues while failing to understand the role of economics in shaping, rather than being shaped by, society. They uphold freedom of commerce as a good in and of itself, and maintain a strong ethos of individualism. Radicalists in contrast see liberalism's failure as a consequence of abandoning the Dahlkist commitment to total social equality, equity, and justice. Therefore they pursue both peaceful and armed struggle towards a free, united, democratic, and secular society. These splits have dealt severe harm to the unity of the liberal cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ordre_nouveau;The New Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ordre_nouveau_desc;The Burgundian crisis of the mid-19th century and its aftermath echoed across Europe and the world. The clash of the Royalists and the Parliamentarians sharped political debates around monarchism, the rights of the people, and the nature of the 'state' in both legal and philosophical terms. In the wake of the crisis, some saw it as evidence that monarchy must inevitably give way to democracy, lest it become mere tyranny. Others instead saw proof that monarchism, properly supported by a broad political movement, was quite capable of survival even in the modern era. The violence which played out during the crisis also informed future military tactics about warfare conducted in urban and semi-urban environments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_phoenix_arisen;The Phoenix Arisen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_phoenix_arisen_desc;The fervor of radical ideologies coming to the fore in Germany has opened the floodgates of worldwide political upheaval. With both the far left and the far right taking on wild new shapes, the old "liberal-conservative" axis of the post-Dahlke era is seen as an anachronism. The new century brings with it hitherto unseen paradigms of social organization and activity, fueled either by utopian dreams of the future or desires to revive the distant past in the context of the present. Most striking of all is the embrace of revolutionary rhetoric by both extreme ends of the political spectrum, shattering one of the greatest iron laws of European-inspired politics : the right wing's abhorrence of the Revolution and its loyalty to the Altes Regimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
a_new_tomorrow;A New Tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;
a_new_tomorrow_desc;A Great Empire has risen somewhere in the world, built by the efforts of its people to rule the world as we know it. This nation, unlike all those which have preceeded it, is without obvious peer or equal. Not simply through sheer territorial size but in all-pervading economic presence has this Empire become the arbiter of world affairs. Now is the age of humanity's first true superpower, whose legacy - especially in terms of culture and language - will shape the rest of the world long after its future decline and fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
gotterdamerung;Gotterdamerung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gotterdamerung_desc;The German Order is completely shattered and changed in ways that are unreconizable. The Holy Roman Empire's principle of Ewiger Landfriede (Eternal Public Peace), intended to prevent internal wars between Imperial Estates, collapsed during the escalating strife and chaos of the 1840s. This opened the door to radical shifts in the German political landscape, as German nationalism, thought banished after the end of the Great German War in 1820, returned with a terrible vengeance. This, combined with the devastation of the Hollowing, has upended the political balance of central Europe. More impotantly, liberalism and absolutism have once again faced each other on the German battlefield, and their confrontation will echo far beyond the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_rise_of_paternalism;The Rise of Paternalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_rise_of_paternalism_desc;In the wake of the Great German War, European conservatism found itself struggling to escape its ties to the Altes Regime - to the world of crown, church, and country, to high-handed aristocracy. This was compounded by Cornelius Blanqui's publication of The Communist Manifesto, in which Blanqui argued that the class interests of European society were inherently opposed and called upon the working class to overthrow its oppressors. Facing the desertion of the lower classes towards liberalism and socialism, conservatism was forced to reconcile itself with modern methods of mass organizing.  Paternalism thus arose as an answer to the attacks of liberalism and socialism - a way to appropriate socialist policies of welfare and liberal notions of broad political involvement, and orient them towards the support and protection of the elites. Yet just as the "old money" of the aristocracy leaned on Paternalism to redirect the energy of the masses, they found themselves forced to make common cause with the "new money" of the bourgeoisie - who increasingly became the senior partner of such conservative alliances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA666.D;Despite the efforts of the French and English to end the Dual Monarchy, $CAPITAL$ has restored its control through sheer military determination. It seems clear that Paris’s idea of trying to promote the Anglois idea peacefully was a fool’s errand and that the only thing that matters is the use of force. If that is what the people want then that is what they shall get and any threat to the Anglois idea shall be purged. Those who say “Vive la France” shall perish and those who fight only for England's green and pleasant land will burn. All those who work against $CAPITAL$ shall be punished no stone shall be left unturned, and the rot shall not fester.

With the use of the armed forces the Estates-General has been dissolved and a new government has been formed called the Gouvernement de Salut National or Government of National Salvation. This government answers only to the ruler of the Dual-Monarchy and they have one mandate, to ensure Anglois supremacy in the country. To this end they have been given a blank cheque to do whatever is necessary to bring forth a new cultural revolution and create a god-fearing people who are loyal to the fatherland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DODFFP7.T;A Rebirth of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP7.D;As $COUNTRY$ slowly descents into riots and chaos over the recent election results, the now-ruling Fascist Party of our nation has begun to instate a number of executive orders to crack down on the menace of the streets of our cities with unprecedented brutality. One sizeable portion of the royal court of His Majesty is increasingly growing anxious over these new developments, fearing that they might bring ruin to our nation. Another vocal portion advocates for a continuation of a symbiotic relationship between the fascists and the  $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, to bring back the past glory and stability of our historic past. As the uncertainty in the population is evolving towards frustration and anger, the king has decided to address his subjects regarding the fascist party and the future of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

DODFFP7.B;The king asked them politely, yet firmly, to step down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP8.T;The Establishment of the Popular Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP8.D;With the general turmoil of the recent years subsiding in favor of an uneasy peace and with fall of the old order of things, our young socialist republic has emerged from the ashes after a clique of various left-wing political organization managed to come to an agreement regarding the new administration of our country. While peace in our time seems possible, the facade of the republic is already being questioned by the two wings of the provisional government: a moderate faction wants to return to a more libertarian approach towards the state structure, limiting the reach of the socialist vanguard which ought to be legitimized in regular elections. The Radicals, however, believe that the socialist republic is the wrong measure and are already discrediting it as a bourgeoise deception. The soul of the young people's republic has yet to be determined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP8.A;... So raise the scarlet standard high!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP9.T;The Vanguard intervenes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DODFFP9.D;Parliamentary and presidential elections - one of the first tests for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist republic - were postponed after the results were less than favourable for the ruling socialist conglomerate of wildly different left-wing political organizations. These news gave the incentive for the radical vanguard of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist hardliners to de-legitimize the victories of parties outside the ruling socialist bloc, postponing the elections until the "the socialist republic is secured from within". Whatever the true intentions were, and despite the anger this move has caused in moderate circles, the socialist party has reemerged as victor from the elections, although not in a democratic fashion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DODFFP9.A;We will not fall back under bourgeois control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DODFFP10.A;It gives the hope of peace that lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP10.T;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Elections postponed once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP10.D;In a rather unsettling turn of events, the ruling bloc of socialist organizations came to the conclusions to not recognize the recent election results after a narrow vote within the bloc to do so in the face of growing popularity of more reactionary organizations in $COUNTRY$. This sparked outrage on virtually every side, as the hardliners condemn the moderates for allowing such an unstable construct to exist in the first place, while more democratic factions denounce the vanguardists for disrespecting the will of the people. The facade of the socialist republic is crumbling, and first reports of political violence in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are coming in. Analysts agree that another such incident would break apart the socialist republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP10.A;Troubling indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP11.T;The Collapse of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Socialist Bloc;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP11.D;Polling stations closed and the count has been halted, after the vanguardists officially dissolved the socialist bloc and thus cancelled the election over disputes with the moderates have reached a boiling point, while there has been growing speculation that popular rivals from reactionary circles and within the own bloc declared they would contest the polls with their own lists, if the elections were to be won by the vanguardists. With the total collapse of the ruling unity party, the streets of $COUNTRY$ are filled with political violence against the perceived injustice from all sides, the young socialist republic seems to meet its end sooner rather than later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP11.A;Can't there be peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP12.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Communist Coup of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
DODFFP12.D;After a string of cancelled elections and the collapse of cohesion within the ruling amalgamation of various socialist political organizations, the radical vanguardists have taken the matters into their own hands and have stormed the streets of $CAPITAL$ to purge the moderate factions! Many, however, escaped, and started to organize a united front with factions within the military and more reactionary parties to reestablish a true democracy after the experiences made with failed attempt at a socialist republic. Whether the coup will succeed will be decided in the coming hours in the streets of $CAPITAL$, at the cost of those idealists who believed that the socialist revolution has already succeeded...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

In time, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ values of equality in brotherhood have evolved into a shining beacon for other countries who share these ideals in Europe which will force the aristocrats of a bygone age to recognise that their stubborn isolation and hostility of their empires is not sustainable in an industrialising world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

fascist_flashpoint_desc;The country has reached a tipping point. With civil strife and disorder being the norm, the fascists in government have been given full powers by our head of state to restore order and calm to the country.

DODFFP13.T;The Legacy of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP13.D;As the success of $COUNTRY$ and its republican values despite the hostile royalist environment weakens the cause of the reactionary forces of Europe immensely, the Great German Revolution of the last century seems to have redeemed itself after all: The curious $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Republics' policies are now focused on alleviating other liberal nations of Europe from the hardships of blockade and sanction against the yoke of those who use their power to preserve the status quo of the Treaty of Paris of 1820. Thus, at last, the dawn of a new age of diplomacy where nations conduct trade not based on ideology only shines through the many borders of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DODFFP16.D;The destruction of the reactionary government has led to the end of its colonial projects. Across the world, the native proletariat so long oppressed by the regime directed by the bureaucrats of $CAPITAL$ are rising up agsinst the old order. We now face a choice. There are hardliners within our regime who believe that these people are not ready to implement socialism without our guidance, and that these uprisings are manifestations of local reactionary tendencies. Others believe that we must negotiate with indigenous communities and create new socialist states governed by the native proletariat in order to create a more equitable society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DODFFP16.B;Their civilizations are net yet prepared for socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP17.T;Fascists Clamour for More Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP17.D;A minority group in our government - "fascists" as the rogue publications like to call them - is gradually gaining momentum. Due to our current woes - whether it'd be foreign or domestic, trying to clamp down on them seems the most impossible. To our shock - one of them approached us with the proposition of an "alliance" - a "helping hand" to ease these woes. Should we agree to such a deal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP17.A;Approve it - What could ever go wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP17.B;No. We have no use for rascals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
DODFFP18.T;Fascist Coup in $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP18.D;The inevitable has occurred. Various thoroughfares in the capital have been barricaded by Fascist sympathizers - both military and common folk, giving it an eerie appearance of being under siege. Numerous figures have either disappeared or have been found dead in various places. Our government is paralyzed and the populace aghast upon witnessing this travesty. Meanwhile, on the radio, our dear $MONARCHTITLE$ has been hastily preparing a  speech to the nation, proving to be decisive given the moment, with the memorable words:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP18.A;"...We shall be steadfast. Glory to $COUNTRY_ADJ$!";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP18.B;"...We shall stop this menace, once and for all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
DODFFP19.T;The Fascist Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP19.D;A lot of politicians in our legislature have always been at edge with the Reds, always ever threatening to lock up any piece of legislation they seem not fit. Many of our parliamentarians, as expected, are ever worried by the Red threat. Seemingly enough, our hardliner members have proposed a coalition agreement with the Fascists - alongside giving them "special privileges" in judicial and state affairs, in the light of our country's current struggles - to end this menace once and for all. If such "popular fronts" proved relatively popular among the sycophantic Reds, wouldn't it hurt to have ours too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP19.A;Futile times need strong measures. We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP19.B;...and allow them to take over the government. No deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
DODFFP20.T;The "Death Squads";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP20.D;Our recent policy of allowing fascist groups a free hand has borne fruit. The news media reports that countless leftist, liberal and even conservative personalities in our country have been attacked, harassed, and even killed by fascist paramilitaries. These so called "death squads" have been very effective in stifling the Left, and by extension are crucial in the further entrenchment of fascist power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP20.A;At least they are effective at resolving the socialist problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP21.T;Fascist Intimidation in the Populace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP21.D;Fascist paramilitaries in $CAPITAL$ and other various major cities in $COUNTRY$ have been hard at work trying to spread their rhetoric to the common folk. Be it radio, print media, or even word of mouth, many Fascist volunteers have begun to spread the word of their cause, even resorting to extrajudicial and sinister means. Due to our policies, stopping them any further seems impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP21.A;This is getting out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP210.T;Terrorist Attack in $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP210.D;It was during the early morning of $DATE_LONG_0$ when the capital city of $CAPITAL$ was awoken to a loud, crackling bang. Many have been reported injured (and even presumed dead), and several national government buildings have been damaged beyond repair and are in flames. The attackers, mysteriously, were seemingly apprehended a couple of hours after the attack, with identity documents showing that they are Communist paramilitaries, aiming to overthrow the government. Our Fascist allies, as usual, have quickly sprung forth to action and demanded immediate emergency powers and mandates to "restore calm". How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP210.A;What could possibly go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP210.B;I've had enough - Kick them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP22.T;Fascist Sentiment Dies Down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP22.D;Time has proven to be the Fascist's worst enemy. Either it'd be due to our present government policies that explicitly forbid these kinds of parties from ever forming or a clause in our Constitution that prohibits them from ever doing so irregardless of any progress they have made to undermine and subvert our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP22.A;What a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP23.T;Anti-Fascist Party Wins Election!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP23.D;With the resounding victory of a couple of "anti-fascist" parties in government that aim to stifle the fascist threat in our country, it that many of the fascist agitators in our government and among the populace were forced to go to hiding due to fear of reprisals or the sudden tide of public opinion going against them. Coupled with the $MONARCHTITLE$'s orders that repealed the laws that gave Fascist personalities free reign over public and state affairs, it seems that the fascist scum have met their doom... Hopefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DODFFP25.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP25.D;Foreign observers are at shock as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascist paramilitaries and supporters have staged a "special political operation" in the capital city of $CAPITAL$ as reaction to a recent electoral victory of an assortment of anti-fascist parties. Many analysts have pointed out that prior to these events the tense political climate in $COUNTRY$, along with the past government's prior policies that have favored the fascists, has accommodated to the gradual fomenting of fascist sentiment among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Hours after the coup, many anti-fascist & opposition leaders have begun fleeing from the country, contemplating on establishing a government-in-exile. Foreign leaders from all sides on the other hand, have both welcomed and ridiculed this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP25.A;We shall purge the Blanquist nightmare. Glory to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP26.T;Fascists have seized power in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP26.D;Foreign observers are in shock as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascists, assumed total control of the country. Relentless efforts of cementing their power either due to a combination of electoral successes, immense popular support, or both are the leading reasons for such an occurrence. Critics have pointed out though, that previous government policies have loosened restrictions or gave concessions to fascist groups, proving a turning point in light of these events. Hours after the coup, many anti-fascist & opposition leaders have begun fleeing from the country, contemplating on establishing a government-in-exile. Foreign leaders from all sides on the other hand, have both welcomed and ridiculed this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DODFFP27.T;Fascists have seized power in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP27.D;After a massive targeted terror attack by presumably Blanquist agitators in the capital of $COUNTRY$, the fascists have announced their intention to lead a "temporary caretaker government" - immediately suspending habeas corpus and announcing major restrictions on civil liberties as an effort to restore order and stability in the country. Political analysts and antifascist leaning critics alike have likened this as a ruse to further cement Fascist control in the country - allowing for the gradual stifling of civil rights and policies that further the formation of a totalitarian state. Hours after the coup, many anti-fascist & opposition leaders have begun fleeing from the country, contemplating on establishing a government-in-exile. Foreign leaders from all sides on the other hand, have both welcomed and ridiculed this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP27.A;We shall purge the Blanquist nightmare. Glory to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP28.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Enabling Act of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP28.D;Upon the passing of the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, their valiant fascist allies in parliament have simultaneously expressed their condolences and sprung up to action planning to put the colloquial termed "Enabling Act" into motion, a trigger law with provisions that allow the fascist party to (1) irrevocably assume of all State functionaries, (2) becoming the sole legal party in government, and (3) enact laws without the $MONARCHTITLE$ consent. However with the passing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, the Head of Government has seized this initiative to assume full control of the government paving the way for a novel and potentially resurgent totalitarian state. Hours after this siezure of power, many anti-fascist & opposition leaders have begun fleeing from the country, contemplating on establishing a government-in-exile. Foreign leaders from all sides on the other hand, have both welcomed and ridiculed this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding the dangers of foreign opposition and the repugnant ramblings of Blanquist scum, we have prevailed ever victorious in this fusion of an empowered State with the $MONARCHTITLE$ at its helm. With the immediate, forceful dissolution of parliament as per royal decree, the leader of the Fascist party has begun formulating their plans to restore the Fatherland to its greatness and to subdue all Her enemies who threaten to sneer or mock this new valiant and great course.

Ours is a land where the chains of capital have been broken, and which shall never waver in our quest for the Socialist World Republic that will unite all of humanity.

Our is a land where the ways of the past have been seamlessly wed to the technology of the future, and which shall cast the lies of the old world down to forge a new one in our image.

Now the older generation remember our previous years as the ‘good ole days’, never to return. The days when we were the superpower, the global policeman of the world is now gone. Our military might has degraded, the surety of our economic system and political governance now challenged from abroad and within. The winds of change have occurred and now we stand in the shadow of lost glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
DODFFP31.A;The Sun has set;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP32.T;The Future of Socialism in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP32.D;The continuous victories of socialist parties in recent elections has demonstrated a popular mandate for the left, but its vision remains undefined. For some, leftism is not merely an ideology, but the inevitable path of humanity into a brighter future. In the name of doctrinal clarity, leading leftist ideologists have gathered in $CAPITAL$ for a congress to determine the future of the movement. The congress must decide : should the left embrace a fully revolutionary bent, endorsing Internationalist Socialism, the overthrow of international capital, and the unification of mankind under the red flag - even if it means the purging of reactionary elements upon taking power? Or should the left instead endorse Social Democracy, working within the preexisting system of our nation and aim for steady reform? Is there only one path to utopia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP32.A;Yes, and it will come through the Internationalists and revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP32.B;Yes, and it will come through Social Democracy and reform!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP33.T;The Fire Falters;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP33.D;And that was it. Another reform was passed and nobody in the crowd seemed to disagree, because anyone who did was drowned by the cheers of the multitude. With that, they accepted their defeat and enjoyed the fruits of our victory. We didn't even need to expand our ideals by force, because we only had to prove our point to make others want to follow our example. Our recent reforms, providing an expansive social safety net and widespread economic security to the vast majority of our citizens, have smothered the flames of Internationalist Socialism. There are those who said that utopia was unreachable, but now we have proven them wrong. A utopia is possible. It already exists. We, the Social Democracy, are the utopia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP33.A;Reform conquers all, even Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP34.T;The Fire Falters;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP34.D;The Social Liberals were always unwilling partners with the Internationalist Socialists. Preferring reform and the expansion of social programs and democracy to throwing bombs and assassinating officials, the Social Liberals worked with the Internationalists only as a matter of necessity. Now, with the Social Liberals' recent electoral dominance, they have cut the Internationalists loose. By controlling the legislative and executive branches, they now stand unchallenged, able to change the nation as they see fit. The Internationalists, weak and incapable, their radical ideology discredited in the eyes of all but the most fanatical believers, are forced to comply. The future of the left, at least in $COUNTRY$, lies in moderate democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP34.A;Reform, not Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP35.T;The Fire Rises;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP35.D;Despite their best efforts, the Social Democrats of $COUNTRY$ have been entirely discredited. Now crowds have filled $CAPITAL$, enraged at our failures. Many have joined beneath the banner of Internationalism and Communism, declaring social democracy to be rife with weakness and politically bankrupt. Now they want a new strategy : world revolution towards the Socialist World Republic, the promised era when socialism is triumphant not just in $COUNTRY$ but across the Earth. However, the reactionaries also oppose the Communist cause, and we could partner with rightist parties and their paramilitary forces to crush the Internationalists. This would be a desperate act, one which would go down in the annals of leftist history as an eternal and unforgivable betrayal. But if we wish for $COUNTRY$ to take any path other than committing to the liberation of the world’s millions of proletarians by peace or force, then we have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP36.A;We belong here, in power, even if by rightist bayonets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP36.B;We belong out there, in the streets, with the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP36.T;The Revolution is Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP36.D;A knock on your door at midnight. A dose of poison in your drink. A pistol shot as you walk down the street. The anti-Communist purge could take any form.\n\nWe have done the unthinkable, partnering with the reactionaries to crush the revolution. The streets are quiet, aside from the faint smoldering of half-quenched fires, the occasional shattering of already broken glass, and the jackboots of rightist paramilitaries. The Internationalists are in full retreat, their leadership dead, under arrest, or in exile. Any semblance of leftist unity has been destroyed. Already, recriminations are beginning within Social Democratic circles over what has been done. Time will tell if the empowered right will turn against us. For now, our nation is coming to grips with a new chapter in its history, as pluralism and socialism become increasingly discredited in the eyes of the general public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP36.A;A Red-Brown Alliance can only end one way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP37.T;The End of An Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP37.D;The communist uprisings and the resulting government purges have both begun to fade from the public consciousness. The scars in the memory of the people have healed enough that some politicians are considering allowing the Communists to once again participate in elections. Old guard politicians and members of the police and military dismiss them as naive fools, but few remember the turmoil which $COUNTRY$ faced during its aborted revolution. We also suspect some of the new generation of political leaders have radical sympathies : but times have changed, and taking aggressive measures against them will only hurt our image. It is unfortunate then that we expect the anti-communist laws to be repealed with a resounding majority. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP37.A;They will regret this soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP38.T;The Internationalists Make their Move!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP38.D;Our partnership with the Internationalists was always going to come with a catch, and now, unfortunately, it is time to pay the piper. The Internationalists assert that the recent crises plaguing our nation have one cause : the perfidious forces of reaction. Indeed, the Internationalists have gone so far as to suggest that to save socialism we must destroy our reactionary enemies before they destroy us. As such, they have proposed a rash of reforms with the ultimate goal of forcing all non-socialist parties underground. We could go along with this proposal, with the result being the end of democracy in our nation. On the other hand, we could refuse the Internationalists, though this would almost certainly result in a general strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP38.A;Destroy the forces of reaction!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

He argues that the attempt of the Representatives to do away with the monarchy without a public referendum is unconstitutional and proves that the Government is uninterested in listening to the voices of the people. Thus he has rallied a cabal of right wing officers, mainline politicians, and even some moderate socialists around him in order to put a stop to the revolution! Meanwhile, communist militias have been summoned to the capital to defend us from the march of this “White Army.” Both forces seem evenly matched, and the resulting battle could go either way…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DODFFP40.T;The Radical Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP40.D;The locals gather at the harbor on a beautiful morning, as a ship in the distance disappears over the horizon. One passenger - the former $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, now bereft of all his possessions save the clothes he wears - was not allowed to board, pulled out of the line and sent to a reeducation center like all of the other common reactionaries. The ship departs, and the people return to their new reality. It is a reality of socialism, one of welfare and equality. Inside one of the rooms of the palace, Communist Party officials and generals examine a map of the nation, festooned with notes, drawings, and pictures of strategic points, enemies of the state and rebel groups. They discuss foreign policy, national security, and economic development. This new period will be one of wild and wondrous change, as we continue to fight to unite the human race. Victory shall bring nothing less than the Socialist World Republic. Eventually, it will all be worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP40.A;Soon, all the workers around the globe shall bear the same flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP41.T;The Awakening of the Sleeping Giant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP41.D;The Communist Party of $COUNTRY$ is in an uproar over a message from the socialists. They declare that they have abandoned plans to rewrite the constitution, a plan popular with the Communists though criticized by more moderate leftists. The goal was to establish communism without discarding democracy. But unlike the moderate socialists, the communists have no qualms about revolutionary violence. Given this “blatant and heartless betrayal,” as they put it, the Communists are locked in debate over whether to attempt an armed revolt to seize power and avert a drawn-out conflict which might lead to civil war or worse, the destruction of their party. The socialists, aware of the impending communist insurrection, have mobilized the authorities to arrest major communist figures, but those attempts may not be enough to stop the sleeping giant of the Communists’ legions of workers and peasants from rising up with their leaders..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP41.A;This is a democracy, we only follow the will of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP41.B;That's it! Take your rifles, comrades! To victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP42.T;The $COUNTRY$ Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP42.D;”Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the world, unite!” - Cornelius Blanqui\nThe doors blast open, as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Red Army swoops down upon the helpless politicians hiding within. As the prisoners march out, they hear echoes of gunfire, see the parliament’s steps splattered with blood, and realize their captors are the same peasants and factory workers they once scorned. The old head of state has vanished, and the red flag now waves over their palace, prideful above the ruins of the old order. Leftist revolutionaries, bolstered by defectors from the Altes Regime, have triumphed, and the forces of reaction are in full retreat. The jails of $COUNTRY$ are crammed with "enemies of the revolution" awaiting trial, while industries are nationalized and new social programs created. Blanqui’s dreams have leapt from the pages of the Communist Manifesto and into reality, as the red star rises over $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

betrayal_of_the_left;Betrayal of the Left ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
betrayal_of_the_left_desc;The alliance between the Social Democrats and the Internationalists was always one of convenience. Now, that alliance has broken down. The Social Democrats have managed, through ballot and bullet, with or without rightist agents, to suppress the Communists. Internationalist socialism within $COUNTRY$, and leftist unity writ large, is in chaos. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leftists,, however, are unlikely to either forget or forgive this betrayal anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
constitutional_antiradical;The Anti-Radical Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
constitutional_antiradical_desc;Our government has adopted several provisions excluding the far left and the far right from participating in politics, in the name of keeping the nation safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP43.T;Establishment of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP43.D;The old order has been cast down! With the victory of the revolution, a council of revolutionaries from across the political spectrum has been assembled into the $COUNTRY_AD$ Directory in $CAPITAL$. There they will oversee the political reorganization of our nation. Some have criticized the structure of the provisional government as being insufficiently democratic, but the councilors have stressed the need for freedom of action to defend against counter-revolutionaries. At the moment, the moderates have taken control of the assembly, but their grasp is tenuous, and political extremists on both the left and the right could make plays for power in the coming days.  For now however all segments of our society - except for the old regime’s fanatics - seek to build our new nation and shape its future, a future that is now beautifully unpredictable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP43.A;Together we shall bring forth a new era!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP430.T;Emergency Measures?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP430.D;Loyalists of the old regime remain throughout our society, as well as in emigrant communities abroad. Even now, they may be working against us. Several incidents of loyalists spreading propaganda or plotting rebellion in the name of the previous government have already been reported. Some councilors of the provisional government are now convinced that we must declare a state of emergency in order to suppress these threats as well as to maintain military readiness in case of foreign invasion. After all, they argue, did not Marinus Dahlke, the archetypical revolutionary, introduce extraordinary police powers to protect against both domestic intrigue and the attacks from foreign regimes? Other councilors have countered that Dahlke failed precisely because he became the same sort of tyrant which he had opposed. A vote is now being held to introduce broad powers of censorship and political control in $COUNTRY$...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP430.A;The bill is adopted as a necessary evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP430.B;Those who trade liberty for safety deserve neither and lose both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP44.T;The Abolishment of the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP44.D;While the previous monarch of $COUNTRY$ was forced from power, their dynasty has not actually relinquished their claim to the throne, nor has the monarchy itself been legally abolished. At present it is dormant - yet still lingers. Many councilors in the provisional government are now pushing to officially abolish the monarchy. Monarchism, they say, is an inherently oppressive form of government in which society is stratified, innovation is stifled in the name of tradition, and some citizens are held as superior to others - to say nothing of the financial burden of maintaining the Crown and the nobility. However, a vocal minority sees the monarchy as a useful political tool. They argue that we merely need to strip all political and economic powers from the monarchy, whereupon we can use it to support our new government - and deny the monarchists a martyr to rally around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP44.A;The monarchy may endure as a ceremonial institution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP44.B;The time has come for a republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP45.T;The Question of the Head of State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP45.D;One of the grievances of many revolutionaries was the major role of the executive branch in the previous government. Time and time again, it is argued, the head of state’s power blocked the will of the people and forced through unpopular measures. Many councilors demand that the provisional government either reduce the executive branch to a ceremonial status or at least assign its most dangerous powers to the hands of the legislature, where they are less likely to be used without cause. However this proposal has drawn fire from those who charge that the councilors, assuming that they will compose our new legislature, are merely hoarding power for themselves. Others have pointed out instances in our history where the head of state overcame obstruction by the legislature to the nation’s benefit. Two constitutional provisions have been drafted, one with a strong executive, and one without, but only one can be adopted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP45.A;The power of the head of state must be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP45.B;We cannot allow an imperial executive branch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP46.T;The Question of the Head of State ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP46.D;One of the grievances of many revolutionaries was the minor role of the executive branch in the previous government. Time and time again, it is argued, the head of state’s weakness allowed the legislature to block the will of the people and force through unpopular measures. Many councilors demand that the provisional government strengthen the executive branch to be able to balance the legislature. However this proposal has drawn fire from other councilors who fear that this could lead to the head of state becoming tyrannical. Others have pointed out that the legislature was given power precisely because of previous points in our history where autocratic rulers had no restraints. Two constitutional provisions have been drafted, one with a strong executive, and one without, but only one can be adopted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP46.A;We cannot allow an imperial executive branch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP46.B;The power of the head of state must match the legislature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP47.T;A Secret Police Force?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP47.D;The continued presence of loyalists to the old regime - or dissident radicals who refuse to cooperate with the provisional government - in $COUNTRY$ has stirred some councilors to propose new security measures. These have involved the creation of a special, national police organization which would conduct clandestine operations against enemies of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. It has also been argued that such an agency would be a useful defense against foreign subversion of the revolution. However, other councilors have protested that these organizations are quite similar to those employed by the old regime to hunt the types of people who now staff our provisional government. As such they denounce the idea of a secret police organization as inherently oppressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP47.A;It is needed to fight extremism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP47.B;We would be just as immoral as the old regime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP48.T;Political Restrictions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP48.D;The provisional government is an ostensible alliance of all members of the dissident spectrum. With that being said, there are certain members of the fringe left and right which many councilors do not wish to allow into the halls of power. Therefore it has been suggested to adopt certain anti-radical provisions. Given the militancy and ruthlessness of some extremist factions, this measure might be a necessary safety precaution for our nation. However it has been severely criticized even by councilors in the political center, who decry placing hard limits on political freedom within $COUNTRY$. So long as a party does not seek to restore the old regime or destroy the state, they argue, they have no reason to be excluded from government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP48.A;We cannot allow extremists to take advantage of our constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP48.B;Liberty for everyone or for no one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP49.T;The Conscription Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP49.D;The socialist parties have made repeated pushes for the end of military conscription. They have denounced this system for forcing innocent citizens to sacrifice life and limb at the whims of the government, while also noting that conscription disproportionately affects the lower classes who cannot afford to evade it, something which is often done by wealthier citizens. They argue instead that conscription should be made an emergency measure only to be used during wartime. Other councilors have accused the socialist parties of weakening the nation, protesting that conscription is necessary to protect the revolution against hostile foreign regimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP49.A;We must cease forcing our citizenry onto the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP49.B;The strength of the armed forces must be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP50.T;The Plot against $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP50.D;The Directory has assembled quite a lot of power as of late. In the course of its existence, it has used this power to target those who sought to oust it from power or replace it with a rival institution. As the power of the Directory continues to entrench itself, fewer and fewer organizations are left to oppose it. Now some councilors are aiming to have the Directory’s control of society made permanent! In an anonymous pamphlet being circulated by the plotters, they declared that the revolution’s success must be shepherded by its creators. We believe that we have identified several councilors and military officers conspiring towards such ends. Arresting them and their sympathizers could put an end to this danger, unless they manage to strike first…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP50.A;Purge these aspiring tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP50.B;Long live the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Directory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP51.T;The Return of Democracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP51.D;The provisional government was dissolved this morning, pending the election of our new government. The new constitution which it created will hopefully protect the rights of our people and guide us towards a nation greater than that of the old regime. In the course of its existence the provisional government withstood both foreign pressures and domestic intrigues, yet refused to waver from its commitment to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP51.A;Long live the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP52.T;Dissolution of the Provisional Government ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP52.D;Whether by the ballot or the bullet, the Directory has lost its power, overcome by the political forces of its rivals. The political changes which it wrought are being undone, and its legacy is now in question. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ future is once again in question, and nobody can say which group will rise to fill their vacuum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP52.A;May our nation find unity once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP53.T;Amendment of the Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP53.D;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ constitution possesses several restrictions which in theory prevent an extremist political party from taking power. Despite these measures, a radical party - located either on the left or the right - has now managed to form a new government. Their first priority was to pass a new constitutional amendment which has eliminated previous restrictions on political activity. This has opened the door to a surge in activism by parties of all stripes, though naturally the administration has supported their allies above all. Yet the reverberations of this change will be felt for generations to come, as a new era of wild politics in $COUNTRY$ is inaugurated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP53.A;The people have spoken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP54.T;Expiration of the Anti-Radical Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP54.D;Our laws restricting public activity by certain forms of political parties expired this morning when a vote to renew them failed in the legislature. Multiple politicians argued that the provisions were no longer necessary, given the stability of the nation. These views were criticized by other officials who chided their opposite numbers for confusing the results of the restrictions with lack of a need for them. They have prophesied that ending the anti-radical laws will spread chaos throughout $COUNTRY$. It seems that only time will tell if the are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP54.A;Liberty, for better or for worse. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DODFFP55.T;Hegemon of the Pacific Ocean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DODFFP55.D;Our control over the Central Pacific has put us in a special position to allow us to project our naval power throughout the entire Pacific Ocean. This will not only bring us prestige, but also give us an edge in trade throughout the region. Naturally we will have to increase our investments in our navy in order to ensure that our naval forces are up to the task of protecting our new thalassocracy. Naval training will become more rigorous to separate the wheat from the chaff, sailors will be expected to work harder, but in exchange they will reap the glory of being a part of our grand navy. This may harm our research into our armed forces, but sacrifices must be made for the glory of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Naturally we will have to increase our investments in our navy in order to ensure that our naval forces are up to the task of protecting our new thalassocracy.

Without the need to maintain our naval superiority we have already begun scaling back our investments in the navy, and its once prestigious position within our nation has begun to erode. If we wish to reclaim our thalassocracy we will need to secure control over Kaigan and Hawaii. Until then we can only dream of the days when we ruled the waves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cross_into_burgundy_desc;The Consolidation of the Burgundian Kingdom after the War on the Rhine and the subsequent Treaty of Frankfurt of 1498 meant that the left bank of the Rhine river slipped out of the control of the various local prince-bishoprics and counties for next centuries. Ever since then, this humiliation was attempted to be reversed by the various Jagiellon emperors, and Bohemia would crush the Burgundian army in the Grand Battle of Mainz of 1812 during the Great German War which humiliated Burgundy, granting Bohemia occupation of Alsace and the Confederation of the Rhine. This was reversed in the final Peace of Paris of 1820, however, and Prague has been longing for the Rhineland ever since. Now, the time has come to reclaim the lands once and for all from the hands of Burgundy and for the sacrifice of Wenceslaus V!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC123111;Germany is now fully unified but the problem of Bohemia is still there. Prague sits in the middle of the German lands and the hardcore nationalists call for the same treatment that the German nation received from Prague with the total occupation of the country along with all other known German lands in Europe. They are a minority, most of the complaints being about Silesia. The densely populated and industrialized region has many Germans around Breslau and Lower Silesia, making part of the Greater German Nation. Some also call for the annexation of whole Silesia, but most of the territories in the South are populated by Poles and Czechs. Of course all groups can agree that Saxony should be the primary target of any invasion into Bohemia if we somehow do not own it already and even the most pacifistic will not stand for the continued occupation of Saxony by the Bohemians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC95620;The Treaty of Selon was signed by Burgundy, Spain, England-France and Scandinavia in the 18th Century, guaranteeing peaceful and trade-oriented development of European power projection in the Far East. This very treaty ensures that Asian nations cannot be directly attacked or turned into protectorates by European nations and has resulted in a sense of peace and security from European interests. This has resulted in a lack of care to "civilize" by almost all Asian nations with the exceptions of both Japan and Korea and may result in future foreign policy disasters..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC95621;The Treaty of Selon has been abolished and whatever protections that it granted over Asian Nations has gone with it.

The present and most bloody stage of this war has raged on since Eighteen-Twenty-Four and Lusitania has finally given up being friendly towards our cause and unilaterally declared a separate republic in the hope that if they defeat us then they shall not be annexed by Spain again. Deodoro Peixoto, the Lustanian Tetrarch has already disavowed his involvement with that movement and it is likely that this is the doing of rogue elements inside that region. Already there are rumours in the south of another potential revolt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLM72.D;It has been fifty years since the foundation of the Tetrarchy that had reorganized the Colombian Alliance into a single unified nation. This nation had prevailed against both Spain and its own instabilities to become the single unified power it that it is today. However, there is now a critical concern that as the century continues our power is starting to decline and that the Inca and Arcadian powers will eventually surpass us. We must also be concerned at the growing nationalist movements in both Lusitania and Granada are threatening to tear our nation to pieces with the implicit agenda of deciding where our capital shall be located regardless of any potential compromise. We must choose where we stand on the idea of the capital moving and what our intent is regarding future expansion IMMEDIATLY or risk our potential collapse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95622;For hundreds of years, the new world was considered a bastion of adventure and freedom from being a citizen of a European nation. However, as immigrants arrive in the new world in the aftermath of the Great German Wars: they find a continent that is perpetually locked in endless wars with either colonial powers or between themselves. This information has been slowly spread around the whole world and it is universally agreed upon that it would better to stay in Europe then run the risk of being trapped in bloody nightmare that is the new world. It would take a period of relative peace to break this reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95623;The Nightmare is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95623;A sense of relative peace has passed over the new world as most major post-colonial conflicts have been resolved in one way or another.

LOT1.T;Federation of Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation is the latest country to emerge independent in Ameriga following the chaotic decades that began with Lotharingian independence. Amazonia is deeply divided between Equinoxia in the West which refuse to compromise with Slaveholders from Antarctica. about the issue of slavery. The status quo holds because of the Atlantian referendum that is going to be held in 1841 and which will see either the autonomous area under the supervision of Spain going independent or joining our glorious nation.§RAtlantia will become independent in 1841 leading to either a peaceful annexation or war§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.A;Amazonia Forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.T;The Republic of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beornia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.A;We will recover Atlantia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.T;The Monarchist Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.D;Lotharingia had devolved into a civil war after the republic failed upon the election of a monarchist to the Presidency. Still, the tensions continue and it is likely that there may be even another revolt if we fail to fix this monarchist issue at some point. So, a compromise must be made with the Monarchists and the current ruling Dictatorship or we may never be able to reconquer the territory of Atlantia. Alternatively we can just ignore the requests of the monarchists and try and reconquer Atlantia without them, but it will likely be extremely difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT3.B;Execute these traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.T;Denis de Aigle's Glorious Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.D;The President has declared that all men, women and children must be involved in what should be considered as the rightful glorious reconquest of Atlantia. In turn, the Congress has voted with a one hundred and ten percent majority to declare war on Amazonia and mobilize all possible citizens. This will be the final chance for Lotharingia to retake what is rightfully theirs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.A;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.T;The Atlantia Counter-Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.D;The region of Atlantia had refused to deal with the monarchists and had declared its independence from Lotharingia before being promptly annexed by Amazonia a decade ago. However, as Lotharingia has become a Constitutional Monarchy with more power to the people rather then the Kings. Many in Atlantia have been questioning why they should stay with a former colony of the Dual-Monarchy that did not even want to declare independence for a extremely extended period of time and rather join with their monarchist, but at least democratic brethren in Lotharingia. This question has come to a head today as Atlantia has now officially declared succession from the federation and has immediately rejoined the Oriental Kingdom of Lotharingia to the utter shock of everyone in $CAPITAL$. We could either act upon this and fight for land that is not even rightfully ours according to the rest of the continent or should we just give up the land and allow Lotharingia to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.A;Send the Ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.B;They can keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.T;Amazonian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.D;The government of the Amazonian Federation has presented a ultimatum regarding the succession of Atlantia from their nation. We must immediately revoke all claims to the territory and not attempt to fight the Amazonian Army when it attempts to occupy the region of Atlantia for the second time or we will be declared war upon and forced to relinquish this territory by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.A;We will not give into their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.B;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.T;The Monarchy Collapses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.D;Whatever prestige the monarchy had after losing this extremely critical war to Amazonia was effectively destroyed today as a rather large amount of citizens barged their way into the Royal Palace and executed the king in his own bedroom before proclaiming a new democratic republic. The military has attempted to restore order by countering these large mobs of citizens with arms fire but the conflict has turned out to be bloody and long as the mobs have broken into the general staff headquarters. If the general staff is destroyed it is unlikely that the military will be able to successfully restore the loyalist government, but there is a equal chance that the mobs will be dispersed before it comes to that. At this point, victory is up in the air for either faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL90.D;We have received a strange letter from the Duchy of Parma requesting that we appoint a member of the Farnese Dynasty as a General. The individual in question is Antonio Farnese, a abnormally young pick to be a general but it seems that he is nothing less then a absolute genius in every regard.

VAL92.D;When the news that Europe had erupted into a liberal revolution, unseen since the infamous German revolutions ultimately arrived at the court of the King of Provence. The General, Antonio Farnese immediately presented a list of demands to the court stating that if they are not heeded, it is likely that this country may find itself annexed by the Dual Monarchy or even worse: made a republic. Universal Voting, A full parliament, rights and liberties to be given to each and every citizen. Insanity, but he is a genius after all. We should consider listening to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL93.T;The Inevitable Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL93.D;Antonio Farnese had taken over every single aspect of the Provencal Army inside of a few years after he was granted his title.

The demands that were previously refused have been accepted as the King has been replaced by someone more willing to listen to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL94.D;The Kingdom of Italy has been created under our rule and yet Antonio Farnese had clearly not had enough power in this new government.

Nobody disagreed with him, not even the parliament that he dissolved with the help of the military. So, upon this day the Valois dynasty ends and the rise of the Farnese Dynasty is upon us.

GER40.T;A Phoenix in Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER40.D;He who comes not today, tomorrow surely comes, but slowly doth the oak awaken, and he who goes softly goes well, so runs the German proverb. The German Eagle has seen better days, and it is beyond question that it is the fault of those who held the Rhenish, the Elbians and the Danubians under their yoke. But in recent years, a whisper emerged in the dark alleys of the cities on a Rhine, then mumbling in the factories and stores of Danubia until even the Elbians, who usually submitted to the authority of Prague, joined the emerging chorus: Germany still exists! The dream carried by the descendants of those left behind in the Great German War will never die. The weakness of the Burgundians, Scandinavians and Bohemians is now reinspiring a new national awakening across the former Holy Roman Empire which echoes throughout our controlled territories. Intellectuals are drafting new constitutions, servants of the state are suddenly turning their back to orders given by Anvers, Prague or Kopenhagen and old flags thought lost to the test of time reemerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GER36.T;The Second German Council - Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER36.D;A Second German Council has taken place and has offered a $FROMCOUNTRY$ a crown. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted this crown and has almost overnight created a new "Liberal Kingdom of Germany" which has for all intents and purposes permanently shattered the ability for the Holy Roman Empire to project any power that it once had over Germany. This is a international embarrassment for Bohemia and must not go unpunished. There are currently two plans that have been drafted to prevent this new Danubian Confederation to project any dangerous influence over the rest of Germany- one is a more straightforward approach which involves the immediate invasion and destruction of this abomination along with Burgundy which will happily involve itself in and the other is a far more nuanced approach which involves calling a Third Council and de-constructing Germany into spheres of cultural influence and creating a Rhenish Confederation out of a good portion of their territory which will therefore weaken them substantially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER37.D;Rather then immediately declare war on us along with Burgundy for the illegal action of effectively dismantling their sphere of influence overnight. They have decided to offer to come to the negotiation table in $CAPITAL$ and divide Germany up into spheres of influence for our nation, Bohemia and Burgundy. This seems like the only valid path to avoid a catastrophic war in Germany but others feel as if this conference is just a alternative way for Bohemia to infringe on the rights of the Danubian People and dictate the future of Germany on their own accord rather then ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER38.D;The Danubian Confederation has agreed with the plan to host a Third German Council in their capital. It seems that their liberal leadership has fallen into a our trap of thinking that we only had the best intentions for their nation. When they realize just how many concessions are going to be demanded out of them they will either immediately give up on the Council or just pull though because they likely fear a war that could dismantle them more then a treaty that will do far less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER39.T;Third German Council in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER39.D;Aspirations of German unity have taken a blow today in $COUNTRY$ as the Third German Council in $CAPITAL$ has concluded with nothing more then a long list of concessions that $COUNTRY$ has been ordered to pay for their continued existence as a nation state. These concessions include the immediate succession, or revocation of claims over Slovenia. The succession of all non-Danubian territories and the permission to create a reactionary confederation in the north that both denies us the birthplace of the German Revolution and Hesse. Various politicians in $COUNTRY$ are already calling for the expulsion of Bohemian and Burgundian Diplomats for this travesty of a "council", but others agree with the Great Powers because the alternative is the complete destruction of the Liberal Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE77.T;A Council in Prague?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE77.D;There have been serious unfortunate events in Central Europe that have left many minor German states wondering if their autonomy is still relevant in this modern world. They look to the strongest state in Central Europe as perhaps a unifying force that may allow them to not fall to either republicanism or other forms of extremism. For a short moment in the history of this Empire it may be possible to come to a agreement with the princes and at least partially unify the decaying remains of the Holy Roman Empire if not a full unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE78.T;The Council of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE78.D;The condition of Germany has become intolerable for the King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. After a catastrophe which has resulted in damage to the legitimacy of this title, it has been made abundantly clear that the old order is breaking down and being rebuilt in the image of various liberal or foreign groups. A council has been called in Prague to attempt to resolve these various issues and conflicts between the various princes and groups of the Holy Roman Empire and perhaps even allow for the centralization of the Holy Roman Empire or a alternative centralized state if that is deemed impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410078.A;This is going to be messy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.T;The Rhine Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.D;Burgundy has reminded us of the treaty that was signed in the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine and that this Council is a violation of that treaty. The Confederation agrees with Burgundy and it is unlikely that they will agree with the unification of the Holy Roman Empire under any circumstances. Even if such a unification is agreed upon by this council, the Rhenish states would prefer to keep their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410079.A;We have to respect this or risk a war with Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE80.T;A futile claim?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE80.D;The Holy Roman Empire was a state that was often heavily tied into the legitimacy of its emperor. The present emperor no longer has any power over his own state, let alone the empire any more. Council members have presented the argument that should such a old state be resurrected if there is no true emperor to rule it any more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410080.A;The Emperor is still the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.T;The Scandinavian Objection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.D;As expected, Scandinavia has presented their opinion that any attempt to centralize either the Holy Roman Empire or any North German State will likely result in an immediate war. As Scandinavia is considered once of the great powers of europe, many council members are wary of the extremely destructive nature of such a potencial war that could occur if the council voted for centralization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410081.A;The Lion of the North cannot scare the Lion of the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE82.T;Transleithania Responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE82.D;The Kingdom of Transleithania has stated that they are the protectors of all South Germans and all other Danubian peoples and that no other state should attempt to claim their lands as belonging to any other empire, regardless if it was the inheritors of Rome or any form of German Empire. As we have no councillors from Austria at this meeting. It is clear that they have no intent to participate and that somewhat further de-legitimises this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410082.A;That state should not even exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.T;The South is Tamed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.D;The southern princes of Bavaria and Austria are both heavily weakened though turmoil in the region and have countless rivals that consist of practically everyone else in the region. As such we have concluded that it would be extremely easy to persuade the councillors of both Austria and Bavaria to vote for the full centralization of the Holy Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410083.A;Easy Prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE84.T;Pommerania is Safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE84.D;Scandinavia has failed to penetrate the north in recent years and that has given relative comfort to the various princes in north Germany. The council members have taken to the stage to outright praise the Bohemian King for his continued protection of the northern region against the dastardly Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410084.A;Germany shall never be their domain again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.T;The Revolutionary Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.D;The primary cause of this council was that of the extreme threat of the Republican Danubian Federation. Many princes are willing to set aside various differences if only to fight the potential threat that comes from these Republican Revolutionaries! At this point centralization is inevitable unless it is proven that the Bohemian King is utterly incompetent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410085.A;The Great German War shall be repeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE86.T;The Scandinavian Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE86.D;Scandinavia has claimed the entire northern portion of Germany and have effectively rendered themselves a extreme threat to all North Germans. There is very little that could prevent complete unification at this point due to the absolute threat that the Scandinavians pose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410086.A;We shall conquer all the way to Jutland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE87.T;The Council of Prague - Total Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE87.D;The Council of Prague has ended in utter failure. Reports coming out of the council state that it had practically devolved into a barrage of insults thrown at the Bohemian King-Emperor and his utter inability for him and his nation to do anything to protect the empire against outside threats. It is expected that this will only hasten the complete collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and for Bohemia to effectively fade into international irrelevance without drastic action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE88.T;The Council of Prague - Elbian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE88.D;The Council of Prague has ended with a agreement to form an Elbian Confederation between all cooperative North German States and Bohemia. The compromise required to reunite the Holy Roman Empire was effectively deemed impossible by the council due to the endless revolutions and the rise of German nationalism throughout central europe but a alternative compromise could be found between the remaining Elbian and North Rheinish princes to treat them as equals under the Bohemian Crown and create a new Elbian Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE90.D;The Council of Prague has ended with a agreement to centralize the Holy Roman Empire. It is clear that this is nothing less then a shock to any european country seeking ambitions over the valuable territories of central europe and expecting that the Holy Roman Empire would decay to a point where it would simply no longer exist under the threat of both German nationalism and liberal revolutions. Even with the signing of a treaty that promises autonomy to Bavaria and does not include the territories of the Confederation of the Rhine, Europe still trembles at the idea of a reborn Holy Roman Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we attempt any form of unification or centralization of the Holy Roman Empire then there WILL be war with whatever state results from this council and they will do ANYTHING they can to dissolve that state. Many princes shrugged off this ultimatum but others are very concerned that if we continue this council we could start a war with Burgundy and that could only result in Bohemia being left in a worse state then it currently is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CFR04.D;After deliberations between the Governments of Burgundy and Bohemia, they have both agreed that the German question will have to be solved by a alternative answer rather then that of a Liberal Kingdom of Germany. This answer is what is known as the Confederation of the Rhine, a barely stable confederation of states which have practically no centralization. It is likely that this state will be used stepping stone for the domination of Germany by both Bohemia and Burgundy and not as a beacon of German liberty or unity in any regard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

geus_status_quo;The Geuzen Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
geus_status_quo_desc;The Geus have been forced into a treaty by Burgundy that effectively states that a form of status quo must be maintained. However, this treaty does not stipulate that the Geuzen are unable to conquer natives if a opportunity occurs were they are able to do so. Nor does it stipulate the political situation in the Northern Geuzen Republics...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAFN01.T;The Geuzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN01.D;The various Geuzen republics of the Cape exert their influence over lands traditionally inhabited by Xhosa, Zulu, and Basotho peoples. These rebellious settlers, scattered through the Cape, living in hostile tribal grounds or small communities, descendants of Dutchmen who settled the Cape long ago, have remained nominally independent from the control of the Duke of Africa, a member of the Burgundian Royalty, who maintains a firm grip over the Cape colony. However, they still are under permanent danger, be it from the Burgundians themselves, the various tribes of the Cape, or even the ever ambitious other Geuzen republics. Surely, with their cunning and superior leadership the Geuzen will survive the trials to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN01.A;The Geuzen shall fold to none!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.T;Skirmishes in the south-west!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.D;There have been reports of skirmishes between Leeuwin and Burgundian forces in our south-western border with the Cape Duchy! The region of Mosselbaal, under firm control of the Duke of Africa, is the target of these skirmishes. Obtaining control of this territory will surely be a boon to our nation and a blow to Burgundian hegemony over the southern Cape. However, we don't know how they'll react if we decide to act further upon the skirmishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.A;Send in reinforcements! Mosselbaal will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN02.B;Signal a retreat, this isn't worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.T;Leeuwin infiltrates Mosselbaal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.D;After light skirmishes were reported all over the eastern border of the Cape Duchy, the Leeuwin forces have practically occupied the contested region of Mosselbaal, for Aloysius, the dictator of Leeuwin and also a member of the royalty, holding this territory means a victory over the Duke of Africa, the rightful lord of the Cape. Surely, such an insult towards his majesty will not go unpunished, lest they become even more emboldened in the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.A;Who cares about the Duchy of the Cape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN03.B;Aloysius has gone too far. Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.T;Victory in the Mosselbaal War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.D;After the foolish attempt by Aloysius, the rebellious dictator, and his men in the rogue state of Leeuwin to wrest control of our territory via subterfuge and aggresion completely backfired, the Burgundian forces march triumphant over the city Ylnerdam, with the Leeuwin forces broken and their populace defeated, they are left with no option but to accept Burgundian rule. surely nobody will dare challenge the hegemony of the Duke of Africa over the lands of the Cape. Let this conflict be a lesson to anyone who would even dare to encroach upon rightful Burgundian land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN04.A;The Cape stands tall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.T;Victory in the Mosselbaal War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.D;Our glorious ruler, Aloysius, in his infinite wisdom, has led Leeuwin to victory against the far superior and better-equipped Burgundian forces. The Burgundians, a menace to the independent republics of the Cape, now stand humilliated, with the Duke of Africa completely defeated and forced to retreat from the Cape. While our populace is tired, and our soldiers want to return home, we have completely obtained control of the Burgundian Cape. Now, the Burgundians have no option but to compromise with us and accept that Aloysius is the sole and rightful ruler of the Cape. Surely, the Burgundians will not ever dare to encroach upon Leeuwin ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN05.A;Leeuwin triumphs, now and forever!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.T;The Military Genius of Aloysius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.D;The Burgundians weren't expecting Aloysius. Not even his own men were expecting him. It all happened in a flash. Aloysius had the burning desire to see the Burgundians out of the Cape, more than ever, and so, he marched with his men against the Burgundian forces in the Cape, completely unprovoked. Nobody knows why he did it, or how he managed to completely destroy Burgundian authority, but he did. Now, the Duchy of the Cape laid in complete control of Leeuwin, and the Duke of Africa was deposed. Surely, Aloysius is one of the greatest military geniuses of our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN06.A;Aloysius had won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.T;Burgundy signs peace!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.D;With the Mosselbal administration infiltrated, and the territory already nominally incorporated into Leeuwin, Aloysius and his men were prepared to face the soldiers coming in from the Cape. They didn't manage to push the Burgundians beyond Mosselbal, but alas, they didn't get pushed back to Ylnderdam either. After various days and numerous casualties, it seemed like the war was going nowhere. With the war heading towards an obvious stalemate, and Leeuwin still holding onto Mosselbal, Aloysius, in his wisdom, decided to initiate peace talks with the Burgundians. Leeuwin would keep Mosselbal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN07.A;A victory is still victory, however small.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.T;The Reurveld Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.D;Sitting on the border of the untamed Matabele savannahs, and bordering the republics of Opstalia and New Flanders, Reurveld is a small Geuzen settlement which, like countless other settlements like itself, has maintained de-facto independence. It has obtained widespread fame due to its prosperity, and has drawn the attention of the administrators of $CAPITAL$ , which are now seeking to assert dominance over the region and incorporate them as an integral part of the republic. Should we decide to further press this claim, Reurweld may call New Flanders to intervene, so it might better to tread carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.A;It is time to establish control over the disparate settlements!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN08.B;Leave Reurveld be, risking a conflict with New Flanders is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.T;Reurveld calls for help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.D;The Reurveld republic, threatened by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ demands of annexation, has decided to turn towards us, pleading for aid against the Opstalian menace. Backing the Reurveld in this struggle, however, could possibly boil over to a major conflict, should negotiations between our nations were to break down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.A;Do we really care about Reurveld?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN09.B;Proclaim our support for Reurveld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.T;New Flanders backs Reurveld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.D;New Flanders, our neighboring republic, has decided to offer their support to the Reurveld. This is an obvious act of aggression against Opstalian interests, and may as well be considered an open declaration of war! This, however, presents the golden opportunity to once and forever end New Flanders, and kill two birds with one stone, by becoming the undisputed ruler of the South African Northlands. In the case that we don't want to risk a conflict with New Flanders, we can always back down from our annexation efforts, but this however will deal a blow to our government's credibility and our people's pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.A;This isn't worth it. We will back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN11.B;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.T;The Reurveld de-escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.D;Amusingly, feeling threatened by our superior army, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to back down on their demands over the Reurveld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN10.A;No blood needed to be shed that day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.T;A Stalemate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.D;Following the breakdown of relations between Opstalia and New Flanders, over the Opstalian annexation of the Reurveld, war broke out. However, with none of the sides making any significant advances for days in either front, the war effort had grinded to a halt and both nations no longer had the will to fight each other anymore. With soldiers tired, hungry, and angry over the conduct of their governments, a treaty of peace was signed between New Flanders and Opstalia, nothing had changed, and blood had been spilled for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN12.A;All of this, for Reurveld? Seriously?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.T;The New Northern Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.D;Following our astounding victory in the Reurveld conflict, we are in complete control of the Northern republics. The Northlanders (distinguished from the Cape Geus) have long been separated between the republics of Opstalia and New Flanders, but this was in the past. We can now become something greater, a union of Northlanders, to ensure the security and stability of the northern Geuzen! This, of course, will not go unnoticed in the south, where both Leeuwin and the Cape Duchy look threaten our way of life. The North will not fall!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.A;Glory to the Northlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN14.T;The Xhosa Conquest of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN14.D;To the Southeast of Leeuwin lie the Xhosa lands. The Xhosa, an ethnic group indigenous to the Eastern Cape, have inhabited these lands for hundreds of years. It is our utmost priority to expand into these lands, before the Burgundians or the Northlanders decide to intrude first! Therefore, our brilliant military strategists, under the wise supervision of Aloysius, have devised a plan to completely dominate the Eastern Cape and establish control of the region. This would open up later opportunities of expansion, as well as giving us a direct border to the dangerous and fierce Zulu lands! We should not underestimate the Xhosa, but were we to achieve victory, the Eastern Cape would become an integral part of our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN13.A;The Eastern Cape will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15;T;Zulu Conquest of Basotholand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15.D;Every day, the European settlers take more and more land around us. Fearing our eventual downfall, our great and wise Inkosi, has decided that an expansion of the realm is necessary if we are to prevail against the European invaders. Therefore, our eyes look westwards, towards Basotholand, we rally the Impis, and the drums of war resonate through the land once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN15.A;Usuthu! Usuthu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.T;Expansion towards Basotholand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.D;The Basotho people, an ethnic group indigenous to the region we call Vrystaat, live in highly decentralized communities scattered called Kraals through the flat grasslands of the Vrystaat, where they have practiced agriculture and herded cattle for centuries. However, given the sparse population of their realm, they should be a target ripe for conquest. Of course, obtaining this region before our rivals will surely be a great boon for our nation, and we would be one step closer to completely dominating the Cape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN16.A;March towards the Vrystaat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.T;Containing the Zulus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.D;The Zulus, the most warlike and aggressive of the scattered tribes of the Cape, are a present danger to Geuzen settlements all over the Cape. Their men fight with unbridled force and zeal, and they will surely prove to be a challenge, were we to invade their lands and pacify them once and for all. However, obtaining control over their realm, shall lead us to a strong regional position, and the natives would be under our control once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN17.A;Strike down the Zulus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.T;The Retreat of the Natives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.D;The Zulu and Basotho, the most prevalent indigenous tribes of the Cape, and prime targets of our expansion, have fled to the Highlands, where they hope to be free from our grasp. Given our position right now, we are in no place to go after them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN18.A;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.T;Regarding the Geuzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.D;King Jean, sole and rightful ruler of the Burgundian Realm, had known that the Geuzen settlers presented a threat to the survival of the Duchy of Africa, Aloysius, the rogue dictator of Leeuwin has been challenging the Duke of Africa's legitimacy, with the Leeuwin growing ever stronger and expanding by the day, What would King Jean decide to do regarding the Geuzen menace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.A;King Jean orders the duke to strike down Aloysius! Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN19.B;King Jean orders the duke not to attack Aloysius! It's not worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.D;The preparations were set. King Jean, as was expected, had granted authority to the Duke of Africa to finally strike down the Leeuwin menace! The Duke, having been expecting this exact moment for years, readied his men and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnderdam would fall, and the traitor Aloysius would finally submit to the Duke of Africa, rightful ruler of the Duchy of the Cape! Of course, the path ahead would not be easy, as the Leeuwin had also been preparing. But with the support of the illustruous King Jean, the duchy would never fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN20.A;The First Geuzen War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.D;King Jean, that blasted traitor, has told the Duke of Africa not to invade Aloysius' realm. What did Jean expect? That the rightful ruler of the Cape would simply stand idly and let Aloysius completely take over the Cape, while he sat there and watched it all burn? The Duke had been waiting for this moment, and it would not be cast down by the designs of a petty King in Anvers! The Cape was the rightful realm of the Duke, after all. So then, the Duke readied his troops, and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnerdam would fall, and Aloysius would be finally struck down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN21.A;The First Geuzen War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN22.T;First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN22.D;The matters of the Duchy of Africa were far beyond the watchful eye of the $MONARCHTITLE$, the Duke already knew this. After all, the Duke's forces had already managed to pre-emptively strike and prematurely ended the Leewuin menace. Burgundian approval would not be needed for the Duke to act! It was time to strike the remaining Northlanders, the Cape was destined to be unified under the thumb of the Duke of Africa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN23.A;The First Geuzen War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN24.T;News from the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN24.D;The Duke of Africa, a member of Burgundian Royalty and the current ruler of the Duchy of the Cape, has sent a warning to King Jean about the inevitability of a widespread conflict breaking out between the Duchy and the Geuzen States. The Duke, emboldened, has assured King Jean that he has the situation under control, and were he to attack the Geuzen, victory would be swift and bloodless. What the King needs now, is to bend the Parliament to his will, so that if a war was needed, the Duke would have all the support needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN24.A;War on the horizon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.T;A plea to the Geuzen States?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.D;With the Geuzen War raging on, it is clear that Aloysius' men can't handle the entire might of the Duchy of the Cape. $COUNTRY$ stands at a crossroads, the leadership could either swallow its pride and request assistance from the Geuzen States to the North. Were they to join us, the Burgundians would stand no chance against the might of the united Geuzen! Of course, Aloysius could always refuse to request their assistance, but what would become of Leeuwin in that case? §RIf they create a alliance then you will need to call them in manually!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.A;Call upon the Geuzen States!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN25.B;We can do this on our own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.T;The Call of Leeuwin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, finding itself in a bloody clash against the Duke of Africa, in a surprising move, has called upon us, to assist them against the Duchy of the Cape! Such a move has surprised us, given the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stance on the Northlander States before. But petty conflicts aside, they're still Geuzen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.A;Of course, we will aid Aloysius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN26.B;Surely, they jest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN27.T;Call our allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN27.D;We are not alone! We have obtained new allies, and we are now ready to ask them to formally join our struggle against the Burgundians! For the Geuzen, and for a Cape free from the clutch of the Burgundians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN27.A;Call upon them! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.T;A plea to the Northlander Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.D;With the Geuzen War raging on, it is clear that Aloysius' men can't handle the entire might of the Duchy of the Cape. Leeuwin stands at a crossroads, the leadership could either swallow its pride and request assistance from the Northlander Union, the Geuzen state to the north, and a rival to our hegemony. Were they to join us, the Burgundians would stand no chance against the might of the two Geuzen powers! Of course, Aloysius could always refuse to plea for aid, but what would become of Leeuwin in that case? §RIf they create a alliance then you will need to call them in manually!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.A;Call upon the Northlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN28.B;Asking the Northlanders for help? Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN29.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, finding themselves in a bloody clash against the Duke of Africa, in a surprising move, he has called upon us, to assist them against the Duchy of the Cape! $FROMCOUNTRY$, under Aloysius, is the sole other Geuzen State in the Cape, we stand in a position of regional power, and were we to succeed in helping them, surely the Burgundians would be kicked out of the Cape, and the Duke of Africa would be no more! Then again, we could also take advantage of the situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN29.A;Of course, we will aid Aloysius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN29.B;Backstab Leeuwin!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN29.C;Refuse to aid Aloysius.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN30.A;The Duchy shall fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN31.T;A state of total war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN31.D;To our complete and utter dismay, those blasted Northlanders have completely betrayed the Geuzen cause and declared upon us, taking advantage of our current situation. The only thing that remains is to rally every able-bodied individual in our nation. We shall fight to the last man, even if it means that nothing will remain! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN31.A;Leeuwin shall prevail, no matter the consequences!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN32.T;A surprising turn of events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN32.D;With the war going in favor of the Duke of Africa's forces, the Leeuwin leadership saw no option but to ask their Geuzen brethren for help. To their dismay, and our bemusement, they have completely backstabbed them, and now Aloysius is facing a two-front war. Of course, the Northlanders must think that they are clever, but we are one step ahead. It is time to end the Geuzen menace completely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN32.A;Attack the Northlanders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN33.T;Cleaning up the Northlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN33.D;With Aloysius out of the picture, after our majestic victory against the rogue Geuzen state of Leeuwin, all that remains between us and complete control of the Cape, are the separated Northlander republics, New Flanders and Opstalia. These two republics, constantly locked in petty conflict, will be target of a swift campaign, which will surely be nothing for the Duke of Africa, who has led the Cape to victory time and time again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN33.A;The Cape will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.T;Strike the Northlander Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.D;With Aloysius out of the picture, after our majestic victory against the rogue Geuzen state of Leeuwin, all that remains between us and complete control of the Cape, is the Northlander Union. Having been constantly locked in petty conflict, the Northlander republics have become one, and have consolidated the northern Cape. The Cape will be united under the Duke, to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN34.A;The Duke will lead us to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.T;Conflict in the Mainland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.D;With the situation in the Burgundian heartland quickly descending into pure chaos, and the Parliamentary faction waging all out war against the loyalist forces of King Jean. The question of the Geuzen War hangs from a thread. What are we to do regarding the Duke of Africa's conflict against the Geuzen states? We could pull out from the conflict, which would essentially mean returning to the status quo, or continue with the war! This, however, with the situation in Burgundy growing more dire by the day, wouldn't be the wisest of decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.A;Order the Duke to pull out from the Geuzen States!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN35.B;Nonsense! We didn't invade the Geuzen for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN350.T;Peace with the Duchy of the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN37.A;A return to peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.T;Victory in the Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.D;Even with conflict consuming the mainland, The Duke of Africa, managed to prevail over his enemies. The forces loyal to the Duke now stood victorious over the rogue Geuzen states of the Cape, and the undisputed reign of the Duke of Africa stood unchallenged. With the Geuzen broken, and the Cape under the guiding hand of the Duke of Africa, the Geuzen War had ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN38.A;The Duke stands victorious, onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN39.T;The Nieje Hoop Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN39.D;With the First Geuzen War over, the Geuzen states find themselves at a crossroads, many think that with the era of Burgundian aggression over, it is finally time to seek the unification of the disparate Geuzen States. However, with the conflictive ideas of the different states, such a call to union can easily fail and break down. The Geuzen will have to put aside their differences, or face war once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAFN39.A;Call for Geuzen Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.T;Call to unification!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$, after the conflict with the Burgundians ended, has ambitions of unifying the Geuzen states, into one single entity! Of course, for this to go through, all of the Geuzen States need to accept, which, given the rebellious nature of our peoples, is unlikely. How will we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.A;The Geuzen will be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.B;Of course not! And give up our independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN40.C;Approve their decision! Move North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.T;Geuzen Winds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.D;With the Geuzen States setting their differences aside and agreeing to unification, all that remains is formally signing and formally merging the governments of the Republic. This signals a new era for the Geuzen, now united, nobody shall stand against them! Burgundy will tremble, and Batavia will never stand divided again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN41.A;For Batavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.T;The Neije Hoop War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.D;As some expected, negotiations between the Geuzen States, which were in the middle of talks regarding Geuzen unification into a single political entity, have broken down. Now, in a total state of war, the Geuzen states find themselves in a final conflict. Whoever stands victorious by the end, would claim the mantle of the sole Geuzen State, and unify them once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN42.A;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN44.D;In $YEAR$, Diamonds were found in Rijsseenfoort, nearing the Geuzen border with the Duchy of the Cape. Worry has sprung up, given the proximity of Rijsseenfoort to the Geuzen States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN45.D;Today, one of the many settlers of Rijsseenfoort appealed to the Parliament and pleaded to get support so he could start a prospecting and mining operation in Rijsseenfoort. This was inevitable as after the news of diamonds being found, there are countless proposals made everyday to the parliament about opening up exploitation of this newfound resource.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN45.A;All we have to do is say yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.T;Prospectors to Rijsseenfoort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.D;A team of prospectors and miners from near and far, as was promised to the Duke, have been assembled and are ready to head towards to the riverbanks of Rijsseenfoort, sluices and dregs in hand, to reap the pure wealth from the riverbanks!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN46.A;Good luck, prospectors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.T;Prospectors attacked in Rijsseenfoort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.D;Following the news of diamonds being found in Rijsseenfoort, our $MONARCHTITLE$ had become aware that the Burgundians had started operations and were trying to fully extract the precious metals. However, nothing could be done about it, as it was Ducal territory, and we sat in an uneasy peace with them. We had nothing to worry about, until news reached our $MONARCHTITLE$ that a group of rebellious Geus settlers near the border with Rijsseenfoort crossed over and completely slaughtered the prospectors, as they were "encroaching upon their rightful land". This will not end well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN47.A;Conflict is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.D;Those blasted Geuzen had done it again. When news reached the Cape, the duke was overtaken by a primal sense of fury and righteousness. The riverbanks had been painted with blood, as the innocent prospectors and miners laid massacred on the shores. The Geuzen, unprovoked, had intruded upon his sovereign lands and brutally attacked the prospectors leaving no survivors of the bloodshed that ensued. There was nothing left to be said, all that remained was to act. Ready the men, the mad dogs will be put down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN48.A;Thus it begins!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.T;Victory in the Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.D;Following the disastrous happenings in the Rijsseenfoort riverbanks, the forces loyal to the Duke of the Cape and Burgundy swiftly descended upon the Geuzen, with a fury never before seen. They wanted revenge for the senseless killings against innocents commited by the Geuzen, who had invaded the frontier and committed a bloodbath. Intended or not, the Geuzen weren't going to get away with their actions one more time. And they didn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN49.A;The dogs have been put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN50.T;Future of Batavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN50.D;Leuwin under the rule of the Governor-Militant Aloysuis van Afrika and his successors have united the three old Geus Republics in one state that controls nearly all of South Africa. Many wonder what the "van Afrika" will do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

333250.B;The fight for freedom must continue !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN51.T;The trekkers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN51.D;Following the Burgundian conquest of Kaapstat some Geus instead of fleeing to Leuuwin or staying under Burgundian domination decided to create their own communities in the North. They have agreed to integrate our growing state now that Burgundy is no longer under direct control of the Geus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333251.A;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN52.T;The future of South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN52.D;With South Africa finally in a state of seemingly permanent peace. It is now attracting colonists from Europe after promises of empty land and guaranteed peace have been heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
333252.A;May it last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.T;The Inevitable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.D;Having already kicked out the sneering Burgundian imperialist from our lands, who would dare exploit rightful Geuzen resources, the Geuzen states remained in a state of uneasy peace. It was obvious that this status quo was not going to last long, given the conflictive nature of the Geus Republics. All that was left was to prepare, and to stand ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN53.A;The Cape will be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.T;The Geuzen Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.D;The conflict had kicked off. All of the Geuzen States found themselves in a state of total war against each other. Only one of us shall stand victorious in the end, and surely it will be $COUNTRY$! Our $MONARCHTITLE$ will lead the country to total victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN54.A;The final showdown is at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.T;The Geus, United at last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.D;Following a glorious victory in the Geuzen Civil War, and due to the military genius and enlightened guidance of our $MONARCHTITLE$ during these trying times, $COUNTRY$ stands as the sole Geuzen State in the Cape. We are now in a position of power, and as the sole undisputed power of the Cape, greatness beckons! Long live Batavia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN55.A;Batavia Breathes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.T;Our Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.D;Vryland, having maintained its independence due to sheer luck at this point, found itself the target of Burgundian ambitions. With the Geuzen out of the way, very little stood between them and absolute domination over the Cape. Opposing Burgundian rule would be practically a death sentence, since we stand in no position to possibly defeat them in an armed conflict...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56.A;Bend to the Burgundians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN56:B;We shall defend our lands, even if it means certain death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.T;The Autonomous Duchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.D;The Duchy of the Cape has asked to be governed as an autonomous dominion within the empire. Given the conflictive nature of the region, we have various ways on how to proceed about doing this. We could follow through with the petition and set up an autonomous dominion operating out of the Cape, and including our Geuzen holdings in the region, or instead, should we find that the region isn't worth of being autonomous, we can always maintain direct control. However, this surely wouldn't be a popular decision within the populace of the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.A;Set up a dominion with the Geuzen territories included.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.B;Maintain direct control over the Cape, they aren't worthy of self-governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN57.C;Set up a dominion with the Geuzen territories included. For the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.T;The end of Vryland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.D;After being reduced to a mere vassal of the Burgundians, we have received news that they the removal of our autonomy is imminent. We would come to form an integral part of the new Duchy of South Africa, under strict Burgundian supervision. We can't do anything about this. This is the end of the Bastaards's freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.A;Vryland lies dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN58.B;For the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.T;The Great Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.D;The Baastard, disregarding the disagreements and setting aside their differences with the Geuzen settlers, had decided that they had enough of unending Burgundian oppression, sacking, and imperialism. The Cape had to be free of Burgundian claws, even if it means the complete destruction of the Geuzen States! Facing defeat after defeat, and humiliation after humiliation, the Geus are filled with a zeal and fury never before seen. They would fight to the last man, in one last ditch effort to purge the vile Burgundian plague from the Cape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN59.A;One last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.T;Whispers of Discontent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.D;The South African Duchy thought that finding itself free from Burgundian control would be perfect. But they wouldn't be right. Lacking Burgundian peacemaking and funding, every day more regions of the Duchy fall to the Geuzen and Vrylanders, who are the biggest dissenting group in the duchy. It would seem that secession is inevitable, and so is war. Perhaps this could've been averted if the Duke was wiser with his decisions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN60.A;What will become of us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.T;The Great Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.D;Following large-scale rebellions and demonstrations all across the Duchy of South Africa, the Duke knew that he had his days counted. Alas, he really was expecting the Vrylanders and Geuzen to rebel once again. Without foreign support, and without any real power of his own, what is he to do? Everything points to the end of the Burgundians in the Cape, with Geuzen and Vrylander numbers overwhelming. What will become of the Duke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN61.A;Is this the end of the Burgundian Cape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.T;Regarding South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.D;After the removal of the Monarchy from our realm, there are loose ends that need to be dealt with. One of such loose ends, is the Duke of Africa, who rules over his petty fiefdom in South Africa. The Duke has multiple times expressed his desire to wipe the Geuzen from the face of South Africa, citing Geuzen aggression, and other much more personal matters with Aloysius, the current (or former) dictator of Leeuwin and claimant to the Duchy of Africa. We can choose between tolerating the Duke, or compromise with the Geuzen by granting them control over our least vital holdings in South Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.A;Tolerate the Duke, let him do as he pleases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN62.B;Offer land concessions to the Geus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.T;An offer from the Burgundians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.D;After the fall of King Jean and the Burgundian monarchy as a whole, the Duke of Africa's grasp over the duchy is tenuous at best, with no support from the new Burgundian order, and Burgundy's desire to pacify and quench the Duke's ambition, we have been sent a proposal to compromise with the Burgundians, this would mean the removal of the Duke of Africa from the Duchy, and we would also obtain control of everything but Ville du Cap proper. While we could always compromise with the Burgundians, which would be best for the stability of the region, is the new regime any different from the one before? They're still Burgundians, after all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.A;Accept their offer, we are in no position to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN63.B;Accept an offer from the Burgundians? Outrageous. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.T;Refusal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.D;As some circles within our government expected, the Geus haven't gotten past their pride and have rejected our generous offer, which was meant to maintain peace in the region and remove any traces of the perfidious Duke of Africa, a blasted remnant of the old monarchy. It seems that we are in no position but to assist the Duke in his efforts, since the Geus' pride and short-sightedness have played against them once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN64.A;Is this war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN65.T;The First Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN65.D;After the downfall of the monarchy, the Duke of Africa was hanging from a tightrope, fearing a lack of support from the new regime, however, after a surprising turn of events, fate played in his favor and he had the support of the Burgundian heartland. So then, the Duke, emboldened by the newfound approval and assistance of the new regime, readied his troops, and started a long march towards Leeuwin. Ylnerdam would fall, and Aloysius would be finally struck down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN66.T;The Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN66.D;Generals have been gathered in $CAPITAL$ for an important and secret meeting. Over the table has been drawn a map of South Africa, divided between our state and the Burgundian colony. On it, our secret services have indicated the cities and villages most likely to help us in the liberation, and the weak points of the Burgundian forces on the border. Everything seems to be ready, and the chief of staff point out that there could be no better moment for this plan to work. Now the decision rests in the leader of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN68.D;We have several agents in the Northlander Republic, and one arrived yesterday to the Cape with documents of great importance according to his report. Paul Kruger as he is called, was a clerksman working at the ministry of war of the Republic, and he had heard about a great plan of a surprise attack against our colony. Securing the document, he laid fire to the building to avoid being caught and ended up in the Cape after a few days of travel. These plans show the audacity of the Northlanders, and the news has already stirred the jingoists at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN70.D;The burning of the ministry of war was no accident ! A spy from Burgundy, Paul Kruger, who had obtained a post at the ministry uncovered the plan for the insurrection and war that our leader decided to not put into action a few months ago. He stole the plan and set fire to the building to avoid being caught. Thanks to his treachery, the Burgundian high-command has prepared countermeasures to our operations and also has planned to attack us in retaliation. We must mobilize every man in the Republic to fight for our independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN70.A;We should have attacked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN71.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN71.D;Today the troops of the Northlander Union crossed the border with the Burgundian colony of the Cape, triggering the second Geuzen War with Burgundy. For weeks tensions had risen in the Geus communities of the Eastern Cape, and the Northern Geus were able to secure several critical provinces in the former Leeuwin before the invasion thanks to various networks of informants and rebels. Now their troops walk toward the Cape, and this war will decide the fate of the whole South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAFN72.T;The Second Geuzen War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAFN72.D;Burgundian troops have again crossed into Geus lands, this time for the last time according to Burgundian statements. Following the discovery of a plan of a sneak attack on their colony, officials in Anvers decided to end the independence of the Northlander Geus. This war will decide the fate of the Burgundian colony and the whole Geus people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Therefore, they are willing to trade away the region of Romandy as a personal union underneath the Dual Monarchy so long as we promise "eternal autonomy" for the inhabitants of Bourgogne. This treaty is only a net positive for us- so long as we maintain the provisions of the treaty and do not at any point change the status of the Bourgogne region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;

BRG01.T;The Kingdom of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG01.D;"A kingdom without reason, without culture, without purpose" - Louis XII, King of the Dual Monarchy. The Kingdom of Burgundy was created with the reorganization of the possessions of the Duke of Burgundy in the Congress of Arras. There, the Duke swore fealty to the French Crown, but the annexation of the latter by the English resulted in complete independence for the new-born Kingdom. Centuries would pass and Burgundy grew in strength and power as both the Holy Roman Empire and Dual Monarchy were unable to interrupt its rise in any reasonable way. The most recent event was that of the German Revolution (followed by the Great German War) in which liberal forces attempted to create a independent united Republic of Germany. The fury of these revolutionaries would shake the status quo in Burgundy and cause the creation of an autonomous "Duchy of the Rhine", little more than a puppet state. As Burgundy is no longer bound to the treaty that created this entity, it annexation seems imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Why should the lands of the Dutch be ruled by the Brabantians? Was the very point of the creation of a independent Netherlands to be ruled by the Dutch and not the Brabantians?

But today, she signed, or perhaps was forced to sign, a new and unprecedented constitution into law across the Burgundian lands: The overwhelmingly strengthened liberal faction of the Parliament has coerced the queen under the threat of “other means” to enshrine universal voting and the end of the slave trade across the realm, among other such radical reforms, which angered the political heir-apparent and Duke of Brabant Jean beyond reason. In a haphazardly written manifesto, he decried the nerve to pressure his grieving and sick mother into enforcing such ridiculous demands which threaten to tear apart the fabric of the proud Burgundian society. Unsurprisingly, this too caused outrage among the liberals as a politically active soon-to-be monarch is indeed a dire threat to their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Betrothed early to ensure the close links of the principality of Jülich inside the Burgundian kingdom, their couple was a happy one (a rare occurrence in royal families). Four sons were born of their union between 1810 and 1817 : Jean de Brabant, Charles-Joseph de Frise, Maximilien de Nevers and Philippe de Flandre. Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus V of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role, already reduced, has plummeted with most of the Royal powers taken by Parliament in her absence. While her father Joseph II still chose his own government, Anne prefers to pray and live a reclusive life, giving more and more powers to her heir Jean who is all but a Regent, in name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG5.D;The tacit accord between the Papacy and Anvers has been for decades that the Burgundians would not intervene in the elections of the archbishoprics in exchange for rewarding loyal and quiet clergymen instead of politicians in Cologne and Mayence. The election of the latest Primate of Germany had seen for example Karl von Wittelsbach-Zweibrücken elected, a conservative nobleman who pose no threat to Burgundian rule. But in Cologne, the Pope has recognized the election of Josephus von Elnere as archbishop. A popular figure in the Rhineland, he had taken part in his youth in the Frankfurt assembly before leaving it when they infringed on the rights of the Church. Escaping to the Rhineland, he has formed countless charities while preserving some of the spirit of the German revolution, notably in his sermon of accession in which he has praised the Constitution of the Duchy of the Rhine and Liberal ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside, reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour, and in the most devout circles, criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG7.T;The 1000th anniversary of the Treaties of Verdun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG7.D;The Crown Prince Jean has made a remarkable visit to Verdun at the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the treaty that saw the Carolingian empire split between the three sons of Louis the Pious. Jean, a conservative and jingoist character has cultivated for years a 'link' to Lothar, the kings of Burgundy seeing themselves as his heirs since the inception of the Kingdom. Among the various platitudes and strange comparisons that his speech included, one has caught the ears of Rhenish journalists : 'like in the days of Lothar, we now see men of the Church conspire to break down the state. As Hincmar advised Charles the Bald, we now see traitorous talks in the Catholic clergy, hoping to separate the lands of the Rhine from their rightful sovereign. Burgundy will not suffer the fate of the kingdom of Lothar, and this beautiful and mighty country shall stand once again united and strong'. These words caused an uproar in the Duchy of the Rhine but the Prince refused to renege on his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG8.T;The Union Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG8.D;The personal union of the Duchy of the Rhine has caused problems for years. Many Dutch capitalists fear to invest in this industrial land because of the fact that the local government could change legislation or raise new taxes, a right they were granted with the formation of the Duchy. Furthermore, conservative circles fear that agitators are given too much freedom there and the military wants to have direct control over the Rhine fortifications, the first line of defence of the Kingdom being shared with Rhenish troops that are widely distrusted by the General staff. There is thus a general will to act on the matter with a draft of a Union Act that would see the Rhenish people given the same rights as the rest of the people of the Kingdom with special articles protecting the Catholic faith while also ending the temporal powers of the high clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653008.A;One kingdom on the Left Bank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG9.T;Failure of the Act of Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG9.D;As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has vetoed the proposition, while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life. The Anvers Parliament could have forced the Bill, but they would have needed the assent of the sovereign for this. Anne then refused to intervene, fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom and reassured the Rhenish, angering many Parliamentarians and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653009.A;Best to not upset the course of things ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG10.T;The meeting of Cologne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG10.D;Rumors have come from Cologne that Von Elnere would have met with the Revolutionary leader Hanno Tauber. Heir of the German revolutionaries, the Burgundian state has suspected him of animating various conspiracies and liberal associations throughout the Rhineland but so far nothing conclusive has ever been uncovered. If this meeting has happened, this could mean a lot for the political situation in the Duchy, as both the Archbishops and Tauber could mobilize revolutionaries to free the Rhineland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653010.A;We must watch the Rhineland even closer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG11.T;The Rhineland Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG11.D;The worst fears of the Burgundian government have come true : the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen, in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state. The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them, only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside, to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists, all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of Burgundian imperialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653011.A;Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG12.T;Burgundians are coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG12.D;We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy! Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653012.A;Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG13.T;The Rhineland Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG13.D;The government of the Duchy of the Rhine has broken the Personal Union with the Burgundian kingdom, and the Archbishop of Cologne has taken advantage of this to rally the Rhenish people under his rule, granting a liberal constitution and encouraging revolutions in Germany. This has prompted the Burgundians to mobilize their men to retake what they consider their rightful lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653013.A;The Left Bank is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG14.T;Act of Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG14.D;The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union in $YEAR$. The various privileges, especially the ones related to the two archbishoprics were removed and the Burgundian police confiscated weapons all across the reoccupied lands. However the act also granted equal representation and voting rights to the people of Rhénanie along with a general amnesty for the revolutionaries that had taken arms, at the exception of the archbishop von Elnere who died in exile several years later. The act also saw the reaffirmation of the anti-slavery stance of the Burgundian kingdom and many Liberals saw it as the proof of the transition to a truly Liberal and Constitutional Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
653014.A;One kingdom, one law!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
BRG15.T;The end of the Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG15.D;The war against Jean united Republicans and Liberal Monarchists for a time but everyone knew that the issue of the form of the state would have to be resolved. Charles-Joseph de Frise, second son of Marie, is in Finland and has renegated his claims to the Burgundian throne which is a sad affair, as he would have been an excellent choice for all but the hardcore Republicans. Now Burgundy must choose between the continuation of the Monarchy with Maximilien de Hollande, third son of Marie, as a King devoid of power or declare the Republic. While Republicanism has surged because of the Civil War, the Republicans §Rare fiercely opposed by the nationalists§ who see them as Dutch and Jewish elements wanting to weaken Burgundy, and §Rthese groups would be ready to use force to crush the radicals.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG16.D;The war against Jean united Republicans and Liberal Monarchists for a time but everyone knew that the issue of the form of the state would have to be resolved. Charles-Joseph de Frise, second son of Marie, was the first choice of the Parliamentarians but he has been missing for years. Rumours say that he is retired in the Finnish wilderness, that he has been searching for the El Dorado in Amazonie or that he joined a Buddhist monastery in the Far East. With no proof of him still alive, the Regency has declared him officially dead and now Burgundy must choose between the continuation of the Monarchy with Maximilien de Nevers, third son of Marie, as a King devoid of power or declare the Republic. While Republicanism has surged because of the Civil War, the Republicans §Rare fiercely opposed by the nationalists§ who see them as Dutch and Jewish elements wanting to weaken Burgundy, and §Rthese groups would be ready to use force to crush the radicals.§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG17.T;The Burgundian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG17.D;Burgundy has suffered too much in the past years. Everyone thought that the Regency would have ended the period of unrest the country suffered but it only ended with more instability and bloodshed as nationalists and Republicans fought over the future of the country. The military had to step in and so they did : veterans from the Civil War took control of the capital and the major cities, ending the previous government. The coup was swift and well organised, with the General Schnaebelé proclaimed Protector of the Burgundian State. No more will Burgundians will fight one another because of politics: all will answer to the will of the Protector who will restore order and stability and glory to Burgundy and all its inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
653066.A;Dire situations require harsh solutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG18.T;Jean is Dying;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG18.D;Our King is 83 this year and he has become increasingly lethargic and now rarely leaves his bed. It appears everyone, even Jean, knows he is not long for this world. Since Jean's heir died during the civil war Jean's nephew, also named Jean, son of Queen Anne’s third son, Maximilian of Holland, is the next in line. Prince Jean has no experience in government and instead lives the life of a playboy with a different woman almost every night.  However, our King seems disinterested in preparing his nephew for taking over the throne and so far only interacts with his privy council, senior members of his military command, and interestingly his cousin, the German Duke of Berg, Guillaume de Jülich. Whatever Jean’s goals are it doesn’t seem like he has long to accomplish them and we must prepare for a Burgundy with Jean VI. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG18.A;What is Burgundy without Jean? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG19.T;The Death of Jean VI ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG19.D;“La Bourgogne, l'armée, Jean mon fils”, Last words of Jean VI\n\n Jean VI de Bouillon, King of Burgundy for over 44 years, has died today. Jean leaves a complex legacy behind in Burgundy. For some he is seen as a paternal figure who cared for his people and sought to make sure that all his subjects, no matter their position, could be held accountable. For others he is a tyrant who destroyed democracy in Burgundy and brought war and destruction never before seen onto Burgundy. The “Prime Minister”, the Chief of the army, Secretary of the Navy and weirdly Guillaume, Duke of Berg, acted as the pallbearers for Jean’s funeral with the heir apparent nowhere to be seen. Jean's nephew is set to become the new king of Burgundy and ascend to the throne as Jean VII. Until the new Jean is crowned The privy council will govern in his place as an interregnum council and they will soon gather to read Jean’s will execute any of the late king’s last wishes. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG19.A;The King is dead, long live the King ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG20.T;The Burgundian Succession Crisis ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG20.D;What should have been a simple succession has now turned into a crisis. In his will Jean VI has decreed that his cousin Guillaume, the German Duke of Berg, will be his successor. While Guillaume is the senior head of the house of Jülich, he has no blood connection to Queen Anne, related only by her husband, Jean-Maximilien. Jean's justification for this is that Guillaume is a loyal Jeanist and his ascension to the throne would help unify the "Frankish" people. To legalize this Jean has posthumously adopted Guillaume as his own son, and since Guillaume was already in the line of succession he technically is now the legal heir. This event has polarized almost all of Burgundy and there seems to be little support for Jean’s actions. There have been whispers that the military has even been in talks with former members of the old parliamentarism faction to try and restore the old constitution.The interregnum council itself has made it clear that they will follow Jean’s wishes and Guillaume will be the new King of Burgundy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG20.A;You can’t just change the family tree like that ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG21.T;A Night in Anvers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG21.D;As feared, elements of the military have moved against the interregnum council and seek the restoration of the old constitution. Units throughout the capital have begun organizing and marched upon Anvers Palace. However, right as the military arrived at the palace, Guillaume exited the building and stood in front of the soldiers. As units slowly filled in to witness this spectacle Guillaume gave a speech.\n\n “Soldiers, your king, my cous… father, Jean VI, gave much to his country, he gave us order, he gave us stability, and most importantly he gave us glory. If he were here today he would be ashamed that the same army that enshrined those virtues would dishonor itself by destroying them. I may not have fought with you, but I know you all did not risk your lives only to bring chaos to Burgundy. I ask you now if you wish to complete your goal, arrest me now, otherwise return to your barracks and together we will ensure Burgundy’s rightful place in the world as Jean ordained.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG21.A;The military disperses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG21.B;The military arrests Guillaume!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG22.T;The Anti-Socialist Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG22.D;With Guillaume's rule now secure and coronation officially completed, he has presented his first set of laws to be promulgated as King of Burgundy. Officially titled the “Moral and Anti-Coercion Labor Laws” these laws soon became better known as “The Anti-Socialist Laws”. These laws put an end to unpaid forced labor as well as make child labor illegal throughout the Kingdom. However, the laws also put forth punishments for those that would coerce workers into ideologies such as Socialism, or Blanquism. The definition of how one coerces another is left vague and could be interpreted as being a member of a socialist club, displaying socialist symbols, or even being suspected of having socialist tendencies. Already arrests are being made and entire prisons are filling up with people who are suspected of coercing others as co-workers turn on one another, friends accuse friends, and people speak out against their own family members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG22.A;The red flag will not fly here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG23.T;The Burgundian Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG23.D; With the coup successful, the constitution restored and Guillaume exiled back to his duchy, the matter of who should be King of Burgundy now remains. Jean, son of Queen Anne’s third son, Maximilien of Holland, is the obvious choice. He doesn't appear to have the authoritarian tendencies of his uncle and even then enough restrictions on royal power are now in place to keep him in check. However, we have also received news that a new claimant has appeared in Anvers. With a Finnish accent he calls himself Kaarle de Julich and claims he is the hereto unknown second son of Charles-Joseph, Queen Anne’s second son. He carries a letter that apparently bears Charles-Joseph signature and formally acknowledges Kaarle as his son. This dubious evidence would make him the senior claim to the throne, however Kaarle appears to be even more radical than Charles-Joseph and expounds socialist ideas which he says he plans to carry out as king. He could be the modern king we need, but can we take the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG23.A;Jean VII will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG23.B;Kaa- I mean, Charles III will be our king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG56.T;The Holland Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG56.D;Prince Maximilien de Hollande is a rather eccentric figure whose obsession with the medieval world and his string of lovers (rumored to be of both sexes) has brought him much notoriety. An introverted man, his appetite for scandalous affairs is matched only by his passion for Romanticism. Most of his money is spent commissioning new artworks or expanding his castles along grandiose lines. The prince owns multiple castles, but Muiden Castle (his current residence) near Amsterdam is his favorite. Today he sent word to the capital asking why new guards had been stationed there! It seems that he has no knowledge of any recent political developments. This has caused the latest in many waves of complaints by republicans against Maximilien, whom they see as the picture of royalist decadence. However, he also holds the strongest claim to the Burgundian throne, and thus is the leading candidate to be our new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG56.A;At least our artists shall not suffer under him…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG57.T;The Castle Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG57.D;King Maximilien's lavish, often hedonistic lifestyle was admirable and dignified to a few, and an eyesore amongst many. His luxurious "public works" projects all across the realm have gained criticism from the public and were covered by unregulated gossip publications alike. Unbeknownst to the Royal Court was an insider - a whistleblower exposing to an underground pro-republican publication a scandal of massive proportions, involving the renovation of old medieval castles such as the Boullion castle at Anvers and the Montjoie castle at Aachen. Furthermore, he too, unveiled the plans for the construction of a series of castles throughout the country, culminating in a grandiose "castle amongst castles" to be built in the capital of Anvers, with cost estimates of up to 2 million guilders. As the day passes the populace is continually riled up with the unfortunate economic situation slowly unreeling, with the public perception of the monarch reaching record lows. With our King unwilling to negotiate with such "philistines'', what shall we do lest the common folk do something folly?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG57.A;A few leaks to the press should help reduce the King’s funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG57.B;The monarchy must be protected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG570.T;The Great Namur Castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG570.D;King Maximilien’s vanity has hit new heights - figuratively and literally. Work has concluded on the enormous Great Namur Castle, which he regards as the crowning achievement of his life. Constructed in majestic Empire style, every inch of the ostentatious building was minutely planned by the King, and he treats it as though it was an extension of his own body. To his credit, the dizzying amount of laborers and provisioners required, along with medical staff to treat disease outbreaks among such a large workforce, entertainers to keep the workers happy, and police to intervene if such entertainment gets them a little too rowdy, has caused the surrounding area to transform from a large town to a full-fledged city in a matter of years. Yet the stupendous sums spent on the effort will not be forgotten by the republicans and socialists of Burgundy, whose loathing of Maximilien grows daily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG570.A;Please let this be the last one he builds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG58.T;Popular Outrage against Maximilian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG58.D;The headlines of the Daily Miller, the New Thinker and the New Burgundian have all turned on King Maximillian. All three papers are noted to be either republican or socialist in nature and have rallied together to denounce the King. This wave of antagonism has occurred due to Maximillian’s spending habits of large balls for the Nobility and other such things.\n\nAlthough indulged in peacetime, the peoples of Burgundy know that war is on the Horizon and that these spending habits must cease which they have not. Papers such as the Daily Miller, New thinker and New Burgundian have stoked the flames of discontent of the people into potential revolutionary idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG58.A;”Vive la République” is becoming quite common in Anvers…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG59.T;The Crown Prince Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG59.D;Ever since the Castle scandal, the press has scrutinized the royal family and especially the Crown Prince Jean, who is known to live a dissolute socialite life throughout Europe. However, his most recent conquest is a French catholic actress, an anathema to all true Burgundians hate. When confronted by the public on his relation with Catherine Bernard, Jean has refused to renegade her, and he now speaks openly of marrying her despite all conventions and state interests. Now the government has presented the Prince with an ultimatum : abandon the actress or be forced to abdicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG59.A;Jean agrees and prepares to leave with Catherine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG59.B;Jean abandons Catherine like so many before her ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG60.T;The Abdication of the Crown Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG60.D;”People of Burgundy, you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. You must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as Crown Prince as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. I now quit public affairs altogether and I lay down my burden. It may be some time before I return to my native land, but I shall always follow the fortunes of the Burgundian race and empire with profound interest.” - Jean de Hollande\nThe apparent heir to the Burgundian throne has fled the country to marry his love interest, throwing the country in chaos as the succession is now challenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG60.A;Always the romantic…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG61.T;Proclamation of the Burgundian Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG61.D;”A form of government which deeply troubled the country a score ago, is now espoused by its whole people. The events of the past few years have given us the Republic. It is our task that she shall exist legally as the only form of government of Burgundy.” -Adolphe Ligre, head of the Burgundian Parliament\nThe dream of the Republicans is now achieved : the monarchist compromise has erupted in pieces as the madness of the King is apparent to all and his succession challenged by the abdication of his only son. Maximilien has been escorted to leave the country and his properties seized by the Republic. In Anvers and most of the cities of the realm, huge crowds have erupted into joy, removing the Royal crest from the Burgundian tricolors and singing Republican songs in scenes of popular jubilation. The first act of the Assembly was to proclaim this day a national feast, before preparing for the work ahead. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG61.A;”Le républicain a pour amis\Toutes les bonnes gens du pays!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG62.T;The Crown is Gone : Long live the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
BRG62.D;Scores of Royal banners are being burnt in front of the former Royal Palace in Anvers whilst the people sing of revolution. The crown of Burgundy is now replaced with a presidential consulship. Armed revolution burns in the rest of the cities and countryside, whatever is left of Royalist troops and garrison’s now surrender to the revolutionary militias and guard units or flee the country itself.\n\nThe stint of feudalism, of Royalty and honour and the toiling of the masses to preserve the said honours of those born above in the social chain is now gone in Burgundy. Now a new dawn appears upon Burgundy : an era of Republicanism, of liberty and citizenship liberty. The King is gone, long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

PBG_the_great_castle_desc;The Great Namur Castle is a spectacle to behold, however its true benefit comes not from the castle, but its construction. In order to build this behemoth a massive public works project had to be created and a whole new town was essentially established to build the castle. This town has become a new industrial center with many new innovative and experimental techniques being used and developed which has since gone on to work on more projects besides the castle. This combined with the castle is slowly improving people’s perception of the government and the king as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG42.T;Success of the Lotharingian League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG42.D;The defeat of King Jean did not mean the end of his ideals. Aristocrats, countrymen and soldiers who were drawn to his conservatism and jingoism still maintained several Jeanist organisations in Burgundy over the years although they never posed a great threat to the regime. However it has changed in the past few years : Nicolas Léon, a disgruntled officer has created the 'Ligue Lotharingienne', a nationalist organisation hostile to Parliamentarism, pacifism and Socialism. A renowned orator, he has attracted Burgundian crowds and calling the Civil War the biggest mistake in the history of the country. A supporter of the Jeanist pretender in exile, although with his own outlook on how the country should be run, many reactionaries and also members of the armies have joined his party that will surely become a force to be reckoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG42.A;What is this new ideology ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG43.T;The Restoration coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG43.D;Burgundy lost its power over the years and the latest defeat was only the nail in the coffin. Seeing the opportunity, several high members of the general staff with links to the Ligue Lotharingienne have gathered in $CAPITAL$ and demanded power be handed to them. The leader of the Ligueurs was then invited to form a government with a policy program in 5 points : the restoration of the rightful King, the end of Parliamentary politics with a mandatory enlistment in the party-state, nationalisation of the 'traitor industries', refusal of the demilitarisation and a strong Burgundian state to lead its people to glory. Jean VIII was swiftly crowned although he held no true power like his grandfather had entertained some decades ago and acted as a puppet of the Ligue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

JEAN351.D;The civil war in Burgundy has come to an abrupt close due to the invasion by $COUNTRY$. Rather than take advantage of the royalists' sudden vulnerability, the parliamentarians have suffered an internal military coup. Its leaders, chiefly General Charles du Motier, a Protestant immigrant from the Midi, have arrested the civilian leadership and pledged to support "the legitimate king of Burgundy against all her foes". The public outcry at the quashing of the Estates-General has been lost in the sweep of xenophobic war fever against the invaders of Burgundy. Far from catching Burgundy in her greatest moment of weakness, we may very well have delivered the royalists victory on a silver platter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG1.D;The ruler of Namur has declared himself independent of the utterly broken rule of the Burgundian Crown and with that- Burgundy is officially dead.

BRG2.T;The Collapse of the Burgundian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG2.D;Burgundy has been rendered landlocked by the independence of the Netherlands and the conquest of all remaining European ports under their control. With this in mind and the decline of Burgundy as a whole, the Netherlands has decided to seize all colonial territories of the Burgundian Empire either through direct force or persuading colonial officials to support the new status quo. It would be a understatement to say that Europe is in shock at the sudden death of a major colonial empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653002.A;We should have expected this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG3.T;We are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG3.D;Since Burgundy no longer has effective control over our nation due to being landlocked and its direct colonial territory being seized by the Netherlands. We are independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

JEAN1000.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1000.D;The tensions have grown too important in the previous years leading to a popular revolution in Anvers and the Royal Family of Burgundy has been forced to flee abroad. The various contradictions of the old system have been swept away and it seems that Burgundy is now entering a new era of stability. Old feuds between the North and the South of the former kingdom seem to have been set aside to reach out their hands to guide the Burgundian Republic to its destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653095.A;Past the horizon shines a new light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1001.T;King Jean flees to Ameriga;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1001.D;The former King of Burgundy has fled to Ameriga! After a civil conflict in the until-recently unstable nation, the King's forces have been decisively defeated. There are, of course still many who believe in his vision for Burgundy, although for them his escape is a blow to their legitimacy. Although the future looks peaceful for Burgundy, the king himself has said that he is not yet done with politics, and shall look to any opportunity to reclaim his throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1001.A;He is gone, for now ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are, of course still many who believe in his vision for Burgundy, although for them his escape is a blow to their legitimacy. Although the future looks peaceful for Burgundy, the king himself has said that he is not yet done with politics, and shall look to any opportunity to reclaim his throne ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1002.A;He is gone, for now ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1.T;The death of Queen Anne;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN1.D;The queen of Burgundy, Anne II of Cleves-Valois-Bourgogne has died yesterday in her country mansion in Eupen. A devout and retired monarch, she was seen as a figure of unity by the population although not many truly loved her. As the funerary convoy passed through the cities of Central Burgundy to be buried in Anvers with her late husband many noticed that it was her last son, Philippe of Flanders that led the procession rather than her heir Jean. It was no secret that tensions and divisions marked the royal family, as the Queen resented the affirmed and oppposite personnalities of both the Reactionary heir and her Liberal second son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653020.A;At least she joins her beloved in their mausoleum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN2.T;The coronation of Jean VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN2.D;A few days after the official funeral of the late Queen, Anvers was preparing for the new coronation of the King. As the ritual dictates, the King enters Saint Michael's Abbey where the Archbishop of Anvers demands him an oath to protect the Realm, the Faith and cause Justice for his subjects. Following this, the King is annointed like the Kings of Israël. From this coronation emerged Jean VI of Burgundy, acclaimed by the crowds of Anvers. Foreign journalists witnessed some opposition to this joyous occasion, notably from Liberal students that were however soon disposed by the police before being able to disturb the procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653021.A;Dei Gratia Rex!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN3.T;The Adress to Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN3.D;The Sovereign of Burgundy opens and closes Parliament, and even the late Queen Anne did her duty although always following the advice of her Prime Minister. Jean VI however had a different mind on the royal function. As the members of the two Houses gathered to hear his speech, he proclaimed that he had sworn to protect the people of Burgundy and that he would take a more important role in politics compared to his mother. His will was not to infringe on the rights bestowed to his subjects by his predecessors but only to exert his rights and duties as King of Burgundy. While the members of Parliament applauded the speech as the custom dictated, the malaise felt by many was apparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653022.A;What does it mean for Burgundy ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN4.T;The Pinto affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN4.D;François de Pinto was a member of the East Indies Company who was in charge of lobbying members of Parliament in favor of the company. In $YEAR$ he became the centre of a mediatic affair as corruption of members of Parliament was revealed by the Conservative newspaper 'Le Temps'. This was a blow to the Liberals since most of the members that had received bribes through da Pinto were of their faction, and the number of laws protecting the interests of the Duch-based company provoked popular discontent throughout the Southern lands of Burgundy. As the son of a converted Jew, Da Pinto was a perfect target for the newspaper, and was soon forced to flee Burgundy because of the many threats he received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653023.A;The V.O.C must be reigned in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN5.T;The Anti-Corruption bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN5.D;Following the Pinto affair, Conservative members of the Upper House proposed a bill that aimed to reduce the lobbying towards members of Parliament. This move was not a disinterested one : the Upper House was filled with nobles who had ties to the industries and foreign trade but never were lobbied like the Member of the Lower House. It was soon clear to many that the law while proposed by the Upper House had been drafted by the King who intented to play a role in politics. Even though the popular opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill, the Lower house rejected it, declaring that current laws were sufficient to prevent another Pinto affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653024.A;What is this masquerade ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN6.T;The King's Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN6.D;After the failure of the anti-corruption bill, the King proposed a new bill on the subject. Despite concessions from his side, it was clear it would lose the vote. When the speaker called for the house to vote, hard knocking was heard on the door of the chamber, and when it opened, it was none other than the King himself, dressed in full regalia who entered the chamber. He demanded the speakers chair, from where he held the subsequent speech :;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653025.A;I can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN7.T;The King's Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN7.D;'It has become clear over the past couple of months that nobody in this entire institute that claims to represent the Burgundian people actually represents them. This Chamber houses nothing but the representatives of the interests of industrialists, merchants, of money and the destructive forces of modernism. If no single man here is willing to defend the common people of this kingdom from these interests, as you were willing to show again with the vote of this afternoon, duty falls upon the oldest institute of our kingdom to do what this chamber has failed to do. Is it not the institute of king that, bound by blood and rooted in our soil, represents our nation's past as her tradition, our nation's present as her voice and our nation's future as her hope ? It is because of this weight on my shoulders that I have decided to, in my due right as king, to dissolve the current session of Parliament until new elections have been called and a new parliament can take place in this chamber. Gentlemen, you're free to go home.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653026.A;What just happened ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN8.T;Beginning of the Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN8.D;Liberal members of Parliament were always critical of the erratic ways of the King but tolerated him for the sake of order and continuity. But with the intervention of Jean in the Parliamentary process and his wish to exert his royal powers he has become a threat to many in Burgundy. This feeling is not restricted to the men connected with the V.O.C but also true Liberals who openly question the legitimacy of a King who does not abide by the informal laws edicted by his predecessors. It seems that the growing divide between Jeannists and Parliamentarians only grows every day and could severely result in problems for Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653027.A;A new era of Burgundian politics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN80.T;Jeanist Coup in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN80.D;After a few street battles, Jeanists have won the power struggle in burgundy. The nation of Burgundy is, however, not politically united. Despite the Reiksflagge fluttering triumphantly over the nation, parlimentalists and liberals still sit, waiting for their chance to once again turn the fate of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6530270.A;At least it wasn't that bloody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN9.T;The State Language Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN9.D;Burgundy has been a pluricultural state for centuries with Dutch and German accepted in their territories while the Burgundian language, this hybrid Oil language, codified by the Royal Academy from Bourguignon, Wallon, Lorrain and countless Dutch and Flemish influences was always the primary language of the state. Now in these times of uncertainties, Germanophobia is again a powerful force in politics and a group of moderates (deputies who are not in the Royal or Parliamentarian faction) have pushed for a unified language act that would abolish the teaching and the use of German, Dutch and Frisian in Burgundian public institutions. While it has the support of the majority of the House whose members speak the purest Burgundian form of Anvers it could rekindle the fires of revolt in Rhineland. A radical faction has even proposed not to repel this act and maintain the status quo but to use this law to grant more language autonomy to the Germanic regions, as to ensure their loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.A;'Un Royaume, une langue';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.B;We do not need to change anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653028.C;Using their language won't change much, grant them autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN10.T;The trial of Johan von Bosse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN10.D;In the Pinto affair one deputy was largely attacked, the self-proclaimed Republican Johan van Bosse. A controversial figure in Burgundy throughout the years, he only avoided conviction by royal authorities because of his elections to the Chamber and the large popular support he enjoys in Bruges. But the various bribes he took from the V.O.C has eroded his position and he lost his seat in the latest election. Now he faces a trial that is very much piloted by the Monarchy as the judge is a renowned Jeannist partisan. What will happen to the Republican of Bruges ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653029.A;Van Bosse is freed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653029.B;Van Bosse is convicted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN11.T;The death of Philippe Rickwaert;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN11.D;For months, the duke of Ligny Saint-Pol, a close friend from King Jean had threatened journalists from the radical newspaper 'Le libre Luxembourgeois' to stop attacking the king. A prominent nobleman in Luxembourg and a vocal critic of the Burgundian Parliament, he soon became the new focus of Philippe Rickwaert, the owner of the paper who revealed the various affairs the duke entertained with women of little virtue throughout his various estates and properties. The duke challenged him to a duel, that Rickwaert refused, and then descended to Luxembourg where he shot the journalist to the death. This affair has rallied the radicals who have gathered in thousands for the burial of Rickwaert but the King can hardly let one of his supporters go in these times of need. The court packed with Parliamentarians (if one believes the Jeannist newspapers) has declared the duke guilty, but the King can still pardon him ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653030.A;The king will pardon his friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653030.B;The affair is too delicate, leave the judgement as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN12.T;The Walloon Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN12.D;In an interesting turn of events, a relatively minor law in the Burgundian Estates Generale, the law itself concering minor matters of Administration in Wallonian, has snowballed into a major crisis point for the Political system of our nation. What was once unthinkable has happened: the Estates Generale has stood against our King, demanding major concessions in the Wallonian region. Allowing the Estates to get away with this could soothe tensions in the nation, albeit giving administrative concessions in wallonia to the Parlimentarists, which could undermine our authority in the eyes of the people. If the King forced the Parliment to accept his demands, it could anger the people but give more political power to the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653031.A;The King allows the Estates Generale to have the concessions ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653031.B;The King forces the Estates Gernerale to accept his will ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN13.T;The Arsenal of the Burgundian Navy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN13.D;The port of Anvers is the main port of the Kingdom, and one of the biggest and more active in the world. The development of the capital has increased the problem of silting and many fear that the works needed to maintain the military port and prevent problems in the Escaut would be too much to pay. Rotterdam on the other hand poses no such problem, and is directly linked to the Rhine, the main artery of commerce of Burgundy. Thus the Parliament has envisioned to transfer much of the military facilities away from Anvers to Rotterdam, causing uproar in the capital as the arsenal is one of the biggest employers of the city. The King profited from this to take the defence of the capital, and this subject has become another divide between the Royals and the Parliamentarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653032.A;Rotterdam is best for the long term interests of Burgundy, do not listen to the rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653032.B;The King vetoes the law : the Navy stays in Anvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN14.T;De Broglie;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN14.D;Lately, the removed-cousin of the King, Antoine de Broglie has gotten the ear of the King. A ranked general in the Army, he also is seen as a capable administrator leading the Parti Royaliste in the Upper House. Since the times of Joseph II (1790-1817), the Prime Minister has always come from the winner party in elections but nothing legally forces the King to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653033.A;De Broglie will form a government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653033.B;We must not upset the unwritten laws of the Kingdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN15.T;The Abdication Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN15.D;The conflict between Jean and the Parliament has reached its breaking point. After years of divide between the Monarchy and the deputies, the Lower House has expelled the Royalists from the Chamber and declared the Crown vacant. Following this seditious act, the King mobilized the Army to disperse and arrest its leaders. Now the whole city-and the world wait for what happens next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653034.A;What will happen for Burgundy ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN150.T;The Short Estates-General;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
JEAN150.D;The Short Estates-General, or the Estates-General of $YEAR$, is a term describing the brief session of the Burgundian Estates-General in $YEAR$ which was abruptly ended due to attempts by the Parliamentarians to destroy the Royalist bloc. After years of animosity between monarchists and liberals, the latter attempted to censure and expel all members who had advocated for the end of constitutional rule within the recent past. While technically legal this measure was instantly blocked by the Royalist majority. The royalists then called upon the King to arrest the Parliamentarians for treason, alleging that they had been seeking to abolish the monarchy. Evidence of this "conspiracy" remains scarce but the Royal Army duly acted, placing not just the liberal leaders but indeed all non-royalists under arrest and charging them with whatever offenses the Crown could muster. Whatever happens to Burgundy now it seems clear that the Estates-General shall be at most an observer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN150.A;I love democracy. I love the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN16.T;Parliamentarian victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN16.D;The reign of King Jean ended the day the Lower House declared against him. The troops mobilized to deal with the unrest joined the rebels. The leader of the House led the force against the Royal Palace, where Jean was forced to sign his act of abdication. He was then ordered to leave his former Kingdom with his family while the Parliament assumed control of the government. The banished King could have fought but his will had been broken this day and he always refused to support the Jeannist organisations calling for his return. He would die from a heart attack 6 years later in exile, his famous last words being : 'My country did not deserve my reign'. Meanwhile in Anvers, Liberalism thrived as the main force of Reaction had been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653035.A;A new era for Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN17.T;The return of the old Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN17.D;The orders of King Jean were swiftly executed as the troops circled the House and threatened to open fire if the traitors did not surrender. While some uprisings started in the capital, the police was able to take care of them and the Parliamentarians had to face the truth : no one would come to help them and their gambit had failed. Most surrendered, some fled, and the most radicals tried to resist only for their blood to be spilled in the Chamber. Amnisty followed for some survivors as others were thrown into jail or banished. With no resistance to oppose him, the King was able to reassert his power, controlling the government and repressing Liberals and Socialists that dared to criticize him. Nevertheless Burgundy entered a period of stability and order, built on the blood of the deputies and the liberties taken away from the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653036.A;'Je l'ay emprins';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN18.T;Crisis in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN18.D;The orders of the King were only partially executed. The Parliamentarians could count on the help of some popular rebels that diverted troops away from the Parliament and the defection of the leading general who refused to open fire on the representatives of the people. The Parliament could not threaten the domination of the King over Anvers so they fled North. Instability followed as cities erupted in riots between Monarchists and Republicans throughout the Kingdom and especially the Netherlands. Now the spectre of war looms over the Burgundian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653037.A;A house divided cannot stand ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN19.T;The Utrecht Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN19.D;The Anvers Parliamentarians fled to Utrecht which opened her doors to them. From there the remaining Liberals, from Monarchists to Radical Republicans gathered to declare King Jean to be an usurper because of his violation of the will of the people. They called on all the true Patriots to join them to end his tyrannous reign, sponsoring revolts throughout the South. Now war is sure to come in Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653038.A;True Burgundy is where our King is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653038.B;True Burgundy is in Utrecht! (PLAY AS PBG);;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN20.T;Wallonia Defects to the Parlimentarians ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN20.D;As a direct result of the Wallonian Crisis, the Wallonian regional administration, that was granted to the Parlimentarians as a concession by King Jean, has allowed the region to defect from the Jeanists to the Parlimentarian cause ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653039.A;Damn traitors! We should have never given the Parlimentarians an inch! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN21.T;Wallonia Stays loyal to the Crown ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN21.D;Despite the recent Wallonia Crisis, Wallonia has stayed loyal to the Jeanist cause. Despite the political crisis that resulted over the region, the people themselves have stayed loyal to Crown and Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653040.A;An excellent lesson: never negotiate with your enemies! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN22.T;Luxembourg joins the Parliamentarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN22.D;The judgement against the Duke of Ligny Saint-Pol has emboldened the radicals in Luxembourg who have organized against King Jean for months. The newspaper founded by Rickwaert has been used as the herald of the revolution, with several issues calling on the men and women from Luxembourg to join their brethren against tyranny. The various authorities loyal to the Crown have been swept aside and the region is lost for the Jeannist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653041.A;We will prevail despite these traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN23.T;All is calm in Luxembourg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN23.D;The duke of Ligny may be an unsavory man for multiple reasons but he is a strong support of the Crown. Upon hearing the news of the Parliamentarian secession, he left his quiet isolation from his estates to rally the various people from Luxembourg who were in his debt. With his quick actions and his network the Radicalists in the area were quickly defeated and order restored in the area. The only great loss was a the 'accidental burning' of the newspaper founded by Philippe Rickwaert during the repression of a riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653042.A;A good man after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN24.T;Secession of Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN24.D;The riots inspired by the Parliamentarians following the abdication bill only grew worse after a few days. As the King fled South to organize the coming war, the local forces were quickly swept away and the whole province declared for the Parliamentarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653043.A;What has the city of the kings done ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN25.T;Restoration of order in Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN25.D;The riots inspired by the Parliamentarians following the abdication bill only grew worse in the aftermath. But even with the King fleeing south, the police and army still present in Anvers could count on the support of many port workers who remembered the Veto of the King over the relocation of the arsenal. With a few ships still present in the harbour, the whole city was soon under control and the rest of the province as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653044.A;God protects Brabant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN26.T;Flanders joins the Parliamentarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN26.D;Johan van Bosse, the former deputy of Bruges that escaped conviction for corruption took advantage of the situation to regain his popularity by attacking the King and rallying various Liberals to join the Utrecht government. Now all Flanders stand against the rightful King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653045.A;Damn this Republican!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN27.T;Insurrection quelled in Bruges;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN27.D;The actions we took, notably by convicting the Republican Van Bosse to jail had a result on the local political scene. Liberals were weakened and the local authorities have managed to quell the few rebels that rose anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653046.A;Flanders recognize its rightful King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN28.T;Picardie secedes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN28.D;The combats between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists turned to the advantage of the former, who successfully took Arras and the other towns, with the Royal garrisons swept away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653047.A;They will see our wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN29.T;De Broglie's actions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN29.D;A candidate for becoming Prime Minister a few years ago, De Broglie went back to the army following the refusal of the King to appoint him. He was garrisoned in Calais, overseeing the Channel and drilling his troops as methodically as possible. His presence was vital to the defeat of the revolutionaries in the province as he quickly dispersed the crowds in Arras with the help of his regiments. One can only wonder what would have happened if he had not been there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653048.A;Calais is safe and it's the most important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN30.T;Rhineland joins the rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN30.D;Rhineland was already before all this a bastion of Liberalism, and the defeat of the Cologne Revolution did not change that because of the lenient policy Burgundy held afterwards. Nevertheless it felt natural to many that the Rhineland would join with the revolutionaries, and the King expressed no surprise when the flag of the rebellion was hailed throughout the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653049.A;We defeated them back in 1848, we can do it now as well !;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN31.T;Rhineland supports Jean;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN31.D;Surprisingly, the areas of the former Duchy of the Rhine have stayed loyal to the Crown. Particularly important was the support of the deputy Christoph Kolbe, promoter of the Autonomous Language Act and a strong Jeannist supporter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653050.A;Well it was unexpected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN32.T;A fight to the death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN32.D;As the time for combat grows nearer the situation of the Crown appears dire, with most territories in Flanders and Wallonia in control of the revolutionaries. This state has galvanized the Jeannist, who will now fight to the death for the King and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653051.A;It's always darker before dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN33.T;A fight to the death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN33.D;As the time for combat grows nearer the situation of the Parliament appears dire, with most territories in Flanders and Wallonia in control of the Monarchists. This state has galvanized the revolutionaries, who will now fight to the death for Liberty and democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653052.A;It's always darker before dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN34.T;Strong Jeannism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN34.D;It may have given us enemies, but the Crown has always stood firm in its fight against corrupt Parliamentarians, making sure that our followers know we are the rightful cause and the most coherent one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653053.A;For God and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN35.T;Strong Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN35.D;It may not have allowed us to secure all territories in the south, but the Parliament was always stronger than the King and opposed his will. This has cemented our cause, who is widely seen as meaningful and right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653054.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN36.T;The Burgundian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN36.D;Opposition between King Jean and the Parliament of the Kingdom has seen the various territories take a side in the previous weeks between the Royalist government in the South and the Parliamentarians in Utrecht. Now the lines are drawn, loyalties are secured and both camps will fight for the future of Burgundy. King Jean declared war on the rebels, beginning his 'march on Utrecht' and now it can only end in the victory of one side over the other, or the death of Burgundy as the world has known it for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653055.A;Who could have thought that it would end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN37.T;The Second Rhine Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN37.D;As war erupted between the Monarchists and Parliamentarians- Rhenish radicals have successfully rekindled the flame of the First Rhine Revolution and caused the region  to explode into yet another revolution. Exiles from 1848, along with countless youngmen from Germany have flooded back to the Republic to take up arms against the Burgundian Tyranny. The guns would fall silent soon after the region had been secured though, as unlike the First Rhine Revolution, the chaos of the Burgundian Civil War has resulted in a complete impossibility for Jean or Anvers to take back the Rhineland. At least for now..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653056.A;$COUNTRY$ will return to the Rhineland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN38.T;Trouble in Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN38.D;Brabantian radicals are an important part of our war-coalition, and our control over most of the region has reinforced their cause. Sadly many are staunch Republicans that are not content with the state of our revolution, asking for a Republican proclamation. These divisions have in the last days become dire as the Brabantian republican leader Richard de Craene has gone back to Anvers, leaving the Utrecht assembly. It is hard to believe he will take action that could threaten the Revolution but Brabant could revolt against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653057.A;It would be a suicide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN39.T;The Brabantian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN39.D;Our fears were true. De Craene has levied the Brabantian flag in Anvers calling for an end of Burgundy and an independent democratic Netherlands. His call has been heard in all Brabant and also Friesland, where the Frisian have also declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653058.A;We must win at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN40.T;Victory of the Parliamentarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN40.D;The Civil War has finally ended : the Parliament of Utrecht and their supporters finally toppled King Jean and secured the southern parts of the country. King Jean has been banished from the country with many of its followers. Many challenges await the new Burgundy : the Liberal coalition that held during the war could break now over the status of the state, many moderates wanting to crown another King to the disgust of many Dutch republicans. But anyway for now, Jeannism as a political force has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653059.A;For the people of Burgundy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN41.T;Victory of the Burgundian Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN41.D;After months of fighting, the Burgundian civil war has now ended as the Parliament of Utrecht has submitted in front of the King and his armies. Burgundy is now reunited under her rightful monarch that will ensure that the country will never bow down to others. Repression is harsh, as most of the leading Liberal figures are banished or sent to prison for treason. The new Parliament convoked by the King is mainly filled by loyal men who will not do any thing to provoke the wrath of the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

JEAN42.T;Imminent Catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN42.D;We had received word that King Jean had suffered a stroke, leaving him barely conscious and throwing the Royalists into chaos. This led them to seek an armistice with us, and after a series of bitter debates amongst our coalition’s leaders, it was accepted. Yet this has torn Burgundy in two, and now our coalition is collapsing, as many generals accuse the civilian leadership of stabbing them in the back and permitting the indefinite division of our homeland. Several generals stationed in the Netherlands and the Rhineland are believed to be plotting against the government. We could attempt to stop them by arresting suspected traitors, chiefly General Armand Petain, who has always been critical of the civilian leadership. Assuming that our troops are still loyal to Parliament…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653061.A;The Utrecht Parliament is seized by General Petain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653061.B;Petain and his cabal are arrested, but Burgundy is divided…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN420.T;Anarchy in Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN420.D;The Civil War ended indecisively as King Jean suffered a stroke that cut the leadership of the Royalist cause, forcing them to seek an armistice. The Parliamentarians agreed, to the outrage of their generals, who accused the civilian leadership of stabbing Burgundy in the back. General Armand Petain, a fierce republican who had repeatedly criticized the Utrecht government’s political moderation, led a coup d’etat in an attempt to restart the war. Instead Burgundy shattered into pieces, with officers and Parliamentarians across the nation opting to declare their own states rather than obey the putschist general. A regency for King Jean based in Lorraine will continue, but northern and western Burgundy has seen the emergence of independent states with uncertain loyalties. It is the end of 500 years of Burgundy existing in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6530610.A;Everything has an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN43.T;The Brabantian Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN43.D;Unexpectedly, the Brabantian revolution forced both the Parliamentarians and the Monarchists to recognize their independent government. This has broken the unity of the Monarchists who must now recognize a new state in the North, with various regions declaring independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653062.A;The end of the Burgundian dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN44.T;The Namur Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
JEAN44.D;In the city of Namur the Parliament meet to inaugurated a new constitution proclaiming the virtues and principles of the self-determination of the Burgundian People. This new constitution retains the position of Monarch however the position is currently vacant pending the decision of the newly empowered Parliament. However, most of the powers once held by the king have been giving to the elected members of Parliament. Parliament now controls the power to raise taxes, make and enforce laws, conduct diplomacy appoint the Judiciary and otherwise govern Burgundy. In speeches given outside the city hall of Namur, where Parliament has been operating, the Prime minster and other Liberal leaders expressed their commitment to the new constitutional order and to preserving the rights of the Burgundian people.  With the implementation of the Namur constitution there is a hope that instability in the Kingdom will be brought to an end and the Burgundy can advance liberal values throughout Europe though deed and example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653063.A;For Liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
JEAN45.T;The Bouillon proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN45.D;'Now, therefore, We, out of Our Royal Will and Authority, do hereby declare and announce that as from the date of this Our Royal Proclamation Our House and Family shall be styled and known as the House and Family of Bouillon, and that all the descendants in the male line of Our said Mother Queen Anne who are subjects of these Realms, other than female descendants who may marry or may have married, shall bear the said Name of Bouillon....' \n\n The Burgundian royal family has been a target of Germanophobia because of their Rhenish origins. To dispel any attacks, King Jean has decided in a surprising move to legally change the name of the royal family in honour the town of Bouillon, where he has acquired a castle in remembrance of the hero of the First Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653100.A;Of all the names he chose ... Bouillon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN46.T;The First Jeanist Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN46.D;Loyalists and Royalist politicians and personalities have gathered in the Royal Opera House of Anvers to hold a conference on ever-growing threat of Socialism. To the shock of European journalists, the war-bent and reactionary kingdom is once again on the verge of a gradual rejuvenation towards a more uniquely reactionary bent: of Paternalism. A group calling themselves Jeanists, veterans of the civil war and Burgundian youth from all walks of life,  brimming with their fanaticism of Jean VI and Burgundian supremacy in Europe and their desire to combat the spectre of Blanquism  have gathered in Anvers to discuss their proposal with the King: the wondrous ideology of Jeanism. Jean VI while seated at the House, after being deeply invested and swayed by the Jeanists' speeches and even bouts of flattery, was reported to have "extremely grinned in joy, like a jolly kid awaiting his candy", as reported from pundits in Paris, and declared his immediate interest in appointing their kind to positions in government, with some talks of a new Royal Council composed of an overwhelming majority of Jeanist officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG440.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRG440.D;Angry mobs have done what the Burgundian Parliamentarians could not, end the rule of the Jeanists. Angry citizens have stormed the palace in Anvers dragged the King of Burgundy from his home and paraded him through the streets. A new Burgundian Republic has been proclaimed and the old constitution of Namur, long rejected and suppressed by the Jeanists, has been ratified by the mob and proclaimed as the law of the land. Let us hope that this newest change to long suffering Burgundy will be for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653109.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG44.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRG44.D;Burgundy has lost the Netherlands. As the head of this national humiliation, the royal palace was overrun by a mob led by several Republican leaders, and following a relatively bloodless Republican coup a provisional Republic has been set up in Burgundy. This is a great blow to the Burgundian effort, and one that Burgundy may not recover from for a long time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653110.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG45.T;The End of the Burgundian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRG45.D;In the Anglo-Burgundian war, a result of decades of animosity and sabre-rattling, Burgundy has been totally defeated by the Anglois state. The Staatsvlag has been lowered at the Anvers Parliament for the last time, the King has fled the country and any remaining Jeanists have faded into immediate obscurity. In the shadow of this defeat, a coup took place which installed a parliamentary republic in Burgundy. The centuries-old balance of power in Western Europe has been broken, and will likely not return to stability for a long time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653111.A;A new era comes to Burgundy ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JEAN400.T;Jean's Government Collapses ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN400.D;It appears even the Royalist south can no longer stand the authoritarianism of the Tyrant King. The burdens the King has placed on his remaining subjects, the mass conscription, the suspension of Habeas Corpus, and the arbitrary confiscation of people?s property for the war have completely alienated Jean in all aspects of society. The people have finally risen up against Jean and have overpowered the armies that remained loyal to him. They proceeded to overthrow Jean's illegitimate government in Nancy, however they could not capture Jean the Usurper who appeared to have fled Burgundy entirely. The new government now submits themselves before us, not wishing to continue the bloodshed caused by Jean's war. The end of the civil war is finally here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN400.A;Sic Semper Tyrannis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN410.T;The Parliamentarian Government Collapses ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JEAN410.D;Corruption has always plagued the governments of the world and the Estates General of Burgundy are no exception. In many ways the corruption throughout the government of Burgundy and Jean's adherent anti-corruption stance is what has caused this Civil War. It was hoped that the people would support the Estates General in the war in order to protect the rightful government from Jean's increasing authoritarianism. However, the corruption of the Estates General has become too much to bear and Jean's agents have been able to stage a rebellion that has captured the Estates General. With the central government gone and no other succession plans in place the Parliamentarian faction has surrendered and Jeans forces have retaken control of all of Northern Burgundy. With this The end of the civil war is finally here;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

rhone_dispatch_title;The Plombières Dispatch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rhone_dispatch_desc;For many years the Burgundian monarchy has kept in contact with several important figures in Occitania like the Bourbon family as to ensure their success in claiming the Arles kingdom and a Mediterranean port. Recently, the Anglois have grown resentful of these meetings and it seems that it could be easy to engineer a diplomatic incident while the King is in the bath town of Plombières and make Paris take an aggressive stance in this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG46.T;The ‘Arras Plans’;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG46.D;King Jean of Burgundy was visiting the bath town of Plombières in Lorraine when the Anglois general Louis de Bourbon-Bellegarde announced his defection to Burgundy and brought with him the so-called Arras Plans. According to this military intelligence, the Anglois army had been preparing an aggressive attack for years following the Burgundian Civil War, wanting to strike as soon as possible to dismantle the Burgundian monarchy. Or so the Plans said, as many believe them to be authentic. The King and his government denounced the Parisian endeavors and sent ambassadors for the Western European countries to form a resistance league against Anglois imperialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653112.A;And so the plot begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG47.T;Anglois Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG47.D;The reveal of Anglois military intelligence by the general Bourbon-Bellegarde has shaken the continent. Many had believed that Paris would abstain from reckless behaviour given how King Jean has acted in the recent years but these plans defy all previous assumptions. It seems to many officials that we must help Burgundy against the coming Anglois aggression or at least abstain from helping the Anglois aggressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653113.A;We stand with Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653113.B;These documents look shady to me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG48.T;The Bourbon-Bellegarde treason;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG48.D;The general of Bourbon-Bellegarde has defected to Burgundy, citing our oppression of Occitania as a stain upon his honor. He then publicly revealed to the press the ‘Arras Plans’, a series of military intelligence documents that paint our government as warmongering and ready to strike as soon as possible against the Burgundian threat. While it is true that we had been preparing for war against Burgundy, these Arras Plans are fake according to our high-staff. Nevertheless, the crowds demand a reaction and we have asked Burgundy to deliver the traitor to us or face consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653115.A;Does this mean war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG49.T;End of ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG49.D;Our demands have not been met by Burgundy who has been mobilizing and citing our army movements to prove the reality of the Arras Plans. Meanwhile the general population demands war with several demonstrations in the streets and plenty of critiques within the Estates-General from the opposition and members of our own party. And so we go to war as aggressors, but our might is enough to vanquish the Burgundians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653116.A;To Anvers lads !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG50.T;The Treaty of Fontainebleau;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG50.D;The Anglois armies have been defeated by Burgundy who now stands as the strongest power of Western Europe. Signed in the old royal castle of Fontainebleau, the treaty sees Burgundy gain the old Kingdom of Arles, part of the Burgundian Crown according to the Nationalists while extracting several other compensations from $THISCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653117.A;That peace can’t last !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG52.T;The Treaty of Neuchatel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG52.D;Burgundian machinations and plots have backfired as the Anglois armies marched through Bourgogne and Flanders and defeated the veterans from the Civil War. Now the war has ended and Burgundy is forced to let go of Bourgogne and Calais, old territories claimed by the King of France and England since the XVIth century. Moreover, the responsibility of war goes to Burgundy as Bourbon-Bellegarde acknowledged being part of a malevolent plot that would have seen crowned grand-duke of Toulouse should the Burgundians have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
653119.A;That peace won’t last…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG54.T;End of the Anglois-Burgundian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG54.D;Guns went silent in Western Europe as the Burgundian and Anglois leaders accepted peace. Neither side was able to win during the war that saw thousands die only for the glory of their respective nations. A sense of disgust and anger is felt in the streets of Paris and Anvers as nationalists of both sides have grown to see the existence of the other country as a threat to their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PBG_alliance_with_ARI_desc;The Kingdom of Aragon has been a traditional and loyal ally of Burgundy throughout their common history and the rapid expansion of the Crown of Aragon to include a restored Italian Kingdom was the culmination of their ongoing effort. This undeniably shocked Paris which cower in fear as their Mediterranean naval dominance and hegemony over the Provençal people of their South is actively threatened for the first time since the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614). While this new union surely offset the balance of power of Europe, it has been a boon to our geopolitical efforts to isolate the Anglo-French threat, and an alliance of friendship would most definitely further secure our respective place in Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PBG_alliance_with_OCC_desc;The history of interactions between the modern Provençal and Burgundians is intricate and complex, though it has always been a history of friendship and mutual trust: Burgundy tried to protect the independence of the County of Foix and Béarn in 1516, was an ally of Valois Provence during the Languedoc War (1532), and protected the rights of the Protestants of Occitania against the Anglo-French aggressor during the Wars of Religion (1598-1614), and finally during the Anglo-French Wars of Succession (1768-1771).

BRG25.T;The Frisian National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG25.D;The government’s neglect of the northeastern Netherlands during the Hollowing has resulted in unforeseen consequences. Furthermore while the northeast was once both economically prosperous and relatively autonomous (to the point of “Frisian freedom” being a well-known expression to describe the unique lack of serfdom and feudalism in the region’s past), it has lost both qualities due to the centralization of Anvers and the impact of the Great German War and the Hollowing.  Many in the region no longer see themselves as Burgundians, but instead as a separate, more German people. They are animated by the suffering of their cultural kin, a sentiment fueled by the rediscovery of old works in their own language, and the desire to protect that language from Burgundian hegemony. Now - and perhaps forever - they declare themselves to be Frisians, and that Frisia is a natural part of Germany. §RIf we ever find ourselves at war with a pan-German government, the Frisians may betray us to assist them.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG29.D;The Rhenish Germans have not forgotten that, when they were in the deadly grip of the Hollowing, Burgundy did not commit to saving them. For a time German nationalism had been submerged amongst the peoples of the Rhine in favor of religious and economic tensions amongst themselves. Now, however, a new generation of German nationalists are coming to the fore across the Rhenish confederation, those whose lost parents and grandparents in the Hollowing. In coffee shops and universities, in markets and factories, there are whispers in the dark against Burgundy and her presence in the Rhine. Above all is a commitment to the Rhine’s German character, and to upholding that quality against any attempt to erode it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG30.D;German nationalism within the Rhenish lands continues to grow, and now its supporters have begun to organize together. The Council of the Rhine, inspired by the German Councils organized by the Danubians, has recently concluded in the city of Cologne. This meeting drew pan-German nationalists from both the left and right banks of the Rhine, with unprecedented cooperation between Catholics and Protestants. The Council’s resolutions stressed the need for Protestant and Catholic Rhenish Germans to join forces and avoid the sectarian divisions of the past, and declared the “eternal and undiminished German nature of the Rhine and its people.” This event has greatly alarmed our foreign office, as rallying support from Rhenish Protestants against the Catholics has been the foundation of our eastern policy. §RIt is now possible that the whole Rhenish union could turn against us if we ever find ourselves at war with a pan-German government.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG420.T;Formation of the Ligue Lotharingienne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRG420.D;The defeat of “Jeanisme” did not mean the end of its popularity. Aristocrats, industrialists, and military men drawn to his conservatism and jingoism maintained several Jeanist organizations in Burgundy, though most were too small to note. However the situation has now changed : Nicolas Léon, a disgruntled officer, has created the “Ligue Lotharingienne,” a nationalist organization hostile to parliamentarism, pacifism, and socialism. A renowned orator, he has attracted crowds across the nation and called the ousting of the Paternalists “the most severe error in our national history”, one which he blames on a vast “Judeo-Blanquist conspiracy” against “the pure Frankish race.” Leon supports the Jeanist pretender in exile, but he has his own outlook on how the country should be run. Many reactionaries and members of the armed forces have joined either the Ligue or its paramilitary, the brownshirted Paladin Force, named for Charlemagne’s legendary knights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRG421.D;”Our program is simple : We want Guillaume III to rule Burgundy.” - Ligue Lotharingienne leader Nicolas Léon\n\nRumors of the government preparing to arrest Léon and his inner circle prompted the Ligue to strike first. After several high-profile brawls between the Ligue’s paramilitary, the Paladin Force, and their Blanquist enemies, Leon declared his intention to march on $CAPITAL$. His followers then marched through key cities across Burgundy before converging on $CAPITAL$, where Leon presented his demands : the crowning of Duke Guillaume III of Berg as King, the end of parliamentary politics, nationalization of “traitor industries,” militarization, and state centralization. The opposition has begged the Head of State to declare a state of siege and issue a new democratic constitution, while anti-Ligueists within the army have threatened to take action on their own.

BRG490.T;The Louvre Palace Has Been Reduced To Cinders;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG490.D;Reports have emerged from Burgundian occupied Paris of the burning of the Louvre Palace. The Louvre Palace has served as the main French residence of our monarchs for over 400 years following the ascension of the Plantagenêts to the French throne in place of the old French royal residence, the Hôtel Saint-Pol. The Louvre Palace was further expanded by Édouard IV to signify the revitalization of France after years of internal and external strife. The fire has also damaged much of Paris, but few homes were so thoroughly destroyed as the Louvre. It is unclear if the fire was intentional and many rumors have been floating around of it being caused by a Burgundian agent, someone trying to loot the palace in the middle of the night and knocking over a lantern, or by someone trying to stay warm during the night and letting a fire grow uncontrolled. Regardless of intent many French nationalists see this as the end of the Dual Monarchy's control over the French Metropole and many in Dual Monarchy now clamor for an immediate end to the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG490.A;Where is our $MONARCHTITLE$ supposed to live now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG491.T;The $YEAR$ Great Fire Of Londres;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG491.D;A great conflagration has broken out in Burgundian occupied Londres along the north bank of the River Thames. The fire started in the middle of the night within the Tower of Londres under unknown but most likely deliberate circumstances. This fire quickly overtook the Tower and spread out along Pudding Lane and almost reached St. Paul’s Cathedral, but the recent advances made in firefighting have spared the Cathedral from damage. Still the loss of what was the symbol of royal authority over Londres has now equally inflamed the English nationalists who want to see the removal of the Plantagenêts removed from England. They also point to Burgundy being able to cross the Channel as reason of Plantagenêt incompetence and unless this war comes to an end soon the Dual Monarchy will also go down in flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG492.D;"War is cruelty. There is no use trying to reform it. The crueler it is, the sooner it will be over."-Patrice de Lhuys, military governor of Anvers\n\nAs if having Anvers occupied by Anglois troops wasn't bad enough, the occupying forces have taken it upon themselves to intentionally destroy our property as well. The target of this Anglois destruction were the commercial dockyards of Anvers. The Dual Monarchy has done this to send a message that unless we end the war soon then destruction like this may befall all of Burgundy. While the dockyards had lagged behind in development like those in Amsterdam, the loss of the symbolic value of the port facilities has had its intended effect and has greatly damaged the support for the war. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG493.T;Amsterdam Stock Exchange Comes Crashing Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG493.D;The loss of Amsterdam was already an embarrassment, but the Anglois forces have decided to twist the knife by trying to damage our economy. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was one of the largest centers of trade for our Kingdom, but now it has been reduced to ashes. While many traders kept their own records outside of the exchange, many other trading records and bonds were still in the exchange when the Anglois burnt it down. Chaos is spreading among our traders as they try to reconcile their ledgers and many of them have publicly petitioned us to end the war in order to try and protect the economy from any further harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG500.D;”Nothing of that which was gained by fraud can go to the liberation of man’s soul.” - Charlemagne, quoted by Notker Balbalus\n\nThe Hundred Years War has been undone in the most spectacular way imaginable. The Burgundian military has laid low the vaunted Anglois realm and Anvers has seen fit to put an end to it. In a glorious ceremony in Paris, King Jean VI was crowned King of the French, and the Anglois were forced to sign a vast peace treaty which transferred all of their continental possessions to the Burgundians. Never in living memory has a coronation of such ostentatious opulence been seen, nor a military victory brought forth such a colossal revision of borders. Burgundian ultranationalists have long claimed their inheritance of Lothar and Charlemagne’s legacy and now their words are filled with new meaning.

BRG53.D;”I herewith renounce for all time claims to the throne of Burgundy. At the same time I release all officials, soldiers, sailors, and officers from the oath of fidelity which they tendered to me as their King and Commander-in-Chief.” - Abdication of Jean VI\n\nDuring the occupation of Anvers Dual Monarchy soldiers have uncovered a series of documents, one of which show that Bourbon-Bellegarde created the Rhone Dispatch in exchange for being crowned grand-duke of Toulouse. Other documents show the crimes that Jean VI has committed in bringing this war to fruition and in the face of public pressure he has abdicated the throne and the absolutist government he had set up has fallen apart with members from the old Parliamentary faction taking control and declaring Burgundy a republic. A peace between the Dual Monarchy and the new Parliamentary Republic of Burgundy has been concluded with the cession of Bourgogne and Calais as was claimed by the King of France and England since the XVIth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRG63.T;The Reorganization of France;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRG63.D;The liberation of France presents a problem. Much of the country is still dominated by the Anglois-speaking Catholic elite, and even where this is untrue, the populace remains hostile to either Protestantism or to Burgundian culture. Separatist militias have also arisen, seeking either the restoration of the Anglois regime or the creation of a new French state in their image. All told the region is far too chaotic for us to introduce direct rule at this time. Instead we will organize an autonomous government to quell the unrest and establish the foundations for our administration. To avoid feeding separatist narratives, this government will be known as “Neustria” after the old Frankish kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

France is filled with many restive agitators who would relish the chance to seize any possible justification to revolt against us. Therefore the only solution which will guarantee the safety of our administration there is to employ a two-step program : first, we will terminate the occupation authority within France, and second, we will devolve administration of France to a regional government composed of French nationals. This system will severely limit the economic and political presence of Anvers within France, but it may be the only way to avert a French revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Such an uplifting of patriotic feeling, love for our homes, and devotion to the nation, which has swept over our land like a hurricane, serves in my eyes, and I think in yours, as a guarantee of victory. In this united outburst of affection and readiness for all sacrifices, even that of life itself, I feel the possibility of upholding our strength, and quietly and with confidence look to the future. We are not only protecting our honor and our dignity within the limits of our land, but also that of Europe, whose fate we hold in our hands. I am overjoyed to see unity among Burgundians emerge into strong prominence throughout the land.

Veterans from the Civil War took control of the capital and the major cities, ending the previous government. The coup was swift and well organised, with the General Schnaebelé proclaimed Protector of the Burgundian State.

BRG820.D;”Apres moi, le déluge (After me comes the flood).” - King Jean VI\n\nThe war against the German regime was without precedent in scale, scope, or sacrifice. Thus it was expected it would end in the long-promised “Victoire finale” (Final Victory), a Frankish-dominated Europe. Instead it brought only a cowardly peace without reward to the nation. This morning Seneschal Bernard Bataille, the esoteric leader of the ultranationalist paramilitary Force Palatine, marched on Anvers and demanded to be made head of government “to address this moment of national crisis”! The central government had little choice but to bow to his demand, but Bataille’s coup has thrown the lands beyond Burgundy proper into chaos, with both regional governors and nationalist rebels rising up in defiance of the infamously fanatical Seneschal. Charlemagne’s inheritors once more shed the blood of their kin and the Frankish peoples remain their own worst enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG843.D;“Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.” - Holy Roman Emperor Ladislaus I\n\nWhen Richard the Justiciar was recognized as Duke of Burgundy in 918, nobody could have predicted how far that realm would rise. Nearly a thousand years after the start of his reign, Burgundy has grown into a colossus. From the German forests to the Pyrenees, none contest its rule or its status as the master of Europe. With all of Burgundy’s old enemies on the continent laid low before her might, the Burgundian Head of State has made the momentous decision to declare the creation of a new realm - a Frankish realm, the rebirth of that ancient nation which once illuminated Europe with its glory! Not since the Treaty of Verdun in 843, that terrible mistake, has Earth known such a mighty and universal empire. Let the world tremble at the coming of the greatest power of them all, the one which shall hold power of life and death over civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

At a meeting of leading regional politicians in Maestricht, a new constitution has been signed to create the “Paneuropean Union,” a confederation within which each major cultural group shall have their own autonomous administration. Its national anthem, “Ode to Joy” by Friedrich Wilhelm Küng, a Swabian author, symbolizes its spirit of unity beyond ethnicity or creed.

BRG990.T;Famine in the Rhineland and Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG990.D;Our officials in the Rhineland have reported the beginning of a famine across the German lands. A potato blight of unprecedented severity has begun to spread across the region, and much of Europe has also seen bizarre variations in weather over the last few years. Furthermore the feebleness of the Imperial government, in large part due to the punitive terms of the Treaty of Paris which we forced upon them in 1820, have severely hampered the ability of the Emperor to direct relief. Add to this the fact that German agricultural exports are a pillar of their economy and the situation seems likely to worsen. The Rhineland is no different and the Rhenish Germans are now facing bitter hunger as their staple crop, potatoes, withers away.\nWhile most experts foresee a brief if painful time of hunger, Dr. Jules Dumas of the University of Anvers has ominously predicted that this famine may become §REurope’s worst since the Great Famine of 1315.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG990.A;Let’s hope that he’s wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG991.T;The Dutch Potato Famine of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG991.D;Potatoes have become the staple crop of the Dutch farmers of the Netherlands since their introduction in the 18th century. Prized for their reliability, versatility, and nutrient content, many Dutchmen derive much of their daily sustenance from potatoes, and many Dutch farmers make their living from them. However, the last two years have seen wild weather anomalies, with bitter winters and torrents of spring rain, ravaging potato fields. Worse, the German blight is now spreading amongst the crops which have survived. Now whole towns across the north have seen their economies crumble as thousands of farmers have lost much of their crop in a matter of weeks, and if current projections are accurate then the next harvest could see a shortfall of sixty percent! This is more than a financial disaster. Famine is looming in the Netherlands, and if action is not taken then it may soon spread across Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG992.D;The potato blight has come to $PROVINCENAME$. Its communities were already facing low harvest due to poor weather conditions over the last few years and this has made the situation even worse. Whole potato fields have now been rendered inedible. Farmers across the region are faced with the agonizing choice of either eating what meager crops remain and not making any money or selling all but the most necessary foodstuffs to reap even the smallest profit. Starvation is rising and many people are choosing to emigrate abroad rather than face a painful death at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

And I beheld, and lo a black horse : and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.” - Revelations 6 : 6\n\nA combination of a horrendous potato blight and a labyrinth of economic and weather conditions threaten to plunge Burgundy into starvation. We have imposed an emergency ban on food exports to staunch the bleeding but we must aid the less developed areas of our realm. Both the Dutch and the Rhenish Germans are in desperate need of attention, but our resources are limited, and only one region can be prioritized. §RThis is a never-before-seen cataclysm. Whether we focus aid to the Netherlands or the Rhineland, the region that loses out may never forgive us.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG995.D;A combination of a horrendous potato blight and a labyrinth of economic and weather conditions threaten to plunge the Netherlands into starvation. We have imposed an emergency ban on food exports to staunch the bleeding. New bills are making their way through the legislature to force Dutch merchants to sell foodstuffs to local citizens at fair market prices, prevent hoarding, and distribute food aid to affected Dutch communities. Thankfully the situation in the Rhineland appears to be less severe than had been initially reported, so we can concentrate upon aiding the Dutch and lessening the risk of a severe famine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG996.T;End of the Hollowing in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG996.D;The worst of the crisis in the north has passed. Farms are recovering and state food assistance is helping communities get back onto their feet. But the scars of the Hollowing have by no means faded. Small towns have been almost abandoned by families searching for food and employment, or by those who chose to emigrate rather than wait for relief which for all they knew might never come. The disruption of the agricultural economy cannot be understated, and many farmers who saw just how callous their landlords and merchants acted to their plight will not accept a return to the old order. Instead they demand new reforms, and the push for greater control of their community’s governments are causing friction amongst the Dutch. All told we have not heard the last of this dreadful affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG997.T;Additional Relief to the Provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG997.D;The nation continues to recover from the scourge of the Hollowing, with the Burgundian heartland thankfully spared the worst of the famine. However the Netherlands and the Rhineland were not so lucky, with starvation and emigration wreaking havoc upon our frontiers. While major aid has already been supplied to both areas the question has arisen as to whether we might be able to expedite recovery through expanded support. If we have provided the bulk of government aid to either the north or the east in the past then it would be logical to favor the hitherto neglected region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG998.T;Rise of the Bloc Française;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG998.D;The inclusion of the French and the Anglois within our nation continues to cause headaches. Their participation in the mainstream political parties has, in the minds of many French nationalists, failed to bring their region the respect and the attention which they feel it deserves. A new alliance of regional French and Anglois parties has now been formed under the banner of the Bloc Française (French Bloc, also known as BF or simply as “the Bloc”). The Bloc seeks to bring the French and their Anglois kin together around the shared cause of French culture, French styles of Roman Catholic Christianity, and the legal customs of France. Despite this seemingly conservative posture the Bloc supports many welfare policies more typical of social democratic parties. Although the Bloc officially seeks only to “establish the necessary conditions for a free France” and has denounced armed secessionist violence, its formation has ensured that French nationalism will remain in the public eye for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG999.T;Rise of the OAS;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG999.D;Our persecution of French and Anglois nationalists, and suppression of the Roman Catholic Church in the French lands, has provoked a fierce reaction. A French nationalist paramilitary group known as the Organisation Armée Secrète (Secret Armed Organization, or OAS) has been organized in Italy, formed out of many smaller groups. The OAS seeks an independent French state “by any means necessary,” and while they are divided between monarchism and republicanism, they are united in their loathing of Burgundians. We believe that they are funded by internal collaborators, foreign contributions from French and Anglois emigrants, and by bank robberies and other crimes. Their acts of bombing and murder have targeted not only Burgundian politicians and military officers but also anti-independence French officials as well, whom they reserve a special hatred for and denounce as “willing slaves of the Anti-France.” While few will admit to supporting them in public, we suspect that many French people sympathize with their goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG9999.D;Emperor Guillaume has caught wind of certain plans by the military and the business establishment to press forward a campaign of aggressive expansion across Europe - and he is not pleased. Recently he summoned his highest generals and admirals to his palace, and harangued them for their vanity and their greed. Guillaume has made it clear that he feels the ideology based on Jean VI's policies has gone too far, and that the rising tide of violence fomented by reactionary elements, not just against racial and religious minorities but against so-called "enemies of the state," threatens to plunge the Empire into despotism. He finished his remarks by informing the officers of his intent to issue a new constitution - and, as a peace offering to the opposition, appoint a leading socialist as the new Prime Minister. The officers left the room horrified at the Emperor’s obvious insanity. They soon agreed that it may be necessary for him to experience an “accident” - just enough to incapacitate him and let them take the reins in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

Let them take courage amid perplexities and perils, for it may well be that the final extinction of a baleful domination will pave the way to a broader solidarity of all the men in all the lands than we could ever have planned if we had not marched together through the fire.

occupation_of_paris_desc;The offensive into the Dual Monarchy's continental possessions have gone very well and their capital city of Paris is now in our hands. However, the Anglois continue to fight us and more drastic actions may be required. By destroying the Louvre Palace we will humiliate the Plantagenêt monarch and possibly stir up French Nationalists against their war effort. We must also make sure that no one knows we intentionally destroyed the palace, otherwise we will lose the international goodwill we built up from the Rhone Dispatch. §RNote: If we do this and also burn the Tower of Londres then we can enforce the harshest peace onto the Dual Monarchy and claim the title of King of France after enforcing our demands onto them.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If we do this we will not have to worry about international backlash as whatever we do here will be expected of us from that phony Rhone Dispatch. §RNote: If we do this and also dissolve the Amsterdam Stock Exchange then we can enforce the harshest peace onto Burgundy and establish a more cooperative government after enforcing our demands onto them.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_swabia_vsSGF_desc;Swabia should be ours! It is the natural southeastern frontier of Burgundy. It was only through treacherous and cowardly tactics that the Danubians were able to claw it away from us. The de Bouillon monarchy was weak and decadent, unable to even get its own affairs in order, let alone project its power eastwards. Now that we have surpassed the Ancien Regime, it falls to us to punish the Danubians for their usurpation! Swabia will be liberated from their clutches, and take its place within the new Burgundian order!

take_over_berg_desc;Berg is the linchpin of our foreign policy in northwestern Germany. Its capital city of Dusseldorf is one of the largest in the eastern Rhineland. Before his ousting, King Jean VI had planned to use Berg as the foundation of a united Rhenish state under Burgundian control. He may have been a tyrant, but his plan has merits. Therefore we must bring Berg under control, so that we can resume our consolidation of western Germany under our leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the Rhenish Confederation is still a crucial buffer state for Burgundy’s security, and so we must succeed where he failed and restore our control of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He erred, as was typical given his backwards mentality, in seeking to found the Rhenish union on reaction and the old principles of monarchism, rather than looking to the new politics of the future. This meant that when his decadent regime crumbled, the Bohemians were able to take control of the eastern Rhineland. We must succeed where the old tyrant failed, and bring all of western Germany under our influence!

It is for all these reasons that the socialist community must combine into the Paneuropean Union of Socialist Republics.

The hermit kingdom has ended and the Korean Republic has been declared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME334715;Creation of the Korean Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC334715;Emperor Komei has been left in horrid position where it is for all intents and purposes impossible to directly rule over Korea without any potential independence revolt popping up and promptly kicking Japan out of Korea. A alternative plan regarding the creation of a highly subservient Korean Protectorate has been drafted and for now it seems as if this is the only way where Japan will be able to keep Korea. Indeed, many do see this as dishonourable but if there was any other possible way to keep Korea without a potentially destructive revolt while our nation has been left in a extremely broken state then Komei would do that instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME334716;The Unthinkable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

piast_union_title;The Return of the Piasts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
piast_union_desc;The duchy of Teschen has been ruled by a cadet branch of the Piast dynasty, the first dynasty of Poland since the Middle Ages. Vassals of Bohemia for centuries, they have become independent in recent times and contacts between the Commonwealth and Teschen have increased, with Polish nationalists clamoring for the unification of the Silesian Poles with their brethren. Thankfully the succession of the duchy allows for an easy integration, as the Duke of Teschen only has one daughter, Hedwige, who could marry the heir of the Polish King and peacefully integrates Teschen into the Rzeczpospolita.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

the_last_stand_PLC;The Last Stand of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_last_stand_PLC_desc;The Hohenzollern King has outed the intentions of the nobility and foreign nations to the general public and parties of the Commonwealth and this has sent them into a complete fury. This shall be nothing less then a total war for the survival of the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_serfdom_PLC_title;Destroy Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_serfdom_PLC_desc;Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. A good portion of the Commonwealth's Economy has been eternally tied into this outdated system, kept back by a nobility with far too much power for the modern era. Now that we have curtailed their power we can finally do what has needed to be done for over a hundred years now and end this terrible curse. Let the Commonwealth prosper forever more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
nat_poland_title;Adopt Nationalist Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nat_poland_desc;The Polish nation has long been the light of civilization for Eastern Europe. We created uniatry, we spread science and technology, and how have our ungrateful "friends" repaid us? It will not happen again! Only fascism can bring freedom to Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rev_poland_title;Adopt Revolutionary Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
rev_poland_desc;For too long we have been mere "cattle" to our masters.The noble working people of Poland have risen up against the old orders, and our new, socialist, state is preparing to pay back the feudal oppressors for all they have done for centuries. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#the_belarussian_claim_LIT_title;The Belarusian Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#the_belarussian_claim_LIT_desc;The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had integrated the former Principality of Polotsk in its early years of existence to defend them from the continued brunt of the Mongol invasions. Therefore it is due to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that the Belarusian people even exist and with the collapse of the Commonwealth we must claim all the territory in where they have settled in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
restore_the_grand_duchy_LIT_title;Restore the Grand Duchy Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
restore_the_grand_duchy_LIT_desc;With the ascension of $COUNTRY$ to international relevancy and a loose, but ultimately rightful claim on the rest of Ruthenia. It should be now possible to restore $COUNTRY$ to its fifteenth century borders once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NATPOLpolishempire_title;The Polish Diaspora;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NATPOLpolishempire_desc;As $COUNTRY$ has returned to its status as a greater power of Europe once again- it must make its imperative that of claiming all territories of the Polish diaspora in Europe. Never again shall the Polish live under a country that is not their rightful motherland! WARNING: Will remove the ability to form the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLclaimsilesia_title;The Silesian Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLclaimsilesia_desc;The Silesian Piasts had broken off the Kingdom of Poland during their insane attempt to claim the entire Kingdom for their own in the 12th Century. Rather then accept defeat they decided to beg to the Holy Roman Emperor for vassalization. This was a betrayal of the highest level and one of the single most catastrophic failures in Polish History, dooming countless Poles to German rule. The Kingdom had continued to claim the territory before Casimir III (the Jew) signed a treaty that would result in its permanent integration into the Kingdom of Bohemia. As Casimir III was clearly not sound of mind when he signed this disguising treaty, we formally repudiate the Treaty of Trentschin and claim Silesia as rightful polish territory once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLpiastkingdom_title;The Piast Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
FASPOLpiastkingdom_desc;The Piasts were the semi-legendary founders of the Kingdom of Poland that possessed territory as far as the modern Oder River. However, after several centuries of a expansionist Holy Roman Empire the Polish were ultimately pushed back and replaced by German settlers that rapidly Germanized the territory. As our glorious ultranationalist state is the rightful inheritors to the Kingdom of Poland, we must undo this injustice and liberate the territory that is rightfully ours. For Lech and the Polish People!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

all_the_commonwealths_desc;The Peoples of the Commonwealth stand united against the threats of their enemies. After decades of humiliation and decadence, our Union has been shaped anew to prosper in the coming centuries. In the chamber of the Great Sejm, the representatives of the Ruthenian Voivdeships vocally ask for the reunification with their brothers across the frontier. In Livonia and Moldavia, the hatred for inept and unjust rule has created a wide support for integration into our Union. These voices shall not fall unheard! The Rzeczpospolita resurges!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
greater_commonwealth_title;Reclaim the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
greater_commonwealth_desc;During the 1839-1840 Sejm, the Commonwealth had encountered troubles in the east that had ultimately resulted in a great deal of the territory permanently leaving the Commonwealth. Through noble conspiracy and political abuse it was impossible to reclaim this territory but now that the nobility have been curtailed and the union has been successfully federalized through the new Treaty of Lublin, The Commonwealth should now be able to embark of a reconquest of its rightful territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
liberum_veto;Liberum Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
liberum_veto_desc;Nie pozwalam! - Thus any chance of a aggressive war has ended. Do not justify on civilized nations until the nobility has been curtailed if you do not wish to receive this modifier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC_inevitable_sejm;The Inevitable Sejm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC_inevitable_sejm_desc;Maximilian III has been dying for some time now and the Sejm is starting fight between themselves regarding whom the next king should be. It is unlikely that any wars will be possible until this stalemate is resolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME222240;Liberum Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC222240;The discussions regarding a soon-to-be offensive war have been permanently stalled as a single greater noble screams out the eternally cursed words- Nie pozwalam! or "I do not allow". Thus- as in all sessions of the polish sejm when this is stated: the deliberation and debate comes to a complete halt and all legislation is for all intents and purposes nullified. So long as the nobility remain at such an incredible level of power in the Commonwealth, it is unlikely that any offensive wars will be possible beyond that of colonial expeditions in so-called uncivilized countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA222240;The bastards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22233;The Failed Dissolution of the Sejm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22233;The King of the Commonwealth had entered the Sejm with the intent to dissolve it and appoint a new party, but he was abruptly reminded that the Golden Liberties given to the "people" of the Commonwealth do not allow such a action to take place. The King would leave the Sejm- embarrassed in his inability to act in a manner that could benefit the decaying Commonwealth. It is clear that he will have to wait for a opportunity to deprive the nobility of their so called "Golden Liberties".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC22.T;Prussia leaves the Commonwealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC22.D;The problems in the coordination of power caused by the March Revolution greatly alarmed the Duchy of Prussia. Today they have declared that they do not recognize the new government and are severing all ties with Warsaw. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC22.A;They will pay for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC23.T;The East Withdraws;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC23.D;The inability for the Commonwealth to manage the problems in Smolensk has led to a complete loss of influence in the East. Many Cossack Hosts were loyal to Maximilian personally, not to the Commonwealth at large, and his death has caused our influence over the Wild Fields to wither. The Cossacks in years past would regularly report to the Registry, so that the details of the Cossack Hosts could be tracked and their loyalties reaffirmed. Now the Cossacks have stopped reporting to the Registry, with all of the Hosts once loyal to Warsaw turning away to focus on their own affairs. Were we in a stronger position, we might be able to launch punitive expeditions to force them back into line. Alas, the Sejm is so hopelessly divided, mired in petty squabbles and fearful of risking any resources on foreign adventures, that no such mission can be executed. All we can do is watch as the east returns to savagery, and hope that one day, we may tame it for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC23.A;We will return in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
#### The Good Sejm - Russia do not Exists ####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC24.T;Our King is Dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC24.D;Our beloved King has died in his sleep tonight. While Kashtelan is preparing the funeral, Convocation sejm is preparing the election of the new monarch. In recent decades, the situation in our Commonwealth has been extremely unstable, and many fear that this Sejm may be the last... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC27.T;The Bohemian Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC27.D;The informants could not lie. Something was definitely wrong at this Sejm. Organized attempts to disrupt the voting with petty scuffles, the long failure to come to unanimous choice, despite the fact that majority clearly supported the winning candidate. After a series of investigations, everything became clear - the Emperor of Bohemia had drawn to his side a huge number of Polish nobles, who for the sake of money or promises of power were ready to disrupt the Sejm. Now, the source of the past strife has become quite clear - the Polish szlachta is rotten because of corruption, greed, and disloyalty to their own Crown. The time has come to rectify this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC27.A;Nie pozwalam ci byc zdrajca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.T;The Szlactha Purge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.D;The order for the guard was quite clear: to arrest about 750 noblemen together with their families and cronies on charges of high treason. Although most of the list had already left the Sejm, the arrest of those who remained gave the entire szlachta a clear message: the King would not tolerate foreign agents within the nobility of his state. The arrested estates, mills, and other industries were, of course, commandeered at the expense of the treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC28.A;Down with traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC29.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC29.D;After the arrest of disloyal noblemen and their replacement in the Sejm by representatives of the bourgeoisie and petty nobility loyal to their King, the Sejm took the first step toward the reform of our glorious Commonwealth. The Constitution, the first draft of which was approved by the Sejm, divides the Sejm into two chambers: Sejm Rzeczypospolitej, elected by a popular secret vote, and the Senate, appointed by the King from the representatives of the provinces and large cities. This Constitution also guarantees freedom of the press, assembly, and workers' self organization. In Europe and the New World, this Constitution is already being called the most liberal in the World, which has greatly increased the prestige of our monarchy among international community. Despite the displeasure of the reactionaries, this Constitution will serve as the first step toward the true unification of the nations of the Commonwealth into one state, strong and independent among great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

### Polish Nationalist Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.T;The Concept of a Polish Nation State;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.D;We live in an age of nationalism, and it is obvious to every reasonable ruler that to hold his state together it is necessary to create one nation that will speak and think in one language, read same newspapers, and, of course, love only one King. Today, King Augustyn proclaimed the beginning of a policy of "polonification," which is designed to create a single, consolidated nation based on Polish education and the Polish way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC32.A;One Nation, One Commonwealth, One King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.T;Abolishment of the Lithuanian Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.D;Today, at a meeting of the Sejm, the first step toward the unity of the Commonwealth of the Polish Nation was taken. Overriding the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's veto would rid us of the pesky Lithuanian nobility, which had already begun to resist our policy of polonification. This is a very unpleasant, but still a necessary step for the unity of the country, and we will make everyone accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC33.A;...the abolishment of Veto has been vetoed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.T;Forced abolishment of the Lithuanian Veto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.D;After a small embarrassment of overriding the Lithuanian veto, all Lithuanian deputies were escorted out of the meeting room. The king expressed his regrets over this, but also noted that such steps were necessary to preserve the unity of the state and its stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC34.A;Necessary sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.T;The Polonization Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.D;The law passed by the Sejm today can be called truly historic. From this day forward, all public education in languages other than Polish will be forbidden. It is also forbidden to publish newspapers, documents, and communication in the army in languages other than Polish. However, these laws caused discontent in those regions and army units where the majority are not Poles. Despite this, the Commonwealth of the Polish Nation is ready to take up any challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC35.A;I don't like where this is going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.T;Grand Duchy of Lithuania Proclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.D;The laws on polonification have definitively eroded the weak unity that institutionally and historically bound the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania together. Lithuania's withdrawal from the Commonwealth was the natural outcome of all the pressure that Poland began to put on the other territories. From now on, the Commonwealth of the Two Nations is just a fiction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC340.A;Sic transit gloria mundi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC350.T;The Warsaw Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC350.D;"Centralization, unification and the creation of a unified Polish state are absolutely necessary. In our time of instability and the disintegration of the old monarchies, only nationalism, true nationalism, can save our people. God has blessed us with a King who understands the challengeshe faces. Those who still today call themselves Ruthenians, Jews, Germans or Prussians will already be Poles tomorrow. This is not a threat, but an offer: an offer to walk together into the future as one." This speech from a famous Polish intellectual, reprinted by all the newspapers, was called the "Warsaw Speech" and de facto reflects all the intentions of the new state. The formal dissolution of the Commonwealth and the proclamation of an independent Kingdom of Poland is a progress, liberation out of the old feudal fetters hindering our nation. Onward to Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

### Hohenzollern Radical Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.T;The Great Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.D;It was obvious to King Adolf. His men delivered him all the proof he needed. The Bohemian and Russian emperors had indeed bought - with money or promises of power, almost the entire nobility of the Kingdom of Poland. All that nobility, which was supposed to be the foundation of the state, betrayed the Commonwealth and its King. At today's meeting of the Sejm, the King accused all the conspirators by name. Those who were present in the hall were immediately arrested, and the rest fled far away to Kyiv. Instead of noblemen traitors, the King filled the Sejm with men loyal to him from merchants, administrators and churchmen, who must now put an end to the Great Conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC41.A;Out with traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC42.T;Prussia goes silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,  
PLC42.D;We received a letter from Prussia. In the letter, the Prussian government declares its renunciation of all treaties with the Commonwealth and declares its complete independence and neutrality toward it. All Polish representatives will be expelled from Prussia, and all Prussian subjects are to return home immediately. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC42.A;Take hostages before they leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.T;The Sejm of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.D;Those traitors who fled to Kyiv had the nerve to assemble their own Sejm. At the Sejm they elected as king a miserable man, not even worthy to be called by name. We have made it clear to other countries that this "king" is only a pawn of Bohemia and Russia, while the true king of the Commonwealth is Adolf August.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC43.A;The Conspiracy is now clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.T;Exposing our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.D;Today, diplomatic notes were sent to the emperors of Bohemia and Russia. Although, one might rather call these not notes, but insults. In these notes, the King exposed their intrigues against the Commonwealth, and assured them that the Commonwealth is stronger than ever and would stand up to any aggression from their miserable states. General mobilization is declared throughout the country, and the generals are ordered to prepare for war. Some half-whispered this as a diplomatic disaster, but their voices are quickly silenced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC44.A;We do not fear you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.T;Bohemian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.D;"In view of King Adolf's intolerable rhetoric, threats, and blatant aggression toward His Majesty the Emperor and His Crown, His Majesty the Emperor sees no alternative but to declare war on the Commonwealth". A note with these contents was received today by our ambassador from the diplomatic service of the Emperor of Bohemia. The outposts on the western frontier are already reporting an approaching enemy, and evacuation has already begun in the cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC45.A;Fight, you cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.T;Russian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.D;Our units on the eastern border report large Russian troops heading west. This is war, and we must hold out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC46.A;Fight, you cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.T;Treaty of Kalusz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.D;Today, in the small town of Kalush in Galicia, a long-awaited peace was signed between the Commonwealth on the one hand, and Russia and Bohemia on the other, putting an end to the bloody war that the vile enemies unleashed against our state. The false "King" is nowhere to be seen, and his supporters were detained and hanged. Our, tired of war, are nevertheless happy to emerge victorious from it and are already beginning to praise their king. A new era in the history of the Commonwealth begins, an era in which external enemies are put to the foot and internal ones destroyed. Hooray to King Adolf August!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC47.A;May his reign be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.T;Disaster of the 'The War of Adolf';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.D;That can't be... The armies of the Commonwealth are completely destroyed. The cities are occupied. Forts blown up. Traitorous nobles are already declaring the independence of their worthless countries, and our own subjects are looting and murdering loyalists in a rage. In this situation, Adolphus Augustus felt like it was a dream, or a nightmare. The king did not believe it was possible. And His Majesty saw only one way out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC48.A;A shot rang out across Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC49.D;This early morning, the Election sejm opened it's doors for the szlachta who is ready to take part in the election of their new King. Archbishop of Gniezno opened the Sejm by prayer, Marszalek was chosen, and this marked the opening of several days of endless intrigue, bribery and pressure to attract voters from all over the Commonwealth. Election has passed smoothly, and the winner is:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC50.D;The informants could not lie. Something was definitely wrong at this Sejm. Organized attempts to disrupt the voting with petty scuffles, the long failure to come to unanimous choice, despite the fact that majority clearly supported the winning candidate. After a series of investigations, everything became clear - the Emperor of Bohemia had drawn to his side a huge number of Polish nobles, who for the sake of money or promises of power were ready to disrupt the Sejm. Now, the source of the past strife has become quite clear - the Polish szlachta is rotten because of corruption, greed, and disloyalty to their own Crown. The time has come to rectify this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC50.A;Your treachery is done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.T;Warsaw falls into anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.D;It went... Not the way we intended. Instead of Guardsmen ready to arrest traitors, we have corrupt lazybones who were bought very cheaply. Some traitors have begun to fight back, and the crowds in the streets of Warsaw are already smashing up the mansions of the large szlachta in the hope of getting their hands on the property of those who have been killed, escaped, or are in prison. Worse than that, the wave of riots has raised  all kinds of radicals, and red flags and appeals to hang all the szlachta from the trees are already flying in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC51.A;Yeah... Get my carriage ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.T;Reign of Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.D;Disaster. Across the country, estates are in flames. Every nobleman who has not yet fled the country hides in secret shelters, or, disguised, lives in the city dumpsters pretending to be a pauper. "Wealth," "nobility," and "title" have become the worst curses in these few weeks. Commoners happily remove furniture from the estates and burn the buildings themselves as symbols of oppressors and traitors. The king does not react at all to what is happening, causing aggression from his seemingly most reactionary and conservative supporters. However, this has a plus side - all the nobles, bought by Bohemia or not, are withdrawn from political affairs, and the King can replace them in the Sejm with people loyal to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC52.A;Our nobility is gone now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.T;New Dawn of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.D;The terror had come to an end. While the mob rampaged through the streets, the King and his fully loyal Sejm were able to prepare a new constitution - a liberal constitution respectful of every Commonwealth citizen, not just the nobility. Event if this incurred the displeasure of the reactionaries, this Constitution will serve as the first step toward the true unification of the nations of the Commonwealth into one state, strong and independent among great powers. Despite all the horror that our country has endured, we can now look to the future with cautious confidence, with hope that this will not happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC53.A;Happy end?..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#The Deluge - Monarchy is lost before nobility is purged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC54.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC54.D;Our ancient monarchy, the institution that bound the Commonwealth, is gone. Along with the monarchy, gone is the illusion of stability that our society has been living with in recent years. The insurgents rampaging all over Poland proved the government's complete inability to keep the situation under control. One by one, our dependent territories began to declare their independence, frightened by what was happening in the metropolis. The Commonwealth was dissolved, not de-jure, but de-facto, and now our homeland awaits terrible times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC55.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC55.D;With the loss of one of our substate, the world has become convinced of the Crown's inability to maintain even the illusion of stability in the Commonwealth. An outraged military overthrew the monarchy, but that only made things worse. One by one our substates are declaring independence and break any connections with the government in Warsaw. We are now facing the worst crisis in our history, and in this troubled times, we can rely only on God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC55.A;Discordia maximae dilabuntur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.T;Potop;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.D;Modern problems require modern solutions. Unfortunately, our system could not provide these solutions. Having lived through the turbulent 19th century, our Commonwealth could learn no lessons from it. Largely feudal, without a strong government, it is falling under the weight of its problems. Various nationalists and radicals are arming themselves and taking power in our lands, and we have no way to fight them. The Commonwealth can be considered as no longer existing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC550.A;Discordia maximae dilabuntur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC56.T;The End of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC56.D;The inability for Poland to secure its most vital territories in the recent crisis has resulted in it finally succumbing under the weight of its own contradictions. A final Sejm was called with the intent to stabilize the political situation in the country but it is clear by now that absolutely everyone blames Warsaw for its catastrophic mismanagement that had lead to this horrific circumstance. Greater and a good deal of Lesser Poland both preferring to make deals with the Germans in the west then stand another minute of this utter disgrace of a nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC59.D;The new government was unable to defend even its own territories.

PLC63.T;Russia claims supremacy in the Uniate Chruch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC63.D;Today the Uniate dioceses on the territory of the newly formed Russian Empire made a shocking statement. They demanded that the residence of the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia and all Rus be moved to Smolensk. They justified this by the fact that the current political situation in the Commonwealth threatened the security of the Church and that only the Russian state could ensure the prosperity of the Metropolitanate. We have heard that some Russian lobbyists in Rome supported this statement, but the final decision rests with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC63.A;Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC64.T;War with the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC64.D;After the Polish refusal to move the Metropolis to Smolensk, the only thing that $COUNTRY$ can do is to declare war on them - to ensure the safety and prosperity of all Christians who live in fear and poverty in the territories of the Commonwealth, of course. §RIf Russia wins this war, it will be the swan song of the Commonwealth.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC64.A;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC65.T;The Treaty of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC65.D;Today a shameful peace was signed in Kyiv. According to the terms of the peace, a large number of territories will pass under Russian control after a specific future date, but, most importantly, we refused to place on our territory the residence of the new Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and All Russia, and now he is "forced" to leave to Smolensk. With Russia inevitably taking away a large portion of our territory and the Church of the Eastern Slavs, the fate of the Commonwealth remains unclear. The King has already accepted responsibility for this defeat by abdicating the throne, and now we are assembling perhaps the most pessimistic Sejm in our history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC65.A;They will pay for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC66.T;The Treaty of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC66.D;On both sides of the front, many thought it was impossible, but it happened - we were able to defeat the ambitions of a young empire. Russia completely relinquishes any claim to ecclesiastical domination. However, many in our state considered this insufficient - the king was criticized in the Sejm for a peace that was considered separatist and for refusing territorial or monetary contributions. Under pressure, the king abdicated the throne, and now we gather the Sejm, which is already called the "Sejm of Triumphants," where we will elect a new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#old_act_of_union_desc;The Old Union of Lublin was signed in 1569 and merged both Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Unfortunately, due to the rapid decline of the Commonwealth: Lithuania has somehow regained its autonomy and fallen directly into the sphere of the Scandinavians.

However, with the arrival of the Mongol Empire the fate of Eastern Europe was forever changed and the Kievian Rus could never be restored again at its original borders. Kiev could still be the centre of a great empire once again, but one that unites what are now known as the Ruthenians- rather then that of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL11.T;The Ruthenia Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL11.D;The creation of a unified Russian state might have been a proud moment for $COUNTRY$, if not for the fact that its influence towards the Ruthenian peoples are limited due to the existence of a disgusting barely-stable mess of a "nation" known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to our influence in their last Sejm we have able to get a incompetent idiot on their throne which leaves the Uman Confederation open for influence. If we pull the right cords and promise them the territories of the former Dnieper Host in exchange for a legitimate deceleration of independence from the Commonwealth. We could persuade the nations of Central Europe that a "partition" is in order to stabilize Eastern Europe by using the "plight" of the Kievians as a example. We will supply and ultimately directly support this revolution if the Commonwealth refuses to pull out and use it as a justification to Central Europe for a partition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

222390.B;Incite a nationalist revolt? Are you MAD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.T;The Ruthenia Plot - Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.D;Russia has sent a letter in regards to the fate of the Commonwealth. A letter which proclaims that they intend to support a Ukrainian Revolt to prevent further instability in the region and promise us all the historically disputed territories in the western commonwealth if we support their efforts. $COUNTRY$ will be finally able to obtain Danzig, Pommern and Prussia without having to commit to any form of large war with the Commonwealth. This will likely be our only chance to retrieve them with such ease as attempting to retrieve them outside of this "legal partition" will count as a illegal conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.A;The Russians are right. Begin the proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.B;The Russians are insane. We shall have no part in this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.T;The Ruthenia Plot - A Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.D;We have been sent a letter from the Hetmanate, the Russian Empire and any interested German State on the matter of our national stability. We are to immediately remove our armies from the Uman Confederation, Danzig, "Belarus" and Pommern and allow them to call a sejm on the matter of "A Polish Partition" which will grant the newly formed "Malorussia" independence and put "unstable territories" in the care of appropriate nations. We will be permitted to keep Lithuania as a integrated part of the Commonwealth but we will immediately lose the Ukraine, Belarus, Pommern, Prussia and Pomerelia. If we refuse and attempt to reconquer the Ukraine then "they" will take military action- ALL OF THEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.A;We have no choice. If we tried to fight it is likely that we would be utterly destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.B;The Commonwealth shall not stand by and allow this to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.T;The Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.D;A sejm has been called in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by external nations regarding the stability of its territories and to ratify a new constitution. It (the sejm) has concluded that the current state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is unacceptable and that its territories must be reorganized according to the wishes of Russia and varied Central European powers. Critics of this event are calling it a blatant attempt by Russia and Central European powers to annex Commonwealth territory and that it will not increase the stability of Eastern Europe, but in an ironic twist of fate has at least finally inadvertently curtailed the nobility that has been plaguing the Commonwealth for decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222393.A;The bear better not come back for another meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.T;Annexation of Commonwealth Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.D;$COUNTRY$ has been granted territories as a result of various treaties and the ongoing collapse of the Commonwealth. We are the most viable option as the nobility in these states have been petitioning for immediate vassalization or annexation by $COUNTRY$ rather then any others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222395.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL16.T;The Annexation of Royal Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL16.D;$COUNTRY$ has been granted territories as a result of various treaties and the ongoing collapse of the Commonwealth. This particular territory is known as "Royal Prussia" which had originally been owned by the State of the Teutonic Order before it was annexed by the Commonwealth. The next goal of $COUNTRY$ should be the annexation of Danzig and finally the crown jewel of the region- Prussia itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222394.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL17.T;A Second Partition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL17.D;We have left Poland in a exceptionally weak state after the first partition and so this may be our chance to finally dissolve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for good with little or no cost to us at all. All we have to do is promise the nobility the restoration of their rights that they had lost during the aftermath of the First Sejm and that should cause enough of a catastrophe to tear the Commonwealth to pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.A;Send a letter to the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.B;We did enough in the First Partition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.T;The Second Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.D;The Government of Polish-Lithuania was left with a fatal flaw after the first partition. That being the fact that the nobility had been stripped of their "Golden Liberties" which had resulted in the immediate abolition of Serfdom, this would be a great boon in any other time period but with the external manipulations of Russia their "struggle" had been reignited. They had called a illegal Sejm in the city of Lwow and had called for the immediate dissolution of the Commonwealth to secure their so called rights "as given by god". The Commonwealth was unable to stop the troops that had already marched across its borders to secure treasonous noble estates and was forced to concede to the demands of the Sejm and the foreign nations seeking further territory and vassals. The Union of Lublin is broken. The Commonwealth is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222398.A;TRAITORS. THEY ARE ALL TRAITORS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL20.T;The Creation of Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL20.D;$COUNTRY$ has been petitioned to annex a large swath of Polish territory from the former Commonwealth by the nobility in the region to compensate for their losses incurred in the destruction of the Commonwealth.  As it is impossible to administrate this much territory directly, we have created a nation called Galicia to administrate this territory for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222399.A;Galicia shall be a useful puppet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL21.T;Commonwealth Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL21.D;Due to a set of varied and complex reasons the Commonwealth has lost control of several states. The nobility in these states are presently petitioning for immediate vassalization or annexation by $COUNTRY$ as it is the best possible choice with the neighbouring territories that $COUNTRY$ currently possesses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222400.A;The legality of this is questionable but its still effectively free land;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL22.T;The Destruction of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL22.D;Several years after the end of the Commonwealth, it has been made abundantly clear that Polish nationalism is nothing less then a extreme threat to Russian stability and that the concept of Poland as a whole is doing nothing more then weakening our nation state and allowing us to be threatened by other nations in the region. It is time to end our façade of ever caring about the plight of the Polish people and rather taking the path of utterly dissolving the Polish nation from existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.A;Poland shall die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.B;This is insanity. Stop! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.T;The Final Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.D;Russia has presented us with a ultimatum to immediately surrender our sovereignty to them in a act of blatant imperialism. If we surrender then Poland is effectively a dead nation, ready to be replaced by whatever puppet state that the Russians have come up with to replace Poland. If we don't surrender, we will be invaded and forced to fight a futile war. Its time for the final stand of Poland, are you willing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222402.A;POLAND IS NOT YET LOST!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222402.B;POLAND IS NOT YE.... what do you mean they own our economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.T;The Polish Miracle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.D;In a crushing blow for Russian prestige and a absolute triumph for Poland, Poland and its allies have defeated the Russian Army and prevented the complete destruction of Poland. It seems that Poland is not yet lost, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222403.A;Utrzymali swoje miejsce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.T;The Final Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.D;The Russian Army has marched into Warsaw and demanded the complete dissolution of Poland. The shock from the Sejm and the remaining nobility and other members of the ruling class has resulted in nothing less then complete anarchy in Poland as bourgeoisie in Krakow have declared independence in their own right and German troops march into Poznan to secure the rights of Germans in Greater Poland against the Russian menace. Upon this day, Poland has now ceased to exist and has been replaced by the Governorate of Vistula Land which has been made a puppet of $COUNTRY$. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222404.A;Polska jest stracona.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL26.T;The Final Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL26.D;With effective economic and political control over Poland, $COUNTRY$ has demanded the complete dissolution of Poland and the effective destruction of the entire concept of a unified Polish nation-state. Upon this day, Poland has now ceased to exist and has been replaced by a nation known just as "Mazovia" which has been made a puppet of $COUNTRY$. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.T;The Krakow League;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.D;In the complete chaos after the total dissolution of Poland, a league of merchants in the city of Krakow and nearby regions have seized the local institutions of government and refuse to listen to the pathetic orders of the Warsaw Government. They wish for a guarantee of their independence by $COUNTRY$ on the basis that it is only option they have in their current position. $COUNTRY$ could either accept the offer to guarantee their independence or take this opportunity to appoint our own puppet government after a swift invasion into the rogue state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.A;We must take this opportunity before we lose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL260.B;Just take the offer and pull them into our economic sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.T;The Fate of Swiety Andrzej;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.D;It the aftermath of the collapse of the Commonwealth, $COUNTRY$ has unintentionally been granted the relatively worthless island of Swiety Andrzej in the Caribbean as $COUNTRY$ is by far the most likely occupier due to varied cultural and political reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL263.A;We must seize control with urgency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL27.T;The New Union of Lublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL27.D;The Commonwealth has declared our autonomy null and void today as they ask for annexation via the signing of a new act of union. We can attempt to fight them but considering their relative strength it might just be better to give in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222406.A;This is the end of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL28.D;The Commonwealth has been in continuous decline since its formation in 1569 via the Union of Lublin.

POL29.D;The Commonwealth has been in continuous decline since its formation in 1569 via the Union of Lublin. However due to a rare moment of clarity in the sejm and effective leadership, The Commonwealth was able to break though its issues to declare a New Union of Lublin. This was not enough to stop the nationalists from successfully defeating the Commonwealth's attempts to annex them though and so the decline of the Commonwealth shall unfortunately continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222408.A;Wait? What!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL30.T;The Commonwealth Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL30.D;Our Non-Lithuanian minorities are not protected by the old Union of Lublin and we have to resort to giving them their autonomy again even after they revolted against us. We will need to create a new Union of Lublin if we ever hope to integrate these minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL31.T;The Prussian Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL31.D;The Duchy of Prussia had been claimed during the collapse of the Commonwealth by one of the many nations that skirt the Baltic Sea. They claim that we are to be immediately annexed into their nation as a "permanent protectorate" of their interests in the Baltic Sea and if we refuse then they will do so by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL32.D;The Curonian Ducal Colonial Trading Company is an institution that has lasted over 250 years and has managed to maintain its own triangle trade and even gain a few colonies around the globe. However, with the abolition of the monarchy and the promotion of Latvian nationalist ideals- there is no longer any reason to continue pretending that Courland as a concept still exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.T;The End of the Poznan Occupation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL261.D;It had been few months since we occupied Poznan, which is mainly populated by Poles. By creating a regime friendly to us we were able to further weaken the influence of Warsaw, but now there is the question of the future of this regime. We can give it independence by recognizing the government in Poznan as a legitimate Polish government or as a secondary option, we can appease radicals among us which are calling for the integration of Poznan into our state. There is a third option however, the monarch had taken it upon himself to inform the cabinet that we could attempt to found a Crown of Poland directly under the control of our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

conquest_of_lithuania_RUS_desc;Our diplomats have concocted a most impressive scheme. We will offer Lithuania false friendship in the face of Scandinavian aggressions. The Lithuanians will surely accept our help, and as a result will be made into a client state of $COUNTRY$, to be annexed shortly after, proving that sometimes words are more powerful than cannons. We should expect however, that Scandinavia will not be pleased by such a brilliant move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LITPRU1.T;Lithuanian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU1.D;After centuries in union with the Polish crown, Lithuania now faces its own destiny, to be governed by its own whims. This has culminated in a burst of new Lithuanian political thought and political unrest, as the authority that kept the Lithuanian-Litvin conflict at bay has all but disintegrated. The intellectual classes of the Samogitians and the Litvin aristocracy have locked horns, while there’s great uncertainty of how the Lithuanian state will continue, and what ethnicity it should truly represent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU1.A;Three hurrahs for Lithuania?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.T;The Collapse of the Grand Duchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.D;Half a millennia of Lithuanian rule has come to a close. Our lands are now torn apart between Samogitia and the newly formed Litvin kingdom of White Ruthenia, with its own desires of a nation state. Lithuania has not withstood the pressure exerted by its neighbours from all sides, and now it has succumbed to its own people from within. The dying appendage of the Commonwealth has breathed its last breath...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU2.A;The past withers away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.T;The end of Greater Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.D;The dream of a Lithuanian republic has been snuffed out today... The Samogitians have broken away from Greater Lithuania, and formed a Baltic Samogitian state of their own in hopes of maintaining what they view as the true authentic Lithuanian people. Greater Lithuania lays dead, carved into a rump state as White Ruthenia, while our people succumb to the new reality of their situation. Dreaming of the time Lithuania stood fest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU3.A;Greater Lithuania no more;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.T;The end of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.D;With a proclamation from our government in newly acquired Vilnius, Lithuania is declared to be abolished! Its former territories are now in our hands and are handled by our governors and officers accordingly. Dissolved, the lands of former Lithuania are now carved out and more easily managed by our state, and the reign of $COUNTRY$ in the Baltics will remain secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU4.A;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU5.T;Samogitia and White Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU5.D;The coming of the 19th century has not been kind to Lithuanian society in particular. The relations between our Litvins and Lithuanians have been increasingly sour, as the Litvins cemented themselves as the true influence in the Grand Duchy. In addition, our Ruthenian subjects resent the Litvins, viewing them as Ruthenian who are still being treated far better than the rest of them. Now, with the signing of the treaty of Hadiach, we have split Lithuania internally among the litvins and the Lithuanians by creating Samogitia and White Ruthenia as two separate territories, effectively partitioning old Lithuania. This move will surely help to calm down the tensions between our people, who’d take their newly founded autonomy with appreciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LITPRU6.D;As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has collapsed, its Baltic possessions are left undefended. Among these possessions stands the City of Danzig, an important Baltic port city in West Prussia, which was under the protection of the Polish crown. But more importantly is Danzig’s position in Prussian politics, as any power that controls it and Royal Prussia may project power unto and dominate the Duchy of Prussia, and as a result will enable us to secure the southern Baltic coast. To our luck, we currently occupy Pommerania, effectively isolating the city from any Polish or German power that might attempt to stop us from annexing the city state. Now with the fall of Poland, we may move to replace its status as the protector of Danzig and secure it and East Prussia for our own benefit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LITPRU7.D;As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has collapsed, its Baltic possessions are left undefended. Among these possessions stands Prussia and the City of Danzig, an important Baltic port city in West Prussia, which was under the protection of the Polish crown. But more importantly is Danzig’s position in Prussian politics, as any power that controls it and Royal Prussia may project power and dominate the Duchy of Prussia, and as a result will enable us to secure the southern Baltic coast. However, we are not the only power interested in Prussia. The Germans in the west have achieved a foothold near Danzig and would be ready to challenge any of our moves against the Danzigers and the Prussians. Dealing with this issue will require some maneuvering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU7.A;Our Baltic ambitions will be realized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.T;Danzig secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.D;We have repulsed Scandinavia’s encroachment on our German kin in Danzig and Prussia! Now with our protection, Danzig’s assembly has confirmed and approved its ascension into $COUNTRY$. In addition to Danzig, Prussia remains open to us, and with Danzig in our hands we may send the Baltic state an offer to join our nation with ease. It’s a glorious day to all Germans east and west of the Weichsel river!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU8.A;The Baltic coast remains German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU9.T;Danzig secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU9.D;We have sidelined the Germans' attempt to covet Danzig! Scandinavia's position in Danzig and Prussia has been solidified, and our position as the protector of the small Baltic states is indisputable. Now without Polish and German involvement, we may annex the coast and realize our dream of Scandinavian hegemony over the Baltic sea. Of course, Prussia might prove to be more hesitant to annexation than Danzig, but with the Germans out of the picture, we don’t have to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU9.A;Dominium maris baltici;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ annexes Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU10.D;Our effort to secure the Baltic coast has been thwarted by $FROMCOUNTRY$, who has entered Danzig with its forces, and officially annexed the city with the blessing of Danzig’s assembly. Word has spread that $FROMCOUNTRY$ even plans on marching to Prussia! We can only gaze at our neighbours across the Baltic sea with anger, as they take what should have been rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU10.A;Damned Danzigers and Damned Germans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU11.T;Scandinavia annexes Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU11.D;Scandinavia’s imperial ambitions in the Baltic sea have been furthered, as Scandinavia entered the city of Danzig and officially annexed it with the blessing of the city’s assembly. In addition, Scandinavia is now free to further its aggressive actions into Prussia! With this move, Scandinavia has strengthened its position in the Baltic sea and denied our brethren their right to be governed by their own! It’s a sad day for our countrymen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU11.A;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.T;Protecting Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.D;We need subtly if we want to deal with Danzig and Prussia, making outright aggressive moves might draw the ire of the Germans to the west. Some of our officials suggest dispatching a proposal to the city, and offering it our protection as a replacement of Poland’s. Danzig holds no particular loyalty towards the crown of Poland and may agree to our demands. But regardless of our request, it is safe to expect a German reaction to any dialogue between Danzig and our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.A;Send the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU12.B;We shouldn’t anger our neighbours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.T;Scandinavia offers protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.D;As Poland collapsed, our status in the region has been shaken to its core. We lived for centuries under Polish autonomy as a center of trade and German culture. But now in the chaos of the present, Scandinavia has come bearing an offer of “protection”. Scandinavia proposes to protect and aid the city from foreign threats, stressing our shared heritage in the Baltic sea as the basis. Most of Danzig’s assembly is distraught, as the proposal reeks of territorial ambition and the expansion of its empire as it has done in the rest of the baltic coast. Most in our city express more sympathy towards the Germans in the west, identifying with them as an ethnic kin in comparison to the Nordic Scandinavians, and many wish to petition Germany for protection instead. But some in our assembly are friendly to Scandinavia, expressing optimism about the economy of our city should it be integrated into Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.A;The assembly accepts the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU13.B;The assembly calls on Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.T;Danzig calls for help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.D;As Poland collapsed, Danzig’s status in the region has been shaken to its core. The city has existed as an autonomy of Poland for centuries and flourished as a center of trade and German culture. But now in the chaos of the present, Scandinavia has begun a campaign of aggressive expansion in the region. Scandinavia proposes to protect and aid Danzig from foreign threats, naturally a blatant excuse to occupy and annex the defenseless city. Danizg is rightfully fearful, and has called on us to protect and defend them from Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.A;and we shall respond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU14.B;Should we really anger Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.T;The Danzig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.D;To our dismay $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared its intention to defend Danzig against us! Danzig has decided to outright reject our proposal and call on $FROMCOUNTRY$ for help. The Riksdag is furious and our generals call for action against this blatant spit in the face of Scandinavian prestige. We are not sure how committed $FROMCOUNTRY$ is to defending little Danzig from us, but our diplomats suggest ignoring $FROMCOUNTRY$’s announcement and deploying a marine detachment to “protect” the city before $FROMCOUNTRY$ sends its forces to secure it completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.A;We’ll sail on Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU15.B;This provocation is beneath us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.T;The Danzig Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.D;Scandinavia has ignored our declaration of protection, and went so far as deploying a marine detachment to occupy the city! Danzig will not be able to stop the marines from seizing the city, ignoring this threat will surely mean that Danzig, if not the whole of Prussia will fall under Scandinavian control! Our military staff implore us to send our cavalry to the city as quickly as possible to intercept this threat and secure Danzig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.A;We’ll ride to Danzig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU16.B;This could end badly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.T;The Battle of Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.D;Our biggest fear has come true, our marines were intercepted by cavalry from $FROMCOUNTRY$ in an attempt to stop our advance on the city. Our brave marines have set camp on shore now, and are preparing for a final assault on the city. The situation is tense, as our marines appear to be superior in combat ability, while $FROMCOUNTRY$’s cavalry has the advantage of controlling the battlefield and maneuverability. This could go either way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU17.A;Storm the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#### Lithuania Startup Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.T;What is a Lithuanian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.D;The identity of what it means to be a Lithuanian has increasingly become contested among our people. Lithuania has been dominated by the Ruthenian Litvins, who have assumed the mantle of Lithuanian identity for themselves, much to the dislike of an emerging Lithuanian middle class who holds themselves as the only true Baltic Lithuanian, and the one whose traditions and language should be represented in Lithuania. Now this battle of words has been carried into the university of Vilnius, where the new Lithuanian movement argues for the representation of the Baltic Lithuanian people against the Litvin and Polish nobility, and the spread of the Lithuanian language in the Grand Duchy’s institutions. This is contrasted by the conservative Litvin nobility, who view themselves as the true representation of Lithuania. The Baltic Lithuanian movement has begun circulating nationalist material, promoting the Lithuanian language and rejecting the Litvin claim of the Grand Duchy. Tensions between the groups are reaching their breaking point in the university...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU18.A;One Lithuania, two people;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.T;Ban on Lithuanian material;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.D;Following the boom in Baltic Lithuanian literature in the University of Vilnius, the Litvin establishment has begun banning various pieces of Lithuanian literature involving the Lithuanian language and promotion of a new Baltic Lithuanian identity. This action has naturally caused outrage within the Lithuanians in Vilnius, and triggered a series of protests and threats of violence throughout the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU19.A;One Lithuania, one people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.T;The University of Vilnius bans Lithuanian literature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.D;Unrest has recently surged throughout Vilnius, as middle class Baltic Lithuanians have begun to espouse their will for true Lithuanian representation in the Grand Duchy and the University of Vilnius. This movement was met with opposition from the traditional Ruthenian Litvins, who view themselves as the true and legitimate Lithuanian ideal. As a result, Baltic Lithuanian material in the University has been banned by its Litvin administration as an attempt to curb this movement. However, only time could tell if this move had a desirable effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU20.A;Surely not worth our attention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.T;The Lithuanian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.D;Unrest in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania grows as the Baltic Lithuanian movement reaches new heights. Liberal intellectuals in Samogitia travel through its cities, establishing unions and clubs to promote what they dub as “The Lithuanian Revival”, in the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe Ruthenian Litvins of Lithuania have slowly grown in numbers and influence throughout the history of Poland-Lithuania, and now they hold a firm grasp on the Grand Duchy and dominate its aristocratic class. Now the two sides clash with each other, each with one uncompromising stance on what a Lithuanian is, unable to recognize each other’s culture and way of life as anything other than deviancy and distortion of their culture. Reconciliation seems impossible, and unfortunately due to our political position, intervention seems even less likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU21.A;This used to be a whole lot more simple...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#### Partition of Lithuania Chain ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.T;The fate of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is disintegrated, and now Russia has the opportunity to surge westwards against those who have spent the last centuries immiserating our people. We may decide the fate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the declining appendage that only managed to survive this far because of Warsaw.\n\nOur treaty with Scandinavia still stands, and we may curve the little Lithuanian state into pieces, Scandinavia will receive Samogitia, while we receive the rest. This arrangement is definitely valuable, but many in $CAPITAL$ believe that we are in a far stronger position than Scandinavia, and that it would be far more easy to simply snatch Lithuania by forming an alliance with it, forcing it into a status of a client state. We should, however, expect Scandinavia’s wrath should we choose to march on Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.A;We will take the whole of Lithuania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU22.B;We must adhere to the treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.T;The fate of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is disintegrated, and now Russia has the opportunity to surge westwards against those who have spent the last centuries immiserating our people. We may decide the fate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the declining appendage that only managed to survive this far because of Warsaw.\n\nOur treaty with Scandinavia still stands, and we may curve the little Lithuanian state into pieces, Scandinavia will receive Samogitia, while we receive the rest. This is another step in the advancement of Russia into the status of world power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU23.A;Let us move on to Lithuania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.T;The end of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.D;The sun sets one final time on Lithuania. From the west, Scandinavia is approaching to fulfil its Baltic dream of domination, and Lithuania is just another piece of that dream. On the east, the ever growing Russian empire is approaching with dreams of expansion in every cardinal direction. The two powers naturally saw each other as friends when dealing with our fledgling state, and have decided to carve Lithuania among themselves: Scandinavia taking Samogitia, and Russia taking the rest.\n\nHowever, not everyone in Lithuania was ready to see their homeland go. The military has seized Vilnius, and began to fortify it, pooling resources from every nook and cranny in a last desperate bid to save Lithuania. We don’t know how the two invaders will react, but we know it couldn’t be too friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU24.A;Hold... the... line...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.T;The partition of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.D;Now is the time to move on Lithuania, another patch of our imperial ambition. Russia is already prepared to take its end of the deal, now it’s only left for us to take Samogitia and put this ugly product of the Commonwealth to an end. Our marines are ready for the occupation, as we expect it to be nothing short than a short parade across the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU25.A;A smooth operation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.T;Vilnius defies the partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.D;A surprising turn of events unfolds in Lithuania, as one final piece of the country refused to turn over and die. A group of officers have come together in Vilnius to declare open resistance against our partition. Declaring that the Lithuanian dream will not be snuffed out. We are now in an awkward situation, as both us and our co-partitioner are ready to pounce on Vilnius, a valuable region and city that is definitely worth a little bloodshed over. But only one of us could hope to seize it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU26.A;Get the cavalry! Take Vilnius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.T;The Russian saviour;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, promising us an alliance against Scandinavain aggression. We naturally know the true nature of this envoy: the end of Lithuanian independence. Flanked on both sides by aggressive powers, we have no way of resisting $FROMCOUNTRY$’s sly plot. Some to our dismay even argue that this outcome is preferable, as otherwise we will surely be devoured by both the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ and the Scandinavian beasts. But regardless of the lesser evil, this is surely a sad day for Lithuania...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU27.A;We don’t really have choice, do we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.T;Russia seizes Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.D;To our surprise, the Russians have advanced on Lithuania, despite our ambition in the region. The Russian state has brokered a deal with Lithuania, effectively transforming it to a client state and robbing us of any potential gains in the region. Many of our politicians are furious and demand action against the conniving bear while the military is drafting plans of action. On the other hand, many doubt that the cost of war would be worth a little piece of Lithuania. Whatever our approach may be, we are assured that Lithuania can only be taken through war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.A;And war it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU28.B;War? For Lithuania? Oh, please;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.T;The Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.D;Our government will not let this act of Russian aggression stand. Our forces are preparing to set out to punish Russia for its treachery and retrieve what’s rightfully ours! And This time, we’ll take far more than Samogitia! Our diplomats are ready to hand Russia our formal declaration of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU29.A;They’ll regret crossing us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.T;Victory in the Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.D;We have crushed Scandinavia feeble attempt to grab what’s ours! The whole of Lithuania is now under Russian control, and our hold over the Baltic is stronger than ever. Now that Scandinavia has been dealt with, there is no need to keep up the illusion of Russian protection over the little Baltic state. Lithuania will be annexed into our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU30.A;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.T;Victory in the Lithuanian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.D;We have crushed Russia’s forces, proving that their only way of challenging our might is through treachery. The whole of Lithuania is now under Scandinavian control, and our hold over the Baltic sea is stronger than ever. Scandinavia now stands ascendant in eastern Europe, and any Polish, or Russian attempt to challenge our presence will be dealt with a severe hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU31.A;Scandinavia’s interests are secured;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.T;Scandinavia backs off;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.D;Upon seizing Lithuania for ourselves, we expected at least some form of Scandinavian resistance. To our surprise, Scandinavia has run with its tails between its legs, leaving us with the whole of Lithuania in our hands. There’s no point in continuing this Lithuanian charade after the threat of Scandinavia has evaporated, we may fully annex this little puppet into our state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU32.A;A glorious day for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.T;The Lithuanian Scheme;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.D;Our diplomats are ready to contact Lithuania and offer it our protection. With this move, Lithuania will be made into a puppet state. As we are well aware, Lithuania is in no state to refuse our demands. Our top priority now should be to expect Scandinavia’s response rather than Lithuania’s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU33.A;A glorious day for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.T;The Unification of Ruthenia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.D;With the collapse of the Lithuanian State, our diplomats have been proposing a union with the newly formed state of Belarus for the intended purpose of unifying the Ruthenians against any major threat to the east or west. $COUNTRY$ of course will naturally lead this union so there is no reason not to attempt such a union, at least if it occurs without the denial of Belarus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU34.A;Let see if this is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.T;The Malorussian-Belarussian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.D;With the collapse of the Lithuanian State, we have been engaged with Malorussian diplomats who have come to us with the proposition of creating a Ruthenian Confederation between both Malorussia and Belarus. There are many in Belarus who see this union as giving too much to the Malorussians and diluting our Litvin heritage but they are a vocal minority compared to the far majority of people who see this union as the only way to protect our people against the Russian or Polish Menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.A;We accept this union between brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.B;We accept this union between brothers (Player Only);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU35.C;We will never accept a deal with the Malorussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.T;The Unification of Belarus and Malorussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.D;The Belarusian and Malorussian governments have come to a agreement in regards to the creation of a confederation between both Malorussia and Belarus in perpetuity, with the intent to defend the interests of both states against both Russian and Polish aggression. There have also been additional talks in regards to the creation of a greater Ruthenian state that could be created if this union between brothers covered all Ruthenian lands but that may only remain theoretical for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU36.A;This is the only way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU37.T;Unification Denied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LITPRU37.D;The Belarusian government has disagreed with the sentiments of the Malorussian government in regards to the creation of a unified Ruthenian state. The only way that the Ruthenian peoples could be unified now is by the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC_smolensk_title;Reconquer Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC_smolensk_desc;Smolensk, the gateway between central Russia and Lithuania, has been coveted by Polish and Lithuanian kings for generations, always a battleground between us and the Russian princes. The Principality arose in 1612 from the Treaty of Warsaw, when the Bohemian Kings imposed a Jagiellon over the territories which had rebelled alongside the rest of Central Russia, but which Poland had managed to reconquer in exchange for the Jagiellons forsaking their claims to the Polish-Lithuanian Crown. For 200 years, the principality has stood against all odds, but this ended with the revolution of 1839. Now that Muscovy has been shattered, Smolensk is ripe for the taking. We will not make the same mistakes as past rulers who sought to bind Smolensk with loose arrangements of vassalage. They must become our new northeastern frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
reintegrate_lithuania_title;Reintegrate Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
reintegrate_lithuania_desc;The Lithuanian magnates reacted poorly to our reforms, failing to understand that such measures were necessary for the salvation of the Commonwealth. For a time it seemed as though they would secede entirely and cause the union’s collapse. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, but they will not return to the fold through persuasion alone. Let us embark on a campaign of pressuring Lithuanian magnates to sell off their estates to us in order to deprive them of their influence - most of their lands are already insolvent anyway, and we will be paying a higher price than they would normally obtain for them. This will not be cheap, but it will allow us to draw Lithuania back into our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The scale of this endeavor is such that even if we swoop in on the organizers in the city proper, they will simply relocate. We cannot allow Ruthenian nationalism to boil over!

create_provisional_constitution_desc;A complete legal overhaul of the Commonwealth is currently beyond our power. However, we can impose limited reforms through the royal dictatorship. This provisional constitution will protect freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, while eliminating Polish literacy tests for voting and mandating that all ballots be private. We will also appoint Józef Skrzetuski, leader of the liberals, as Chancellor. This is a desperate act, but change must begin somewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

When that glorious day arrives, we shall be transformed into a true great power - and we will at last possess the power and solid political footing to shape eastern Europe in our image. §BThe urban bourgeoisie, especially the Jews, want a liberal constitution : the monarchists want a conservative one : the military wants an even more conservative one.

So far, they have bent over backwards to appease the Ruthenians and avert a rebellion. Yet a Commonwealth in chaos would be a great opportunity for us.

Their cruelty and penchant for slavery and destruction are legendary.

While in the past they were a useful if untrustworthy safeguard against the Tatars, now they must accept their place within modern Europe.

PLCN1.T;The Sejm of 1845;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN1.D;King Stanislaw’s reign has not been fruitful. The magnates, not just in Poland proper but in the outlying regions which supposedly pay him homage, continue to conspire against the throne. If the King is to bring about his vision of a united Commonwealth, ready to face the future, then he can no longer be bound by the odious “Golden Liberties.” He is mindful that many junior officers within the Polish military as well as the urban bourgeoisie loathe the szlachta and their entrenched privileges. Some of the more paranoid nobles have spread rumors that the Sejm of 1845 is a trap, and that Stanislaw will, upon its opening, launch a military coup d’etat in the name of crushing plots against the Crown, and lay the groundwork for a permanent, parliamentary Sejm based on a modern constitution instead of medieval documents. If so, then the lands beyond the Polish heartland will surely look to outside powers to protect them from the King’s ambitions. Are the rumors true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN1.A;”Officers, seize these traitors in the name of the Crown!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN2.T;Prussia Seeks Scandinavian Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN2.D;The first casualty of Stanislaw’s assumption of dictatorial authority was Prussia. Ever since the first Prussian Homage of 1525 which transformed the old Order State of the Teutonic Knights into the Duchy of Prussia as a Polish vassal, some have seen this arrangement as the equivalent of clutching a viper to our breast. Those fears have been borne out, as the Prussian Balters, steeped in feudalism, are terrified at Stanislaw’s assault upon noble privilege. Thus they have sought Scandinavia’s protection against us, and Copenhagen has obliged, proclaiming Prussia’s annexation! Scandinavian troops have been welcomed with open arms by the Balters, and Scandinavia, keen to dominate the Baltic, will surely not stop at annexing Ducal Prussia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Those fears have been borne out, as the Prussian Balters, steeped in feudalism, are terrified at Stanislaw’s assault upon noble privilege. Thus, in an ostentatious ceremony in Konigsberg, Duke of Prussia Ruprecht II von Wettin has declared Prussia’s independence! All forces of the Commonwealth are being driven from the rebellious duchy, and while it is unlikely to survive on its own, it may have greater ambitions…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN4.T;Formation of the Czestochowa Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN4.D;The szlachta of the Commonwealth are nothing if not persistent. After Stanislaw abruptly ended the Sejm of 1845 by arresting many of the nobles in attendance and declaring his intention to abolish the old laws in favor of primogeniture succession and a permanent, parliamentary Sejm, magnates from throughout the realm gathered at the fortress in Czestochowa, on the German border. There they have proclaimed Stanislaw’s actions to be illegal, and have formed a konfederacja (confederation), the type of military association which has periodically arisen throughout Polish history. This Czestochowa Confederation seeks the overthrow of King Stanislaw by any means necessary. The great nations of Europe have declared their support for the Confederation, condemning Stanislaw as a crazed radical. In the midst of this treason, the Uman Confederation has also broken ties with the Commonwealth, though they have not pledged support to the magnates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN4.A;The rats huddle together, and the vultures circle above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN5.T;Rise of the Czestochowa Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN5.D;The Polish magnates have reacted to Stanislaw establishing a royal dictatorship at the Sejm of 1846 by forming the Czestochowa Confederation and seeking Bohemia’s help in ousting Stanislaw. With war brewing, the Ruthenian nobles have convened their own rada and decided to declare neutrality in the conflict. We shall not aid any of Poland’s enemies, but neither shall we shed our blood for their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN5.A;Ruthenians must protect Ruthenians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN6.T;Standoff With the Czestochowa Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN6.D;As we had feared, the traitorous szlachta of the Czestochowa Confederation are seeking outside aid for their insurrection. We believe that Prague and Copenhagen are both considering intervention. The Czestochowa Confederation has likely promised them economic and even territorial concessions if they assist in ousting King Stanislaw. Yet there is hope. The Czestochowa Confederation is rumored to be rife with factionalism, with its nobles already falling into bickering with one another. It is likely that if we prolong the standoff with the Confederation for long enough then they will collapse in on themselves. The real danger is that foreign powers may preemptively intervene in their name. We must be cautious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN6.A;Their fall cannot come soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN7.T;The Czestochowa Confederation Seeks Aid Against Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN7.D;King Stanislaw of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has declared a royal dictatorship with the support of junior army officers and the urban bourgeoisie. His main aim is to destroy the power of the nobility and their “Golden Liberties”. In response, the magnates have declared his actions to be illegal and have banded together to form the Czestochowa Confederation, a military association aiming to overthrow Stanislaw. The Confederation has now appealed to Emperor Sigismund for assistance against the rogue king. Our representative in Poland, recently recalled, has warned us that the Czestochowa Confederation holds little actual strength, and that its nobles spend more time bickering with each other than making war plans. Chancellor von Schwartzenberg has for once been the voice of action, urging Sigismund to uphold the aristocratic order in Europe and put down the “liberal demagogue at the door.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN7.A;Of course we shall stand with these honorable men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN7.B;We are not in a position to participate in this feud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN9.T;The Germans Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN9.D;The Czestochowa Confederation has secured the aid of the Jagiellons in their rebellion. We have received word of Emperor Sigismund’s soldiers clashing with Polish border guards across the western frontier. As we struggle to contain the treasonous szlachta, we must also strike down the German invaders as our ancestors have so many times before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN9.A;Onwards to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN10.T;The Germans Declare Neutrality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN10.D;We have received welcome news from the west - Emperor Sigismund has declared that he will not offer any military support to the Czestochowa Confederation. The rebellious szlachta had staked high hopes upon German intervention, and must surely be distraught at this news. We must not lower our guard - we have reason to believe that the Scandinavians may still intervene in support of the Confederation. Yet the lack of German support has bolstered Stanislaw’s position amongst the common people, a development which may in turn hasten the collapse of the traitors’ designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN10.A;Good news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN11.T;An Opportunity in the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN11.D;King Stanislaw of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has declared a royal dictatorship with the support of junior army officers and the urban bourgeoisie. His main aim is to destroy the power of the nobility, who have long enjoyed unparalleled privileges. In response, the magnates have declared his actions to be illegal and have banded together to form the Czestochowa Confederation, a military association created to overthrow Stanislaw. While many have speculated that the Confederation would reach out to us for support, this has not in fact occurred. However, given the Commonwealth’s great weakness at this moment, we could use the chaos to seize Royal Prussia (including the port city of Danzig through which nearly all of the Commonwealth’s commerce flows) and the province of Klajpeda, both of which contain influential Balter populations in need of our…protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN11.A;We must not leave the Balters helpless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN11.B;This seems quite dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN12.T;Scandinavia Seizes Klajpeda!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN12.A;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN13.T;Scandinavia Occupies the Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN13.D;We had suspected that the Czestochowa Confederation would court Scandinavian intervention. Now Scandinavian forces, in the name of “protecting the Balter populations of Memelburg and Pomerelia,” have invaded Royal Prussia and coastal Lithuania! The Balters of both regions have reportedly welcomed them with open arms, though the peasants have already begun to resist the occupiers. Most painful of all has been the loss of Gdansk, our main trade port, without which our economy will suffer. Strangely, the Czestochowa Confederation has condemned Scandinavia’s actions, suggesting that Copenhagen did not in fact act alongside them. In any case, we cannot address this grave attack upon our sovereignty - for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN13.A;We will deal with them in time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN14.T;Collapse of the Czestochowa Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN14.D;The szlachta were traitors until the end. When it became clear that they could not challenge King Stanislaw, they fell into infighting. Our forces arrived to find them battling each other! After crushing them, our men brought their leaders to Warsaw, where they met Stanislaw, seated upon his throne. Each of them personally laid their battle standards before him. The king then exiled them all, forcing them to sign over their property to the Crown and warning the traitors that they would be executed if they ever returned. This has triggered a general purge of the Polish nobility, with estates across the kingdom seized for redistribution to the people. The Polish commoners, once outraged by Stanislaw’s royal dictatorship, have been wooed by this marvelous show of strength. The Uman Confederation remains estranged, something the King must change in order for his plans to come to fruition. If Stanislaw and his strange coalition of monarchists, junior military officers, and the Warsaw bourgeoisie can win the trust of the Lithuanians and the Ruthenians, then perhaps the Commonwealth will at last become a united nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN14.A;Pro Fide, Lege et Rege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC21.T;The End of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC21.D;The Constitutionalists have been defeated by the combined forces of the Magnates and foreign powers who were not content with a strong Commonwealth thriving and its people freed! The Rzeczpospolita has been torn apart, the king Stanislaw Habsburski exiled along with other great Liberal figures. Now the Jagiellons of Prague have annexed western Poland while putting a cadet of their family on the throne of 'Poland', the first in 300 years. Little Poland has been reorganized as the duchy of Galicia with its capital in Kraków, while the Baltic coast has also been taken from Poland with Lithuania now a Scandinavian puppet. The only winners of this terrible treaty are the Ruthenians who have been given most of their claims in exchange for staying out of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC21.A;This day will be known as a day of infamy for generations to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN15.T;The Future of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN15.D;The curtailing of the Czestochowa Confederation has destroyed the szlachta’s power within Poland proper. However, Lithuania and Ruthenia remain contested. Serfdom is at the heart of the matter - the Lithuanian nobility is fiercely devoted to their estates, and emancipating the serfs would turn them against us. The Ruthenian nobility meanwhile is under threat. In the aftermath of the Confederation’s fall, Uman Confederation Voivode Wiktor Potocki was removed from power by a conspiracy of haydamaks, armed bands of commoners and landless nobles, which is now spreading into the Ruthenian lands of Poland and Lithuania. These groups demand the end of serfdom, cultural protections for Ruthenians, and most disturbingly of all, “redistribution” of Ruthenian Jewish wealth. We must find a way to unite the Commonwealth without sundering it instead. §RIf we press either the Lithuanians or the Ruthenians too far, then they may not only rebel against us, but enlist foreign aid in their rebellion.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN15.A;Stanislaw will lead us upon the narrow and righteous path to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN16.T;The Question of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN16.D;Perhaps no other institution is so hated by the ordinary people of the Commonwealth as is serfdom. The hatred of the Polish and Lithuanian nobility for their own subjects is infamous, to the point that some magnates believe themselves to be descended from the ancient Sarmatians as they cannot imagine being related to those they rule over! Needless to say, the Ruthenians have for many years sought an end to serfdom, with Haydamaks launching raids against nobles across the Ruthenian lands. King Stanislaw now has the power to abolish serfdom by royal decree, without exceptions, and without compensation to the nobles. This would of course outrage the remaining magnates of the east, especially in Lithuania, but Stanislaw’s advisors assure him that the abolition of serfdom is an absolute necessity for our nation’s future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN16.A;Announce to the people that the person subject to any lord is liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN16.B;Lithuania’s loyalty is more important than the Ruthenians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN17.T;The Question of Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN17.D;Polish kings have tried to Catholicize the Ruthenians since before the personal union with Lithuania was ever formed, leading to the growth of the Uniates. This has enraged the Haydamaks, who loathe the encroachment of the Catholic Church, especially the Jesuits, who they see as conspiratorial villains. While religious freedom is in theory already guaranteed within the Commonwealth, creating firmer protections for Eastern Orthodox churches and halting Catholic missionary activity in the east would calm Ruthenian fears of Polonization. The only problem is that this would enrage Polish reactionaries, who would accuse Stanislaw of wavering in his commitment to the Catholic faith. §RYet ignoring the demands of the haydamaks could drive them into open rebellion if they feel their grievances will not be addressed.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN17.A;The Catholicization of the east must come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN17.B;The Catholic Church is by definition universal, end of discussion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN18.T;The Question of Jewish-Christian Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN18.D;The Commonwealth is renowned as one of the only safe havens for the Jews, besides certain cities like Salonica. Yet the Ruthenians are enormously suspicious of the Jews. This has intensified as the magnates have invited Jews to move to their estates, draining Jewish artisanal and merchant talents from urban areas to fuel noble wealth without reinvesting it into the community. The result has been the steady impoverishment of eastern towns as well as mounting hatred of Jews, whom Ruthenians have accused of stealing the people’s money through usury and other schemes. Haydamaks have begun to assault Jewish merchants to “find” the money which they allege was “stolen” from the Ruthenian people! Crown representatives have made contact with some of the most influential haydamak leaders, who have proposed the annulment of all debts held by Ruthenians to any Jewish lender. §RWe must remember that many of the influential liberals drafting the constitution are Jewish, and this “jubilee” would destroy our support amongst them.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN18.A;If it will quiet Ruthenian suspicions…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN18.B;This is absurd! The Jews did not cause these problems!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN19.T;The East Withdraws Once More;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN19.D;The haydamaks have lost patience with Stanislaw and his refusal to accommodate their demands. All contact with Kijów has been lost, as border crossings from Poland and Lithuania into the Ruthenian lands have been blockaded by armed Ruthenian guards in patched-together uniforms. The Uman Confederation, so long a sword of Damocles above the Commonwealth, has finally fallen upon us. The growth of the haydamaks has made the Confederation stronger than ever before.. The only reason it has not burst into open rebellion is that the Ruthenians of the east and west have yet to agree upon a single leader or a coherent political vision. When they do so, however, there will be dire consequences for the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN19.A;We will stay vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN20.T;Dissolution of the Uman Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN20.D;After months upon months of negotiations with the most influential haydamak leaders, we have convinced the Ruthenians to reintegrate into the Commonwealth. Our reforms have allayed their fears of Polish supremacy and the nationalist hardliners amongst them have been pushed to the margins. To be sure, Ruthenian nationalism is a concept which will never truly fade, but the Ruthenian faith in the Commonwealth project has been rekindled. We can only hope that it is a sign of things to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN20.A;Welcome back, countrymen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN21.T;The Naval Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN21.D;We will never be truly sovereign without a major port of our own. Such a harbor is necessary both for economic and military reasons. Gdansk served this purpose for centuries, but its recent capture by Scandinavia has strangled our economy. There is an obvious attraction in liberating Gdansk, but it would mean fighting a great power, and our military may not be ready for such a confrontation. There is an alternative. Khadjibey, located on the Black Sea coast, possesses an excellent natural harbor - and was once known as Kotsiubijiv when it was first settled by Ruthenians in ages past. Whatever one calls it, the port may be a simpler target than Gdansk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The king mounted a white horse at the head of his personal uhlan guard, thronged by cheering crowds as he made his way to the seashore. The main point of the ceremony was marked by a Roman Catholic service, with a sermon told by Reverend Michal Pazdan. At its conclusion, the King cast one of the rings into the sea, the other being fitted onto a velvet glove bearing the Commonwealth’s coat of arms, to symbolize marriage between the ocean and the nation. The flag of the Navy was blessed, and then, to the salvo of 21 guns, it was raised on a mast by sailors Tadeusz Jaruzelski and Edward Baclawski.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN24.T;The Union of Warsaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN24.D;King Stanislaw promised that the royal dictatorship would be ended once a new constitution had been finished, and now he has made good on his promise. This new constitution, known as the Union of Warsaw, has been signed and ratified by representatives from all of the provinces. This liberal document establishes significant civil rights, reduces the monarch to a ceremonial figure, and reinforces existing religious freedoms. The greatest change is its new federal system which has merged Poland and Lithuania into a single united nation, with each province granted its own legislature. Finally, the Sejm has been remodeled into a western European style parliament. The peoples of the Commonwealth, especially the Jews, have cheered the end of Polonization and the start of a truly multiethnic state. The ambitions of such a behemoth can only be guessed at, but all of Europe must now reckon with a Commonwealth reborn, a Commonwealth united and ready for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Its new constitution, known as the Union of Warsaw, has been signed and ratified by representatives from all of the provinces. This document has established welfare and school systems, as well as ending child labor. Its new federal model has merged Poland and Lithuania into a single nation. Finally, the sejm, long derided by monarchists as an unsalvageable institution, has been abolished. In its place the constitution has ratified the royal dictatorship, vesting absolute power in the monarch, and replacing elective succession with primogeniture. The Commonwealth has been reforged into a truly multiethnic state, though only at the cost of ending any immediate hopes of democracy. All of Europe must now reckon with a Commonwealth reborn, a Commonwealth united and ready to manifest Stanislaw’s even grander dreams for the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN26.T;The Assassination of Stanislaw Habsburski;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN26.D;King Stanislaw’s royal dictatorship made him enemies even beyond the magnates. The government, being devoted to realizing his political projects, left many people dissatisfied. One such man was Gabriel Pieracki. Pieracki had been a painter before being drafted into the army, where he lost a hand and an eye during a bombardment. He appealed first for an extended pension, and second for a government job, as he could not find work. Denied both, he blamed Stanislaw for ruining his life. This vendetta climaxed when King Stanislaw inaugurated the opening of the Royal Warsaw Museum of Fine Arts, which had declined to exhibit Pieracki’s works. He slipped in and made his way to the main chamber, where Stanislaw was viewing Jan Lorentz’s newest painting, “The Prussian Homage.” Pieracki emerged from the crowd, drew forth his old service pistol, and shot the king dead! Stanislaw’s death leaves the constitution unfinished, and has ended any attempts to establish a controlled Sejm. Dark days are ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Stanislaw’s death had left a power vacuum within which there was no chance to restrain the restive factions in the east. The nullification of the Union of Lublin will likely embolden the haydamaks of Ruthenia to take action as well. This may be the end of the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN28.T;Committee for the Abolition of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN28.D;Liberal activists, once a rare breed within the Commonwealth, have grown in number as of late. The leading liberal grievance is serfdom, an old and much-loathed institution and the foundation of the szlachta’s power. Now a group in Warsaw has formed to agitate for its end. The Committee for the Abolition of Serfdom boasts a wide range of members, cutting across religious and cultural lines, though led by urban Polish intellectuals. King Stanislaw has expressed sympathy for the Committee’s goal, but has refused to offer open support for serfdom’s abolition. This leaves the monarchists and the liberals at loggerheads with one another - two groups which are ostensibly his allies. The longer that the Committee goes unheard, the more agitated its members will become.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN29.D;”Nie pozwalam! Nie pozwalam!”\n\n”I do not allow!” That horrid phrase has been grinding into Stanislaw’s mind with each sitting of the Sejm. It is the liberum veto, a parliamentary device by which any deputy can instantly end the current session and void any measures passed during it. With nearly five hundred deputies at each session, all of them keen to protect their privileges, the result has been Stanislaw struggling like Sisyphus against the collective inertia of the szlachta. In his private moments, the king is growing hateful of the magnates, of the so-called “Golden Liberties” which they cower behind to hide from even the shadow of reform. He knows many junior officers in the army are reformists like himself, and loathe their noble commanders for skimming their pay. Perhaps they would support a military coup d’etat to create a royal dictatorship - strictly in the interest of ushering in reform and breaking the szlachta’s power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN290.D;The Ruthenians have for many years felt abused and neglected, both by the Poles and the Lithuanians. The Ruthenian lands have always been rowdy, but the rise of the Uman Confederation at the dawn of the century was a sharp escalation of this tendency. The continuing impoverishment of the eastern lands due to economic migrations to urban areas has given rise to a dangerous trend. Haydamaks, armed bands of commoners and landless nobles, are forming in the Ruthenian lands, emboldened by similar groups in the Uman Confederation. So far they have confined themselves to raiding noble estates, Jewish merchants, and Catholic priests, supposedly on behalf of “the people,” though most are just as likely to keep their loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This is a dangerous development : if the haydamaks become animated not by general economic grievance but by nationalist zeal, they could transform into a separatist army. The king’s advisors are urging him to establish an autonomous “Ruthenian Territory” which would in theory enlarge the Uman Confederation without actually shifting the Commonwealth’s administrative borders. Others warn that such measures would only delay the inevitable, and that we should instead prepare for a confrontation with the Ruthenians. §RAllowing the haydamaks to become radicalized through our inaction could very well make such views a self-fulfilling prophecy.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Thus the two hands of Ruthenia, one of the artist, the other of the citizen-soldier, are clasped together in eternal brotherhood. At the formation of the new All-Ruthenian National Congress in the Kyiv Gymnasium, Volodymyr Doroshenko, eldest son of the family which once led the Zaporozhian Sich (the last true Ruthenian nation before its conquest by Ryazan and the Sloboda Ukrainians), has been elected Hetman of our armed forces.

Preposterous notions of “Halyczynian” and “Litvin” nationhood have infected these communities, outgrowths of the Ruthenian nationalist epidemic.

PLCN40.D;”Other men are the carving knife and serving dish : we are the fish and the meat.” - Józef Brzezinski, Polish author\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has never lacked enemies. Now, all of its old foes have fallen upon it at once. The Ruthenian revolution and its newly-minted army led by Hetman Volodymyr Doroshenko has torn the nation apart. Across central Europe, neighboring realms have plunged their own knives into the Commonwealth’s back. Whether in the name of supporting the Ruthenians, safeguarding certain minorities, or simply to “restore stability to the continent,” they have invaded the Commonwealth from all directions. Not since the Great German War has a European state been under such a devastating assault on so many fronts. If the Commonwealth can survive such an onslaught - such a great deluge - then it will be forever remembered as a truly immortal nation. If it does not, then it shall be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN41.D;The King of the Commonwealth, after learning of his armies’ latest defeat, summoned the most pro-war deputies of the Sejm for a private meeting at his fortified hunting lodge. Neither he nor his guests ever arrived. Where they went - whether they perished in a natural disaster or were assassinated by foreign agents - does not matter now. The Commonwealth is coming undone : it could not survive Ruthenia’s secession. German forces in Poznan have convened a rump Sejm that has abolished the Commonwealth and restored an independent Poland under German protection. The anti-Commonwealth coalition’s representatives are convening in Warsaw to allocate areas of occupation, and splinter states arising from the ambitions of local elites are already falling under their influence.\n\n§RThough she struggled and labored mightily, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is now lost. Perhaps this time forever.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN42.D;”Whenever kingship approaches tyranny it is near its end, for by this it becomes ripe for division, change of dynasty, or total destruction…” - Nicole Oresme, ‘De Moneta’\n\nKing Stanislaw was mortal after all, unable to overcome either Ruthenia or its foreign allies. The war brought him only failure, and suffering for his people. This catastrophe could not be accepted by the common people, who, after learning of the Commonwealth’s surrender, stormed the Royal Castle in Warsaw. Stanislaw was dragged before a “people’s Sejm” in the city center, where the mob voted to condemn the king to death for his despotism, and mocked Stanislaw by asking if he intended to invoke the liberum veto. The king, defiant to the end, was then Damoclined. The military ended this anarchy, proclaiming a republic led by a retired general, who has negotiated with the coalition to draw up an eastern Europe without a Commonwealth - a Commonwealth which is now lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN42.A;There is nothing more to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN43.T;The Treaty of Kraków;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN43.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fought with everything she had, to the point of national exhaustion, and denied the enemy coalition total victory - but they won a victory nonetheless. With the Sejm threatening to oust the king, he was forced to turn to the military to preserve order. This has served the interests of the coalition, who agreed to allow a general purge of the Polish nobility and for its monarchy to continue if the king dissolved the Commonwealth itself. The Union of Lublin has been shattered, replaced with a new, centralized Poland, shorn of feudalism and fueled by Polish nationalism rather than any multicultural tendencies. Order in the east has collapsed as a result, as Ruthenian nationalists are joined by other groups aspiring to nationhood. The Commonwealth may have perished, but Poland is not yet lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN430.T;The Treaty of Kraków;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN430.D;Miraculous! No other word can describe the victory won by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth over her myriad foes. It is a triumph without precedent. The armies of the Commonwealth have vanquished not only the Ruthenian rebels, but all of the foreign empires which dared to raise a hand against the sentinel of eastern Europe. King Stanislaw Habsburski played his new-found glory for all it was worth, demanding that the heads of state of all the defeated nations appear before him in person to sign the peace treaty. Any magnates who aided these enemies have been exiled, their estates seized by the Crown. For the first time in centuries, the Commonwealth breathes freely, safe in the knowledge of her power. If she maintains and multiplies this strength, she may yet grow to become an empire in her own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The resulting peace treaty has confirmed the sovereignty of the Commonwealth, and annulled any pretense of Ruthenian independence. It is a shocking development for a nation that, merely a few years ago, seemed on the verge of collapse. Where those in Lithuania once spoke of a separate destiny from Poland, there is now a renewed commitment to upholding the union - the ongoing hunts for partisans means that the Ruthenians are for now saying little. This victory has by no means transformed the Commonwealth into an empire overnight, but it may well have laid the foundation for its rebirth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN44.T;The Union of Warsaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN44.D;The defeat of both the Ruthenian rebellion and its foreign backers has granted King Stanislaw Habsburski of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth invulnerable fame. This resounding victory has made it difficult to openly criticize the king and his supporters. In light of this, Stanislaw has forced the magnates into line. Some were forgiven in exchange for relinquishing most of their estates and swearing on pain of exile to never take up arms against the Crown. Others were not so fortunate, seized in the middle of the night and banished, their property forfeit. Stanislaw then compelled the surviving magnates to ratify a new constitution, the Union of Warsaw. This document merges Poland and Lithuania into a single nation, with democratic elections and an institutionalized Sejm. All of Europe must now reckon with a Commonwealth reborn, a Commonwealth united and ready for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The purging of rebellious Ruthenian elites has quieted matters in the east, and several magnates of dubious loyalty have been arrested. However, the political situation remains too volatile to conduct an all-out struggle against the szlachta without igniting a civil war within the Polish heartland.

PLCN440.T;An Abrupt Abdication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN440.D;The king had hoped to capitalize upon his wartime victory to build up his personal reputation. Alas, the people of the Commonwealth were not so forgiving. Our monarch is in truth not the most charismatic man, his talents more fitted to currying political favor amongst the elite rather than the middle or lower classes. There are even dark rumors that the king had contacted sympathetic German elites in the west to establish plans to keep his power should the Commonwealth have been destroyed. These allegations, though lacking hard evidence, still turned most of the Polish middle class against the monarch. The military ended the discussion when top officers met with the king last night and informed him that they could no longer guarantee his safety, not from revolutionaries or from the magnates. This morning the king announced his abdication, and the Sejm will soon be convened to elect a successor. The szlachta seem oddly fearful of this…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN440.A;We can only hope that his replacement will be superior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN46.T;Ruthenian Magnates Demand a Third Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN46.D;The Ruthenian nobility is no longer satisfied by our concessions. We have received a petition - or rather an ultimatum - signed by dozens of influential Ruthenian lords. It demands the immediate elevation of the Ruthenian domain to a true third kingdom within the Commonwealth, and full control of eastern Poland and Lithuania! The petition has further demanded that the Ruthenian magnates be allowed to elect their own king without Warsaw’s input, and that Eastern Orthodox Christianity be recognized as its official religion. All of this is of course unacceptable! It would destroy any possibility of uniting the Commonwealth. The king and his cabinet wasted no time in rejecting this impertinent nonsense. Yet the Ruthenians refused to back down, and have formed haydamaks, armed bands of commoners and minor nobles, in defiance of Warsaw. They may take drastic measures to advance their chauvinist goals, and we can only hope that they do not draw in foreign powers…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN47.T;Failure of the Petition of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN47.D;A petition had been drafted by a Rada of Ruthenian lords to demand the immediate elevation of the Ruthenian domain to a true third Kingdom within the Commonwealth. This is far from a novel idea, its foundations being centuries old, nor is it the first attempt. We thought it the height of generosity on part - after all, we only wanted a king for ourselves, and religious freedom. Yet Warsaw rejected the petition out of hand! Clearly their goals remain the Polonization of Ruthenia. Something must be done - something drastic, something to mobilize not merely the magnates of Ruthenia but the whole of its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The League of the Archangel Michael, a Ruthenian nationalist society named for the patron of Kijów, has come out of the shadows, and convened a conference of Ruthenian nobles, intellectuals, and haydamak hetmans at the Kijów Royal Gymnasium. There the participants joined forces and formed the All-Ruthenian National Congress. Volodymyr Doroshenko was elected Hetman of the Congress’ armed forces. The Commonwealth now faces its darkest hour, as Ruthenian militias spring up across the east and seize control of the autonomous government. The loss of Ruthenia will surely invite all of its old foes to partake in the chaos - most of all the Russian Bear in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

They first called a meeting of Ruthenian nobles, intellectuals, and haydamak hetmans at the Kijów Royal Gymnasium.

The popularity of this uprising is such that our ambassador suspects that the Commonwealth as a nation is not long for this world. The message also notes that the Germans and the Russians are both believed to be supporting the Ruthenian rebels. War is all but certain to break out across eastern Europe as a result. Thus our government has taken the preemptive step of withdrawing all but the most essential diplomatic personnel from the Commonwealth.

PLCN55.A;This is only the beginning of our resurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN550.T;An Abrupt Abdication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN550.D;The king had hoped to capitalize upon his wartime victory to build up his personal reputation. Alas, the people of the Commonwealth were not so forgiving. Our monarch is in truth not the most charismatic man, his talents more fitted to currying political favor amongst the elite rather than the middle or lower classes. There are even dark rumors that the king had contacted sympathetic German elites in the west to establish plans to keep his power should the Commonwealth have been destroyed. These allegations, though lacking hard evidence, still turned most of the Polish middle class against the monarch. The military ended the discussion when top officers met with the king last night and informed him that they could no longer guarantee his safety, not from revolutionaries or from the magnates. This morning the king announced his abdication, and the Sejm will soon be convened to elect a successor. The szlachta seem oddly fearful of this…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN550.A;We can only hope for a better replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN56.T;The Annexation of West Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,
PLCN56.D;As per the terms agreed upon with the other coalition members after the defeat of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, we have laid claim to West Prussia. This region, also known as Royal Prussia or Pomerelia, is a vital geographical connection between Pomerania and East (or Ducal) Prussia. Unfortunately, while we established a collective agreement to our annexation of West Prussia itself, we were unable to obtain a similar mandate over Danzig. This city has been dominated by Scandinavian mercantile interests for generations, and serves as the economic lifeline for Poland. Thus the “Danzig Question” may complicate our annexation of West Prussia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN56.A;West Prussia is in safe hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN57.T;The Matter of Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN57.D;Our annexation of Danzig opens up the potential to take control of Prussia as well. Danzig is not as vital to Prussia as it is to Poland, but it is still one of the key Balter economic centers. Thus we have the ability to issue an ultimatum to the Prussians to accept our “protection,” like the Balters of Livonia. If they refuse, we shall have no choice but to take control of Prussia in the name of national security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN57.A;Make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN571.T;$FROM_COUNTRY$ Demands our Annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN571.D;$FROM_COUNTRY$ was not satisfied with annexing the city of Danzig. Now they have issued an ultimatum demanding that Prussia accept their “protection!” The terms of this arrangement would be enough to end our sovereignty and reduce us to one of their provinces. If we wish to remain independent, then we must wage our most desperate war yet to defend our freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN571.A;We must accept this fate. (GAME OVER);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN571.B;The children of the Teutonic Knights shall never bow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN572.T;The Matter of Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN572.D;Our annexation of Danzig opens up the potential to take control of Prussia as well. Danzig is not as vital to Prussia as it is to Poland, but it is still one of the key Balter economic centers. Thus we have the ability to issue an ultimatum to the Prussians to accept our “protection,” like the Balters of Livonia. If they refuse, it shall mean war. Yet there is disagreement as to whether we ought to annex Prussia outright. Our foreign minister has proposed installing a client regime within Prussia while keeping it separate from our other territories. §BThis could allow us to use the Balters in Prussia and Livonia to consolidate the southeastern Baltic coast under German hegemony in the future.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN572.A;Prussia must become our eastern frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN572.B;This “Ostland” proposal is most intriguing…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN573.T;$FROM_COUNTRY$ Demands our Submission!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN573.D;$FROM_COUNTRY$ was not satisfied with annexing the city of Danzig. Now they have issued an ultimatum demanding that Prussia accept their “protection!” The terms of this arrangement would be enough to render us a puppet of their nation, though they have made vague promises of assisting us in eastward expansion. If we wish to remain independent, then we must wage our most desperate war yet to defend our freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN573.A;The children of the Teutonic Knights shall never bow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN58.T;Creation of the “Legitimate” Polish Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN58.D;Our forces have secured control over the region of Greater Poland, with the occupation authority’s headquarters located in the city of Posen (or Poznan as the Slavs call it). This has led many civil and military bureaucrats to refer to the entire region as the “Poznan government.” The collapse of the Polish state has given us a chance to fill the resulting void. We have terminated the military government and replaced it with a carefully selected group of Poles, who shall henceforth rule the “legitimate government of Poland” under our control. This has allowed us to continue our occupation in a more discreet fashion. §BIf we can keep control of the Poznan government for long enough then we may be able to eventually annex it.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN58.A;Sicherheit, Freiheit, Gerechtigkeit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN59.T;The Restoration of Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN59.D;The collapse of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has seen local elites declare a reborn Kingdom of Galicia (or Halyczyna, depending on whom you ask). However their regency council has been unable to decide upon a monarch. We are in a position to force the issue in favor of our own Head of State, and have received approval from the anti-Commonwealth coalition to act. While the Galicians have little military to speak of, enforcing direct rule could spark a drawn-out partisan campaign, and moreover may outstrip our bureaucratic capabilities. Therefore we will establish a client regime within Galicia to govern it in our stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN59.A;A useful asset…even if nobody can agree on its name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN60.T;Planning a Second Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN60.D;We have left Poland in an exceptionally weak state after the first partition. Now, we may have a chance to finally dissolve Poland for good with little or no cost to us at all. All we have to do is promise to restore the Polish magnates’ old rights, which they lost in the aftermath of the first partition, if they support a pro-Russian coup d’etat carried out by the Russians which we installed in various Polish ministries after the first war. This should cause enough of a catastrophe to tear the last remnant of the Commonwealth to pieces. Of course, if the coup fails, war will be certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN60.A;Send a letter to the magnates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN61.T;The Coup of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN61.D;When the Treaty of Warsaw stipulated that Russian officials be appointed to various Polish ministries, we knew that it was a pretext to further Russian aggression against us. Now they have made their move. With the assistance of the Russian “military mission in Poland” and embittered aristocrats, they have attempted to seize control of Warsaw! Already, pro-Russian militias are battling with the city police, and our cabinet has urged us to denounce what can only be the start of a full-fledged coup d’etat. While the Polish Army is still strong enough to put down these traitors, doing so would hand Russia a casus belli for what would without question be a war for our very survival as a sovereign state. Yet if the outmatched city police is overwhelmed, the coup will spread its tendrils across Poland, and deliver us into Russian hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN61.A;Poland is not yet lost! Crush the conspirators, Russia be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN61.B;We must accept our place within the Russian sphere…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN62.T;The Polish Miracle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN62.D;In a crushing blow for Russian prestige and an absolute triumph for Poland, Poland and its allies have defeated the Russian Army and prevented the complete destruction of Poland. All Russian officials who were once attached to Polish ministries as part of the Treaty of Warsaw have been expelled from the nation, along with any of the magnates who tried to aid Russia. It seems that Poland is not yet lost, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN62.A;Nie rzucim ziemi, skad nasz ród.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_warsaw_title;Treaty of Warsaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_warsaw_desc;We occupy the entirety of Poland and thus the white eagle has been utterly slain. As its allies have proven themselves completely incapable of defending them, we can immediately declare this war concluded and force the Sejm to sign a treaty with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN63.T;The Final Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN63.D;Through force or intrigue, Russia has placed a sympathetic government in control of Poland. Their first order of business was to open the way for the Russian Army, which today has marched into Warsaw and demanded the complete dissolution of the Polish nation. The shock from the Sejm and the remaining nobility and other elites at this demand has spread chaos across Poland. The Kraków Voivodeship has declared independence as a free republic, and German troops have marched into Poznan to “maintain order” and “secure the rights of Germans in Greater Poland”. What remains of Poland has been made a Russian client state, and only God knows what form it shall assume. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN63.A;Polska zginela.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN64.T;The Lithuanian Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN64.D;The collapse of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has left the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in an unsustainable position. Much of their lands have fallen under our control - except for Vilno, that last glittering jewel which so far lies beyond our reach. Control of this city would greatly strengthen our northern border, but Scandinavia covets it as well. We have reason to believe that the White Ruthenian Army, which remains loyal to the old Lithuanian magnates, has pulled back to Vilno and is preparing for a siege. If we wish to steal a march upon Scandinavia then we must act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN64.A;Vilno will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN65.T;The Grand Duchy in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN65.D;The end of the Commonwealth has shattered the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Ruthenian traitors have seized over half of our nation, reducing us to our holdout in the west. The White Ruthian Army, the last remnants of the Grand Ducal armed forces, have assembled around Vilnius, preparing to hold the city at all costs. We have heard word of both Scandinavia and Ruthenia making plans against us - God willing, we will stand our ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN65.A;Let them come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN66.T;The Lithuanian Situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN66.D;The victory of the Ruthenian rebels has not only shattered the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but also the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in turn. Its eastern lands have been seized by Ruthenia, leaving only a rump state in the west which cannot survive. The White Ruthenian Army (which, despite its name, bears no relation to the rebellion), the last remnant of the Grand Ducal armed forces, is assembling in Wilna to make a stand against the Ruthenians. If we can steal a march on the Slavs, we can capture Wilna for ourselves, and complete our seizure of Lithuania proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN66.A;Wilna will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN67.T;The Vilnius War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN67.D;Our forces managed to make contact with the White Ruthenian Army in Vilnius. There we attempted to persuade them to surrender the city without bloodshed, given the chaotic state of Lithuania and the presence of many refugees from the anti-Commonwealth war. The defenders refused, declaring that neither Scandinavia nor Ruthenia would gain their submission! We must make them see the error of their ways by force, and quickly, or else our rival will secure the crown jewel of Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN67.A;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN68.T;Reply of the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN68.D;”Stanislaw, despised by God and the people, King of Poland, footstool of the Lithuanians and Ruthenians, locksmith of Prussia, cook of Masovia, wheelwright of Samogitia, drunkard of Kiev, swineherd of Volhynia, sausage of Podolia, pederast of Podlasie, beggar of Livonia, prostitute of Smolensk, knave of Severia, and great fool of Chernihiv : We report to you that we have no thoughts of surrendering to you, but are bravely, manfully, and eternally resolved to fight you, your sycophants, and all your followers, and especially you, who can be compared not to a fellow, but rather to a cursed old woman, if one may even call you so.”\n\nThe Cossacks refused our request for them to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN68.A;We need a new plan…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN69.T;The Cossack and Tatar Problems;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN69.D;It has become apparent that indirect control of the Cossack and the Tatar lands is not only infeasible, but impossible. So long as they are not monitored by a constant security presence, they will lapse back into nomadism and brigandry, pestering our settled communities with raids and other such menaces. We can only take permanent control of these lands through an extensive colonization program, one which shall require military protection in order to be completed. Thus we have devised a plan to establish a series of militarized voivodeships along the frontier, where the native populations will be forced to sedentarize and will be joined by communities of armed Polish settlers. If we wish to tame the Pontic Steppe, then it can only be through the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN69.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN70.T;Our Voivodeship Status;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN70.D;We are a Polish voivodeship and bound by the resulting laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN70.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN71.T;Voivodeship Status Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN71.D;The Polish have decided to end our voivodeship status and annex us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN71.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN72.T;The integration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN72.D;Exciting news from $FROMCOUNTRY$, as the voivodeship reports its confidence in its integration into $COUNTRY$ proper! For a long time, the voivodeship worked to bring its territories ever so close to our country, and now that hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN72.A;$COUNTRY$ grows ever larger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN73.T;The Voivodeship Falls!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN73.D;We have vanquished the Poles’ precious voivodeship in our homeland! Now is the time to once again decide our own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN73.A;May they never return!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLCN74.T;Formation of the Akhtuba Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN74.D;Polish imperialism has come to our lands, as Warsaw has installed a puppet government to control us. This can only be a pretext to prepare us for eventual annexation, as befell the other Cossack hosts in the west. Hopefully we shall find some means of escaping their noose before it can draw around our necks…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN74.A;For now, we bide our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN75.T;Formation of the Achtuba Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN75.D;The last of the Cossacks have been brought to heel! With the submission of the Akhtuba Host, the western Pontic Steppe has been tamed. It is true that the remote location of the Achtuba-Astrachan frontier makes it difficult to establish a normal voivodeship, and thus we will need a different approach. We have instead created a colonial government which will compel the Cossacks to sedentarize without such an aggressive settlement program as was conducted in the west. This will ensure the smooth assimilation of the Akhtuba cossacks into $COUNTRY$. For now let us celebrate, as the wars of the steppe to put down the Cossack threat are at last over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN75.A;Victory at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN76.T;Rise of Nikita Semenko and the Revolutionary Insurgent Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN76.D;Born near Kyiv to a poor Cossack family, Nikita Semenko’s family soon fled eastwards due to his father’s support for the haydamaks’ insurrections. After his father died of an infected wound, Nikita was sent to live with his relatives in Lviv. There he witnessed the cruelty of the szlachta and the emerging industrialist class. He became involved in leftist circles while periodically returning home. Semenko was fired from his factory job for defending a female worker from being assaulted by the factory owner’s son. He returned home, refining his libertarian communist views and organizing among the Cossacks embittered by the loss of their old lands and ways. Now, after years in prison for his actions, Semenko has once again returned, and has organized the oppressed Cossacks of the Achtuba Protectorate into the Revolutionary Insurgency Army! His anarcho-communist peasants became the bane of the countryside, before Semenko’s men converged on the capital. The colonial government has fled in terror, but the Poles will return…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN76.A;Our chains lie broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN760.T;The Regional Congress of Peasants, Workers, and Insurgents;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN760.D;”Anarchism is as revolutionary, as diverse, and as sublime in every facet as is human life itself.” - Nikita Semenko\n\nThe Revolutionary Insurgent Army’s first order of business after seizing Akhtuba was to establish a foundation for their new and radical vision of government. Delegates from both urban and rural communities have been invited to the Regional Congress of Peasants, Workers, and Insurgents, a democratic assembly to represent the network of councils springing up across the land. The Congress seeks  "a society without ruling landowners, without subordinate slaves, without rich or poor", and called upon Cossacks to begin building this society by themselves, "without tyrannical decrees and orders, and in defiance of tyrants and oppressors throughout the world." All private lands are being seized and made public. The Congress finished by agreeing to hold a second meeting once the west is liberated…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN760.A;No gods, no masters, only the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN77.T;Black Flags in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN77.D;When we heard of anarchist militias organizing in our Achtuba Protectorate, we first thought that it was no more than alarmism - after all, had the Cossacks not been completely subjugated? The arrival of the tattered survivors of the colonial government, however, have impressed upon us the magnitude of this threat. They speak of the whole Protectorate in chaos, overrun by terrorist Nikita Semenko and his Revolutionary Insurgency Army. It seems that our efforts to sedentarize the Cossacks has driven many of them to turn to Blanquism to address their newfound status as peasants or urban workers. Rumors abound that the RIA has already penetrated the eastern voivodeships…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN77.A;Crush these criminals AT ONCE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN77.B;Take a bow from the red Cossack! §R(JOIN THE REVOLUTION)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN78.T;The Steppe is in Chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN78.D;The Cossack rebellion is worse than we had imagined. The voivodeships have plunged into anarchy - the anarchy of Nikita Semenko and his RIA. Polish settlers have been attacked by mobs of peasants, while Polish industrialists have been hounded through city streets by irate workers. There is seemingly no place east of Kijów safe from Semenko’s thugs, as the siren call of Blanquism has proven too powerful for the Cossacks to resist. Some speak of this rebellion as a manifestation of nationalism, but what it is matters little at the moment. The important thing is that these insurgents have been largely welcomed by the rest of the Slavic populace, and foreign Blanquist groups have already declared their support for Semenko’s uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN78.A;These damned Cossacks, unruly to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN79.T;Birth of the Free Territory of Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN79.D;Commander Semenko and the rest of the RIA’s Military Executive Council knew that creating the Zavolzhye Republic was only the beginning of their mission. It was a good foundation, but now, they and the Ukrainian people have forged something even greater. With most of the Wild Fields now under the control of worker and peasant soviets (councils), an All-Ukrainian Congress of Peasants, Workers, and Insurgents has been convened. At this Congress, it has been decided that the Zavolzhye Republic shall be superseded by a new, decentralized confederation of anarchist soviets under the leadership of the Congress and the Council - the Free Territory of Ukraine! Never in human history has such a wild experiment of anarcho-communism been attempted. The Poles thought that they would destroy the Cossacks, but they merely finalized their proletarianization, and now the Cossacks ride forth against Warsaw under the black flag of anarchism. May Commander Semenko lead us to the liberation of all those beneath the Polish yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN79.A;A thousand years of anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN80.T;The Semenkovshchina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN80.D;”Anarkhiya-mama syniv svoyikh lyubyt', Anarkhiya-mama ne prodast', Svyntsevym doshchem voroha pryholubyt', Anarkhiya-mama za nas!” - “Mother Anarchy Loves Her Sons,” Revolutionary Insurgency Army song and unofficial anthem of the Free Territory of Ukraine\n\nWarsaw’s unrelenting war against Cossack and Tatar nomadism has led to unforeseen consequences. By forcing the peoples of the steppe into lives of sedentary labor, the Poles have awakened their class consciousness. The endless march of capital into the Wild Fields has at last met its match in Commander Nikita Semenko. His anarcho-communist Revolutionary Insurgency Army has rallied the Cossacks to the banner of a rebellion in the name of Mother Anarchy. It may well be the last Cossack rebellion, but if this is their fate, they shall ride forth and meet it smiling - and, if foreign socialist powers intervene, they might even win…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN80.A;Anarchy is nothing but chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN81.T;The Revolution Comes to Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN81.D;Nikita Semenko has not acted alone. Knowing that the Russian people have also fallen under the Polish yoke, he helped Russian anarchist Andrei Dutov infiltrate the Polish puppet state. Now Dutov’s Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party has built sufficient support amongst the workers and peasants of central Russia to seize power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN81.D;Onwards against capital!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN82.T;The Russian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN82.D;Nikita Semenko has not acted alone. In preparation for his uprising, he helped Russian anarchist Andrei Dutov infiltrate our northern protectorate. Now Dutov’s Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party has built sufficient support amongst the workers and peasants of central Russia to seize power, and join forces with Semenko against us! A general strike brought their economy to a standstill, and Russian laborers and soldiers have formed soviets (councils) under the leadership of “Chairman” Dutov, repudiating all allegiance to us. However, we know from sources within both movements that Dutov and Semenko, and their movements in turn, are not nearly as friendly as it would appear from the outside. We may be able to sign a separate treaty with Dutov to allow our forces to focus on the Ukrainians, but doing so would leave Central Russia beyond our control, and may even allow Dutov to seek Russian unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN82.A;They will find no safety in numbers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN82.B;Perhaps we should accept the loss of Russia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN83.T;The End of the Semenkovshchina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN83.D;The final rebellion of the Cossacks has come to an end, with Polish and Lithuanian forces once again in control of the steppe. The soviets have been dismantled, and all those who fought beneath the black flag of anarchism will be punished, with or without the instruments of the law. Ominously, Nikita Semenko’s body has not been located. It is believed that he perished in the siege of Akhtuba, but no physical evidence of his death has been found. Wild stories are already being thrown about of his miraculous escape. In all probability his bones are waiting to be discovered in a ditch somewhere. At any rate, the power of the Cossacks has for the last time been broken. The entrenchment of the colonial structure in the east will prevent any repeats of this insurrection. The Wild Fields are wild no longer, and from Astrachan to Kijów, none dare to challenge our authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN83.A;The raiders shall ride no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN84.T;The Semenkovshchina Endures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN84.D;How!? How can this be possible!? The greatest soldiers of the Commonwealth have gone against the bandits of the east - and lost! The military high command is at a loss to explain this outrageous failure. They ascribe it to everything from massive partisan opposition by Ruthenian sympathizers, to lack of familiarity with the landscape, to the wrath of God. In truth it does not matter why the war was lost. What matters is that the Free Territory of Ukraine, God help us, is unbowed. A peace treaty has been signed in Kyiv, revising our borders to recognize the loss of the Cossack lands. The world watches in horror as the black flag of anarchy flies high above Europe, and the Ukrainians are now free to carry out their mad experiment in governance, or lack thereof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN84.A;Madness, sheer madness…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN85.T;The Tatars Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN85.D;It is a dark day for the peoples of eastern Europe. The Tatar menace has not only survived our assault, but they are stronger than ever. Facing the invasion of the Polish and Lithuanian heartlands, we were left with no choice but to sign a peace treaty allocating all of the Wild Fields to the Tatars. This is the catastrophic conclusion to our eastern policy - a defeat this monumental has sowed eternal doubt within the hearts of our people as to the ability of our nation to tame the eastern frontier. Perhaps it was not meant to be tamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN85.A;And the Tatars ride on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN86.T;The End of Tatarstan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN86.D;Centuries of struggle against the Tatars of the steppe have finally come to an end. With their great confederation laid low, we have taken the opportunity to dissolve it. The Tatar lands far to the east have been left in the hands of obedient local lords who are more interested in ruling their own people than striking against us to take vengeance. All lands which we have not generously reserved for the remaining Tatars will be properly settled to prevent any future rebellions. May the spirits of past generations slain or stolen into slavery by the Tatar menace rest easily, now that they have been avenged, and the steppes tamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN86.A;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN87.T;The Cossacks Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN87.D;It is a shameful day for the peoples of our Commonwealth. The Cossack menace has not only survived our assault, but they are stronger than ever. Facing the invasion of the Polish and Lithuanian heartlands, we were left with no choice but to sign a peace treaty allocating all of the Wild Fields to the Cossacks. This is the catastrophic conclusion to our eastern policy - a defeat this monumental has sowed eternal doubt within the hearts of our people as to the ability of our nation to tame the eastern frontier. Perhaps it was not meant to be tamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLCN88.T;The Cossacks Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN88.D;Centuries of struggle against the Cossacks of the steppe have finally come to an end. With their great confederation laid low, we have taken the opportunity to dissolve it. Already our ministers are planning out networks of settlements by which we will colonize the Wild Fields, now that their restive populace has been brought to heel. In time even the peoples of the Ukraine will be forced to realize that the Cossack way of life is at an end. In time, a new and civilized order shall arise in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN88.A;A welcome conclusion to the drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN89.T;Assuming Control of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLCN89.D;As promised, we have guided the rulers of Moscow into control over all of central Russia. Now comes the time for them to fulfill their obligations to us. In a grand ceremony, the “Tsar” of Muscovy has confirmed the status of the Commonwealth as Muscovy’s protector. While the festivities were carefully structured to avoid any direct scenes of submission on the part of the new Muscovite ruler to avoid poisoning his reputation among his new subjects, there is no doubt that Muscovy lies within our grasp. It is possible that the Muscovite regime will eventually falter in the face of renewed Russian nationalism, but for the time being our influence in Muscovy appears stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

RUT2.T;The Establishment of the Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT2.D;Volodymyr Doroshenko, Hetman of the Ruthenian Army, opened the General Rada by officially resigning his position, henceforth participating as an ordinary delegate. He explained that he did not want to unduly influence the assembly through his rank. That being said, he still commands tremendous respect, and may end up in power anyway. Regardless, the first order of business was the creation of a provisional government, constituted out of the All-Ruthenian National Congress which led us to freedom from the Polish-Lithuanian yoke. This government shall conduct the basic functions of governance until the Rada is concluded and a constitution adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT2.A;Our nation continues to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT3.T;Peasants March in Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT3.D;The General Rada has been interrupted by squads of peasant volunteers from the Ruthenian Army, who have converged upon Kyiv. So far as we can tell, they lack a clear leader, but their demands could not be clearer. The self-proclaimed “peasant delegates” seek the immediate abolition of all forms of serfdom or peonage, and the transfer of all noble-held lands to their peasant residents without any compensation to the landowners - including the magnates’ manors! We believe that these protests will eventually burn themselves out, but some of the more anxious delegates believe that we need to crack down on the demonstrators to prevent them from throwing the city into chaos and overrunning the assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT3.A;Let them protest, they helped win the war after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT3.B;Drive out these mobs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT4.T;A Liberal Coup D’Etat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT4.D;Our violent crackdown on the “peasant delegates” outraged the liberal deputies, who wasted no time in abandoning the General Rada and meeting with influential peasant soldiers who survived the “Kyiv Massacre.” The two factions agreed that the attack was clear evidence that the nobility was out of control, and needed to be purged from power for the sake of the people. Soon afterward, liberal forces and rearmed haydamakas descended upon the Kyiv Gymnasium! The nobles were forced out of the assembly, and the liberals, led by prominent lawyer Valerian Khyvlovy, seized control of the General Rada. Soon they will finish the new Ruthenian constitution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT4.A;Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT5.T;The General Rada Continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT5.D;To avert disaster, a few popular liberal deputies went out and met with the most influential members of the “peasant delegates”. These high-profile negotiations assured the peasants that land reform would be forthcoming, allowing the assembly to move forward. So far they have agreed that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly will be constitutional rights, and that any political party which registers with the government shall be allowed to freely contest any election. The topic which looms in the distance, hurtling towards us all, is the nature of the Head of State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT5.A;The eyes of Ruthenia are upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT6.T;The Head of State Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT6.D;The Second General Rada of the Rus’ has been quite civil - until now. The monarchists and the republicans have descended into furious arguments about the fundamental nature of our future government. The monarchists argue that only a king can provide stability, and win us respect in the eyes of the other nations of Europe. The republicans counter that one need look no further to see the weaknesses of monarchism than Poland, and that the Ruthenian people deserve a truly free nation, without the shackles of aristocracy. Whichever side falters first will undoubtedly seek retaliation. In the end, the General Rada decided that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT6.A;Ruthenia needs a king for the sake of her honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT6.B;Ruthenia needs a republic for the sake of her liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT7.T;The Khvylovy Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT7.D;The republicans have refused to accept the idea of a Ruthenian monarchy. A hardcore group of agitators quickly assembled around radical liberal lawyer Valerian Khvylovy, who sought to seize control of the General Rada and purge the monarchists! The next few days after the monarchists’ political victory at the assembly were tense, as all of Kyiv hummed with rumor. It seemed that nobody could predict the strength of the republicans, or whether Khvylovy’s conspiracy even existed outside of his personal clique. Eventually, however, matters came to a head. This morning, Khvylovy’s supporters assembled at the Kyiv Gymnasium to storm the assembly and remove the monarchists by force. Soon enough…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT7.A;Khvylovy and a few other liberal extremists were swiftly arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT7.B;Hundreds of radicals surged inside and ousted the reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT8.T;The Hetman of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT8.D;A strange faction has emerged amongst the delegates. They champion the Hetman of the Cossacks for leadership of our prospective republic! As they argue, while he might be a coarse man, his charisma and fame amongst the lower class would cement our government’s popularity with the common people, especially the peasantry. Furthermore, the Cossacks’ military power, if combined with our own strength and political zeal, could lay the foundation of an even greater state - a unified Russia, a union of all the Eastern Slavs, beneath our banner. And by being the ones to make the offer, we could decide upon the terms by which he would be given power. It is true that many radicalists, particularly Valerian Khyvlovy, have denounced the pro-Cossack faction for “searching out a Caesar,” but it is a tempting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT8.A;We will never betray our loyalty to the spirit of human freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT8.B;ALL the Eastern Slavs, beneath our banner? Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT9.T;A Hetman of All the Rus’!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT9.D;In a grand ceremony at St. Volodymyr’s Cathedral in Kyiv, Cossack Hetman Stepan Sternenko was coronated as “Hetman of Ukraine and all the Rus’!” Shortly after leaving the church where he was crowned, he gave a brief but colorful speech in which he declared that Kyiv will be the birthplace of a new Russia, a Russia forged in the Wild Fields and the struggles of the haydamakas. While many liberal intellectuals are aghast at this betrayal of the Radicalist ethos, the common people seem awed by Sternenko’s promises of future glory. The one potential wrinkle in this grand design is Scandinavia. They have been keeping a close eye on us since our independence from the Commonwealth, and their opposition to pan-Russian nationalism is no secret. They will not take kindly to our new ambitions…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT9.A;One Rus’, beneath one Hetman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT10.T;The Final Session of the Second General Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT10.D;In spite of all obstacles, the monarchists have garnered enough support to push forward their goals. But who shall wear the crown? The leading candidate is, predictably, Doroshenko. From the moment he resigned as Hetman, there were whispers that his highly public resignation was a calculated stunt to enhance his reputation. Doroshenko would likely make a fine king - he is shrewd, confident, and pragmatic. Yet he is not the only candidate. The young Prince Mykolay Chetvertynsky comes from a family with Rurikid roots that has produced multiple Orthodox metropolitans. Mykolay won fame during the independence war as the youngest haydamak commander, renowned for his ferocity. The prince has turned heads with his bellicose rhetoric, proclaiming his desire to unite all of the Eastern Slavs beneath our banner. Even Doroshenko has not gone so far as to make such lofty proposals, and Mykolay, despite his mercurial reputation, may be our best chance at a greater destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT10.A;Long live King Volodymyr!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT10.B;Long live King Mykolay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT100.T;Coronation of the King of Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT100.D;In a grand ceremony at St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, former Hetman of the Ruthenian Army Volodymyr Doroshenko was crowned King Volodymyr I! Doroshenko has promised to respect the will of the people, though he shows no desire to reduce the power of the monarchy. Volodymyr’s ascent has marked the withering of pan-Russian nationalism within Ruthenia, and the pursuit of a separate, Uniate national identity. This has met with approval from the great powers, especially Scandinavia, who have long feared the rise of an aggressive East Slavic realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT100.A;Slava Rusi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT11.T;Formation of the Ruthenian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT11.D;The new Ruthenian constitution has been ratified and signed! The liberal document establishes Ruthenia as a democratic federation, with significant autonomy reserved to the provinces and their legislatures. The constitution guarantees universal male suffrage but also requires all men to serve in the military when required. With the government’s foundation established, many have proposed that the federation may be destined for greater matters than a mere regional power within eastern Europe. Perhaps we shall take leadership of all eastern Slavs…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT11.A;Long live the free Ruthenian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT12.T;The Organization of True Ruthenians Strikes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT12.D;Not everyone was eager to support pan-Russian ambitions in Ruthenia. The Organization of True Ruthenians (OTR), led by notorious haydamak leader Symon Mazepa, have for years supported the complete supremacy of the Ruthenian Uniate Church and the defense of the aristocratic order. Now, with the Ruthenian government openly espousing reformism, the OTR has made their move. This morning Mazepa led the OTR and sympathetic Halychian and szlachta army officers in an attack on Kyiv! They have circulated a manifesto explaining their actions as being “in defense of a free Ruthenia, of her ancient nobility, and of God’s Holy Ruthenian Uniate Church.” The Uniate zealots have encountered stiff opposition from a broad section of Kyiv’s citizenry, from Orthodox Christians to Jews to pan-Russian nationalists and even Blanquists! Yet they command strong support from the nobility and the Uniate clergy. An OTR defeat here could have cataclysmic effects on the Uniate faith…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT12.A;The OTR sweeps into power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT12.B;The anti-OTR coalition thwarts the coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT120.T;The Government of National Defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT120.D;The OTR acted quickly upon seizing control of the government. An emergency session of the national assembly was convened to officially recognize Symon Mazepa as President - given that the building was surrounded by armed Uniates, they had little choice in the matter. The OTR has also forced through a new constitution, reorganizing the nation into a unitary state ruled directly from Kyiv with the Ruthenian Uniate Church as its official state religion. President Mazepa has pledged to defend the nation from “Poles, Lithuanians, Jews, Turks, Russians, socialists, and all others who would threaten our beautiful Ruthenia.” The one foreign power who seems excited by this development is Scandinavia, who has been quick to form a military alliance with us in the name of safeguarding the stability of eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT120.A;We were born at a great hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT13.T;Coronation of the King of Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT13.D;In a grand ceremony at St. Volodymyr’s Cathedral in Kyiv, Prince Mykolay Chetvertynsky has been crowned King Mykolay I of Ruthenia! In his coronation address, the new King welcomed the adoption of a constitution and announced his commitment to religious toleration, though he made it clear that the Eastern Orthodox Church would henceforth receive preferential treatment. The constitution, drafted chiefly by the conservatives, has nonetheless upheld and expanded civil liberties, organizing Ruthenia as a federal monarchy with certain autonomies for the provinces and their legislatures. The one area where the king has not moderated his tone whatsoever is pan-Russian nationalism : King Mykolay I closed his address with, “I swear before God as my witness that when I next address you, I shall do so as Emperor of all the Russians!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT13.A;Slava Rusi! Slava Korol’ Mykolay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT14.T;The Ruthenian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT14.D;We had hoped that an independent Ruthenia would stabilize eastern Europe and prevent either the Poles or the Russians from growing too powerful. It is now clear that this plan had a fatal flaw : it did not account for Ruthenia embracing pan-Russian nationalism. The Ruthenians have, in a fit of madness, elected Cossack Hetman Stepan Sternenko as “Hetman of all Ukraine and the Rus’!” Sternenko and his Cossacks have made clear their intent to unite all the Russians beneath their rule. We cannot allow that mob of unwashed barbarians to become a threat! A unified, Ruthenian-led Russia must not come to pass, or else all of our lands east of the Gulf of Bothnia will be forfeit. Our generals are urging our Head of State to issue an ultimatum to the Ruthenians, demanding that they publicly disavow pan-Russian projects or face war. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT14.A;We must prevent a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT14.B;We are occupied at the moment, but we will withdraw our diplomats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

RUT15.D;We had hoped that an independent Ruthenia would stabilize eastern Europe and prevent either the Poles or the Russians from growing too powerful. It is now clear that this plan had a fatal flaw : it did not account for Ruthenia embracing pan-Russian nationalism. The Ruthenians have elected a liberal coalition which seeks to expand their federation across all of Russia! The reported pacifism of their ruling party has failed to materialize. We cannot allow this unruly band of peasants to become a threat! A unified, Ruthenian-led Russia must not come to pass, or else all of our lands east of the Gulf of Bothnia will be forfeit. Our generals are urging our Head of State to issue an ultimatum to the Ruthenians, demanding that they publicly disavow pan-Russian projects or face war. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

RUT16.D;We had hoped that an independent Ruthenia would stabilize eastern Europe and prevent either the Poles or the Russians from growing too powerful. It is now clear that this plan had a fatal flaw : it did not account for Ruthenia embracing pan-Russian nationalism. The Ruthenians have crowned Prince Nicholas Chetvertynsky, descended from the old Rurikid dynasty, as King Nicholas I, who has declared his intent to claim the title of “Emperor of all the Russians!” We cannot allow that mob of unwashed barbarians to become a threat to our control of the Baltic! A unified, Ruthenian-led Russia must not come to pass, or else all of our lands east of the Gulf of Bothnia will be forfeit.

RUT17.T;Scandinavia Terminates Diplomatic Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT17.D;Our announcement of pan-Russian ambitions have gone down poorly amongst the Scandinavians. As soon as we made our intentions known, Scandinavia withdrew all diplomatic personnel from Ruthenia. Their ambassador, in his final message to our government, curtly informed us that Scandinavia “cannot endorse any program which may jeopardize the security of eastern Europe.” It is fortunate that this seems to be the extent of their protests. Now, the road to the unification of Russia is open - despite Scandinavia’s objections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT17.A;How rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT18.T;The Ultimatum from Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT18.D;Scandinavia has refused to accept our pan-Russian ambitions. At first we thought they might withdraw their entire diplomatic staff from Ruthenia in protest, but to our shock they have gone even further. Shortly after the last member of the Scandinavian embassy was withdrawn, we received a message from the Nordics by way of the Venetian ambassador. It stated that the current Ruthenian government was “in complete opposition” to peace and stability in eastern Europe, and demanded that we not only renounce all pan-Russian ambitions but immediately remove our current Head of State from power and crown Prince Hans af Stewart of Scandinavia as our king! This is an outrageous demand, and many in our government at first thought it a hoax. But it is legitimate, and we have every reason to believe that if we defy Scandinavia, then they shall declare war. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT18.A;It seems that we have no choice in the matter but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT18.B;The Scandinavians can go to Hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT19.T;The Scandinavian-Ruthenian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT19.D;”Ruthenia has always aspired to be free, but being surrounded by enemies, she has been forced to seek a protector, and in turn a master. At all points when she has looked for an alliance, she has been made first a subject and then a slave.” - Jean-Jacques Arouet, 1731\n\nRuthenia’s troubles did not end when she liberated herself from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Scandinavia, long the greatest foe of pan-Russian nationalism, supported the Ruthenians prior to their victory in the war for independence, but has now turned against them. In theory this conflict stems from the Ruthenians’ refusal to crown a member of the House of Stuart, Scandinavia’s dynasty, as their king. But far more objectionable to Scandinavia is Ruthenia’s new espousal of pan-Russian rhetoric. If Ruthenia falters here then she will remain what she has been since the coming of the Mongols : a pawn for greater powers. If she prevails, then Europe shall tremble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT19.A;Slava Rus’!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT20.T;Rik Prynyzhennya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT20.D;The concept of a resurgent Ruthenia with its “lofty ambitions” did not bode well for the Nordics. Despite our efforts in preserving our sovereignty and to uphold our free, God-given right to exist as a family of fraternal nations, all of it was for naught despite our cries to the international community. The once noble East Slavic peoples are once again forced to submit in this new reality where they will once be another pawn to European ambitions.\n\nThe Ruthenian government at Vilnius has been forced to submit to the demands given out by the Scandinavian government effective now, stipulating that the lands of the former Principality of Belarus and the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia be restored to their natural borders under Scandinavian influence reducing Ruthenia to its former Ukrainian lands around the Principality of Kyiv, nothing less than a mere shell of its former itself. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT20.A;How will the Varangians of old react to such treachery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT21.T;The Treaty of Vilnius;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT21.D;Our incursion into Ruthenia was a resounding success! The ragtag Ruthenian upstarts were quickly beaten back due to their irreplaceable losses on the battlefield and their inability to contend with Scandinavian mettle and were forced to sue for peace. With it we can be relieved that the dream of a resurgent Ruthenia is dead. Furthermore, the Ruthenian government has warmly received our terms to instill again the needed stability in the region, firmly bringing it under our “protective influence” as a much needed bulwark against Russian expansion, much to the rejoice of Unionist and pro-Scandinavian elements in the Riksdag. Peace has been restored to the Slavic lands once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

RUT23.D;Our incursion into Ruthenia was a spectacular mess. Despite many officers in the Hæren insisting that the incursion will be a cakewalk, some even boasting that the “charade can be settled in two weeks'', we have been begrudgingly mistaken.The steppes of Ukraine and the mountains of the Carpathians are awash of fallen Scandinavian sons who have trekked into this foreign land thousands of miles away from home. Our government, quick to avoid public opinion turning against us in the midst of unfavorable coverage of the war by the press (at times even making past censors) has been forced to sign an honorable peace with the puny Ruthenians. We might have failed in subjugating the East Slavs and putting some sense into their whims, but at least Scandinavian honor and resolve still remains intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT23.A;We must be ever vigilant in the times to come;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT24.T;The “Russian” Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT24.D;As soon as the Second General Rada of the Rus’ was opened, debate centered around the so-called “Russian Question.” The presence of such a powerful neighbor on our border has led many delegates to argue for our unification with Russia. They claim that as the Ruthenian peoples are fellow eastern Slavs, we should join hands with our kin to the east. This line of thinking has been denounced by the Ruthenian Uniates, who have decried the Russophiles for throwing away our hard-won sovereignty. They see unification with the Orthodox Christian Russia as the kiss of death for Uniate Christianity. All told, the “Russian Question” has provoked such ferocious arguments within the Rada that no other business can be accomplished until it is settled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT24.A;What a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT25.T;The Battle of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT25.D;The confrontation over the “Russian Question” has spilled out into the streets! This morning, Orthodox and Ruthenian Uniate militias clashed throughout the city of Kyiv, sparked by rumors that each faction was planning to purge the other. The haydamakas have divided along religious lines, and both sides seem equally matched. This is the climatic moment which shall decide the future of Ruthenia and her people. Whichever side prevails will doubtlessly conduct a campaign of cultural suppression against the vanquished. Will Ruthenia retain her independence, or become another player in the great Russian orchestra?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT25.A;The Orthodox Christians are victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT25.B;The Ruthenian Uniates are victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT240.T;Ruthenia Petitions for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT240.D;Following a skirmish amongst the delegates of the Second General Rada of the Rus’ in Kiev, the Orthodox Christian (or Russophile) faction has prevailed over its Uniate opponents. They have wasted no time in drafting and submitting a formal request for the unification of our nations, citing our long historical and cultural ties. The measure commands broad popularity across the Russian and Eastern Orthodox Christian worlds, so there seems to be no reason to deny them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT240.A;We welcome the return of White Russia to her motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT250.T;Birth of the Ruthenian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT250.D;The Ruthenian Uniates have crushed the Russophile traitors! With their defeat and subsequent purging from the General Rada, the Uniate-liberal coalition was swift to draft a new Ruthenian constitution. This document establishes Ruthenia as a democratic federation, with significant autonomy reserved to the provinces and their legislatures. The constitution guarantees universal male suffrage on the condition of military service. The only remaining question is how this proclamation of an independent Ruthenian republic will be taken by the Russians…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT250.A;Long live the free Ruthenian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT26.T;The Ruthenian Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT26.D;A calamity has befallen Ruthenia! The Second General Rada of the Rus’, a body convened to establish the new Ruthenian constitution, has been seized by Ruthenian Uniate zealots. Survivors of the so-called “Battle of Kiev” have relayed tales of militias hounding Orthodox Christian delegates through the streets. Worse, the Rada has proclaimed Ruthenia to be an independent state with no connections to Russia! This is of course absurd. As we all know, the Ruthenians are merely the White Russians, long estranged from us due to Polish and Lithuanian imperialism. We cannot allow a gang of crypto-Catholic criminals to oppress the Russian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT26.A;We must liberate White Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT27.T;The Anger of the Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT27.D;Russia has refused to accept our declaration of independence, nor our constitution’s assertion of a separate national identity from their own. They have declared Ruthenia to be “the occupied territory of White Russia” and have denounced our “persecutions of the Orthodox Christian community”. We have every reason to believe that these accusations herald a Russian invasion! It seems that the first war of Ruthenian independence was not to be the last. We must make another stand for our freedom, this time against our fellow eastern Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT27.A;Let them come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT28.T;The Russo-Ruthenian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT28.D;”If Ruthenia did not collapse in the first weeks of the revolution - when she had no organs of government other than a legislature in recess and a hetman often unable to communicate with his army - then she will not collapse now.” - Ruthenian Foreign Minister Mykhailo Khrushchev\n\nRuthenia’s declaration of independence and assertion of a separate national identity has been rejected by Russia in the most vivid way imaginable. The Russian government insists that “Ruthenia” is nothing but a vestige of Polish imperialism created to cleave the eastern Slavs apart, and given Ruthenia’s failure to acknowledge this “truth,” have resorted to military force to assert their claim. Ruthenia, so newly free, is now thrown into a fight for her life against the Russian bear. Many doubt her chances, but the Ruthenians have already proven to have a talent for upset victories - a talent she will need to exercise if she has any hope of survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT28.A;This is only a special military operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT29.T;The Treaty of Kiev;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT29.D;In the end there was little doubt who would prevail in Russia’s quest to liberate its western lands. The bandits of the west proved incapable of fending off a coordinated invasion from a more numerous and battle-tested enemy. Once Russia’s opponents had been swept from the field, they assembled in Kiev to conclude hostilities. This treaty dissolved the unlawful bandit regime and transferred White Russia to the rightful control of her motherland. Russian forces have already begun a campaign to remove any symbols or iconography which could be used by future criminals to resurrect the illegitimate, Polish-spawned entity which has now been erased from the face of Europe. The Uniate Church has not escaped this fate, with many metropolitans pressured or even forced to break ties with the Holy See. Even the very name of Russia’s defeated enemy has been suppressed by her officials. The final consolidation of the eastern Slavs will surely open the way for more conflicts to come amidst the ruins of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT29.A;The possibilities are limitless for a united Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT30.T;The Treaty of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT30.D;David has beaten Goliath! Ruthenia has forced back the Russian invasion and asserted her independence for all the world to see. Her newly minted army, with its officers drawn in part from the haydamaka captains, proved a match for those who so haughtily denied Ruthenia’s existence as a separate state. With Ruthenia prevailing across its entire eastern frontier, Russia was forced to seek peace terms, and thus their representatives gathered in the Ruthenia capital of Kyiv. The resulting treaty affirmed Ruthenian sovereignty, with Russia forced to explicitly recognize the Ruthenian nation and people as different from their own. This victory has quashed pan-Russian nationalism across eastern Europe, potentially for a whole generation. Russia may revive its dreams of hegemony over the eastern Slavs in the future, but for today, Ruthenia is Ruthenia, and she is free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT30.A;§bSlava Rusi! Slava Rusi!§ §YSlava Rusi! Slava Rusi!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT31.T;An Inconvenient Truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT31.D;Our pan-Russian aspirations have hit a slight snag : the realization of east Slavic unity has already been accomplished by a nation other than our own. This has thrown pan-Russian nationalism into question, with many Ruthenian Uniates claiming that to sign our nation away into Russian hands would be to surrender our cultural identity. What was once a dominant ideology within Ruthenian society is now coming under increasing scrutiny, as Ruthenian nationalism ascends to take its place. We must come to terms with the fact that the first page in the history of a unified Russia has already been authored by foreign hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT31.A;There will always be a Ruthenia…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT32.T;Ruthenia Marches East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT32.D;When Ruthenia freed itself from Polish oppression, we had expected the White Russians to join forces with us in the unification of Russia. It is thus with great shock that we have received news that Ruthenia is mustering their armies for war against us! Ruthenia has declared themselves to be the sole protector of the eastern Slavs, and will not relent until all of Russia is consolidated beneath their rule. We cannot allow the Uniate papists to destroy the one true Orthodox Church! If these spawns of the Poles seize control of all of Russia then our faith will surely perish. Even the Cossacks may strike against us in our embattled state. For our sake, for the sake of Russia, and for the sake of all the righteous followers of our Lord Jesus Christ and His Patriarchs, we must put down the Ruthenian menace, here and now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT32.A;Urah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT33.T;The War of the Three Sisters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT33.D;Ruthenia, Ukraine, and Muscovy have all declared themselves to be the protectors of all eastern Slavs. These nations have in turn rejected demands from their rivals to submit to their authority. Eastern Europe thus finds itself awash in turmoil, with a three-sided civil war breaking out amongst the children of the Rus’ for hegemony over their cultural kin. Whoever prevails shall surely become the beacon of Slavic culture throughout the world when they establish a modern pan-Russian state. It is difficult for outsiders to comprehend how Great Russia, Little Russia, and White Russia - three lands which speak almost identical languages, and with so many similarities between their peoples - could find themselves locked in such a bitter conflict. But it is from this similarity that a desire to find difference has been born, a desire which has driven the three sisters of the Rus’ to sororicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT33.A;There can be only one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT34.T;The War of the Three Sisters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
RUT34.D;The Ruthenians have declared their intent to unify Russia, and are locked in conflict with their counterparts to the northeast, who share the same ambition. We, too, seek to bring unity to the eastern Slavs, and therefore we must act! Now is the time to lay both powers low while they are distracted.

RUT340.T;The Fate of Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUT340.D;We have recently taken control of the lands of the Duchy of Nitra, or "Slovakia" as its nationalists call it. However, only a small amount of Nitran territory is officially claimed by our nation. Our foreign minister has advised that we recruit sympathetic Slovakian politicians to create a protectorate that will rule their territory in our name, while we keep control of the Ruthenian lands in the east. A few ministers have argued in favor of continuing the occupation, but the Slovak lands are well-suited to guerilla warfare, which could threaten our control of the region if we make an enemy of its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUT340.A;Organize a loyal Slovakia under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUT340.B;Military occupation is the only answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_central_lithuania_desc;Russia's Baltic Focus had claimed both Finland and the northern Baltic States but had completely ignored the territory of Lithuania due to the continued existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

MUS09.T;The End of the Golden Age;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS09.D;It is clear by now that Liberal, Socialist and Nationalist agitation throughout the Russian Empire has effectively ended the Russian Golden Age. Reform, is not something that the backwater Russian states have ever been well known for and while liberals ravaged Central Europe in the late 18th century and early 19th century : Russia might as well have been on another plane of existence. However with the formation of a unified Russian state a great deal of western liberals and socialists had made their way over to the rising great power and started agitation throughout the lower classes and military. The Tsar must act now or risk a potentially disastrous rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS10.T;The Tsar has been Assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
MUS10.D;During one of the Tsars many national tours, a man with a improvised explosive rushed his coach and blew it up. Since the suspect had been killed along with the Tsar, there is little or no way to tell whom the individual that assassinated the Tsar was. It is also likely that he was from one of the many groups in Russia seeking to increase their influence by destabilizing the Empire but there is absolutely is no way to be sure. The new tsar, a young man with a rather short temper is expected to make a announcement regarding who should be blamed for this incident...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS10.A;The Socialists and Liberals are to blame. Abolish the constitution!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS10.B;The Reactionaries are to blame. Reform further!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS11.T;The Russian Coup D'etat;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS11.D;The Russian Empire has effectively ended as a military coup, backed by liberal and socialist intellectuals has taken place. These individuals had watched as the worrying trend of tyranny coming from the Tsar was leading to a inevitable collapse of the empire and had successfully pleaded to the military to take action before it was too late. However, in a ironic twist of fate- the provisional government was unable to prevent several regional governors from declaring independence and the empire had effectively completely collapsed anyway. It is now up to the provisional government to reclaim these territories in the hopes that one day it may be able to gain enough legitimacy to end the temporary dictatorship and create a true democracy in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS11.A;From one tyrant, to another.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS12.T;The Future of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS12.D;The Provisional Government has been completely successful in reclaiming the lands that had been lost to the various rogue governors after the military coup. As a direct result of this restoration it has now gained enough legitimacy to have a serious debate about the future of the Russian State and if the Junta should continue, a Democratic Republic be created or the Tsar restored with effectively no power. The ultimate fate of Russia is up to the Provisional Government...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUS13.A;Thus always to tyrants;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS14.T;The Minority Protection Act;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS14.D;With the conclusion of the first partition of the Commonwealth, a proposal has been put forwards regarding granting full Russian Citizenship to all non-polish minorities in the former eastern territories of the Commonwealth. This should strengthen our claim on the territory and prevent further nationalist uprisings in the future that may be to the favour of the Commonwealth. However, this policy is exceptionally radical and many more conservative figures in the Russian Government would prefer if we were to just ignore this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MUS14.A;A bold solution, but one that needs to be taken.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Altay and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Dzungar rule in Altai brought chaos, bands of Altay began plundering and burning Mongolian shops. Altay nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Altay governor, Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Altay.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME44101;The Rong Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44101;The Rong Dynasty was a result of a compromise between a Millenarian Figure known as Li Xiuquing, now known as the Qingzu Emperor, and the various warlords and ancient dynasties scattered around the south of China. Li Xiuquing had failed in his ultimate ambition to once again claim the mandate of heaven but had at least completely dislodged the Southern Ming dynasty from the region. The failure only came as the remaining warlords and dynasties formed a coalition to stop the Taiping Rebellion from completely taking over the south of China with the help of the peasants. As the various individuals following the Taiping religion were ultimately limited in numbers and power and the chances of their survival without a widely recognized leader were too small, Li Xiuquing was  recognize to be the new emperor in the region. The name of the dynasty would be inspired by the ambitions of the followers of the Taiping Faith: the Rong Empire, the ever-prospering and the ever-glorious kingdom in Zhongguo. This claim would ultimately be flimsy at best, nonetheless the Rong Dynasty was born.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The empire that had been created from the many compromises and deals made with the Confucian majority would be known as the Rong Dynasty, a dynasty that was forced to acknowledge Confucian teachings but at the same time teachings of the Taiping religion. This anniversary is remarkable because the most important promise made to the Taiping leadership would be that the Rong Dynasty must embark upon a final conquest of China on this date or run the risk of another rebellion.

This could be achieved by establishing shipyards and arsenals, and by hiring foreign advisers to train Chinese artisans to manufacture such wares in China. As such, the "self-strengtheners" were by and large uninterested in any social reform beyond the scope of economic and military modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCACOL1.D;The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, heir to the Kalmar Union, extends from Scotland to Novgorod, from the Arctic Circle to northern Germany. Following the conclusion of the Great German War, Scandinavia, although making great territorial gains, finds itself in a delicate position. Unrest and separatist nationalism are on the rise from the Highlands of Scotland to the marshes of Finland, fueled by economic decline since the 18th century. King Christian III af Stewart, who ascended the throne after the end of the Great German War, has called the Scandinavian Parliament into session for the first time in years after the absolutist policies of his father. Yet his methods remain authoritarian, with the Landsting in Copenhagen intended as a rubber stamp for the modernizing decisions of the “Enlightened Sovereign of the North” and his cronies gathered in the Unionist clique.

SCACOL2.D;The first modern Landsting was imposed upon the Scandinavian king after the loss of Scotland during the Nine Years War in 1740 and was composed of representatives of the estates of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Following the reconquest of the region in 1771, Scotland joined the Scandinavian realm and thus the united Parliament, much to the dismay of the lairds and burghers who had no choice after the ravages of two wars. The Landsting was dissolved by Alexander III in 1792 and when Christian III announced the reopening of the Landsting in 1825, he made no changes to the electoral map : rotten boroughs remain the norm and the distribution of seats advantage the ‘Three Crowns’, the Scandinavian heartlands while marginalizing Finland, Pomerania and Scotland to a lesser degree. The Liberal opposition has petitioned the King for the last decade and at last he has announced the promulgation of an electoral reform, although the details are not yet known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL2.A;Hopefully the King has heard the complaints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL3.T;The Reform Act of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL3.D;The reopening of the Landsting in 1825 has caused liberals to demand further reforms ever since. We were able to quiet their demands owing to the outbreak of the Krag Rebellion in Vinland in 1827, when Emil Krag, a Cree-Scandinavian radical republican, tried to overthrow the colonial government. This allowed us to tamp down on dissent at home while imposing martial law in the colony to defeat the rebellion (a law which remains in force there). The passage of time allowed reformist sentiments to once more rise to the fore of Scandinavian society, and King Christian III has decided to take action. The new Reform Act has ended the requirement that political parties receive government permission to campaign, as well as lowering property requirements to vote or run for the Landsting. However it has also mandated that all voters pass a Scandinavian literacy test, defended by the Unionster Party as a guarantee that voters are “informed men capable of making informed decisions.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL4.D;With blunder after blunder, ending with the Finnish disaster, the Unionster Party is no longer seen fit to rule the realm, and faces total collapse.

SCACOLN3.T;The Abolition of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOLN3.D;A string of recent events, such as the Bremen Riots and the Reform Act, have made it clear that the Scandinavian government must adapt to survive in this new era. One priority of reformists is the abolition of serfdom. Scandinavian “serfdom” is quite unlike other European forms of the institution but nevertheless they have aroused the ire of liberals. The most notorious is the stavnsbånd, whereby men between 14 and 36 are forced to live on the estates of their birth, an effort by nobles to keep workers from flocking to the cities. Other forms of corvée (unpaid forced labor by peasants) exist across the realm. Now a new measure has been passed abolishing all forms of serfdom throughout Scandinavia. Included in this law is freedom of movement for the peasantry and an end to the “hereditary hierarchy” of farms especially common in western Norway. However the Baltics have been exempted from this measure so as not to provoke rebellion by the Byzantine network of knights and lords in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOLN3.A;Let the people breathe free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOLN4.T;German Nationalist Societies in Holsten;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOLN4.D;The German Revolution of 1790 did not occur at random - rather it was the result of years of agitation and political development by various liberal societies. Now new groups are rising to the fore in Holsten. The two most prominent are the Hermann Society and the Scientific Society for the Exercise of Morality, often simply known as the Morality Society. The Hermann Society is by far the most popular, and many of its members advocate for a unified liberal German nation-state. However while German nationalism is common within the Society its official purpose is to support German art and music, and so far they have carefully concealed any overtly seditious language which could give us reason to shut them down. The Morality Society is more obscure, promoting the collaboration of German scientists and philosophers, but it is rumored to also be a network for German military veterans. Both groups are signs that German nationalism continues to simmer across our southern territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Nobody can say what pushed it over the edge but Scandinavian conservatives are deserting to new parties with more dynamic visions and the Unionster campaign coffers have never been emptier. Stuck in its dogma of autocracy, it is no longer seen fit to rule the realm, and faces total collapse - the once long-ruling and all-powerful party is on its last legs.

SCACOL4D2.D;The Unionster Party, an unnatural creation lashed together by reaction alone, is coming apart due to the loss of royal patronage stemming from the advance of Scandinavian constitutional reforms. Stuck in its dogma of autocracy and reliant upon government favoritism to keep its coffers full and its members in office, it is no longer seen fit to rule the realm, and faces total collapse - the once long-ruling and all-powerful party is on its last legs.

SCACOL4E.T;Rumors of Unionster Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4E.D;The unprecedented weakness of the Unionster Party has stirred new allegations of under-the-table dealings by its members. Be it graft, campaign contributions, or favorable treatment by state regulators, the Party’s members have long been rewarded by the Crown for their support. Now the connections which once kept the government stable threaten to tear it down should they be made public. So many allegations are emerging that only a thorough crackdown on the press can keep hard evidence of Unionster malfeasance - and royal complicity - from coming to light. Of course, the sheer volume of rumors has stirred up some especially ludicrous accusations such as the Party being controlled by a cabal of blood-drinking ghouls, so perhaps people will dismiss the whole affair as hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL4F.T;Mass Protests Against the Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4F.D;News of years of Unionster Party corruption have surged like a Japanese tsunami over Scandinavia, spreading outrage amongst the people. From favorable government contracts to election tampering and industrialist kickbacks, there seems to be no element of Scandinavian society which has not been touched by the cavalcade of scandals. Crowds have descended upon Copenhagen, demanding the immediate abdication of the king, the prosecution of major Unionster and government officials involved in the affair, and the establishment of a liberal, constitutional government. Even Scandinavian conservatives have abandoned any pretense of support, hoping to distance conservatism as a principle from a party which is now universally reviled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4F.A;Christian III’s journal : “Nothing important happened today.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G.T;The Abdication of King Christian III;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G.D;”We have for years been governed by the party of Plutus, the party of unrepentant self-interest and sniveling obedience to despotic whims. Are we free men or, as it was when Attila the Hun stalked Europe, held in bondage by a tyrant and his sycophants? Shall any man in the realm stand for this disgrace? Or shall we fix our attention upon the Royal Palace, and, with one voice, cry, ‘For God’s sake, go!’” - Scandinavian radical Carl Deuntzer\n\nThe revelation of years of massive corruption by the Unionster Party and their royal allies has set Scandinavia aflame. Radicals call for a republic, a notion unthinkable just years ago, and even conservatives demand a new constitution. Facing revolution, King Christian III has abdicated, with his eldest son crowned King Hans IV. The new king has promised to prosecute major Unionster officials and accept a sweeping new liberal constitution to preserve and redeem the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G.A;Long live King Hans IV!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G2.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G2.D;King Hans IV, realizing that the monarchy was at risk of a republican revolution, wasted no time in forming a liberal cabinet. Their first priority was to devise a new constitution that would both enshrine the rights of the people and prevent further epidemics of corruption. The resulting document, drawing on the Burgundian constitution as well as more local forms of Scandinavian democracy, has established a bicameral legislature and reduced the monarch to a ceremonial role. Universal male suffrage has been guaranteed for all citizens, restrictions on public assembly, speech, or publication have been abolished, voting in all elections must henceforth be confidential, and trade unions may freely operate so long as they are registered with the government. This new constitution has been greeted with joyous enthusiasm by Scandinavian citizens - all but the most radical liberals have now dropped their calls for the monarchy’s abolition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4G2.A;A government and a king for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4H.T;Dissolution of the Landsting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4H.D;King Christian III refused to back down in the face of liberal protests. Claiming ignorance of the Unionster Party’s malfeasance while in power, he has dismissed the Unionster-dominated legislature, appointing a more moderate government in its stead. He has also brought up many prominent Unionster Party officials on corruption charges, and urged the new government to pass measures against bribery and illicit campaign financing. However, several leading radical republicans have also been arrested, albeit none for capital offenses. The rage against the monarchy seems to be burning itself out as the newspapers turn to focusing on the dramatic trials of Unionster politicians who were once the titans of Scandinavia. It is doubtful that this is the last we have heard of the reformists but for the time being the monarchy has fought off its challengers and the Stewarts remain masters of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4H.A;All is as it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4I.T;Collapse of the Old Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4I.D;With the complete collapse of the Scandinavian Monarchy or any potencial jingoist successor governments, the Old Order that has governed Scandinavia since Christian III's Unionster Purge is no more. Scandinavia will now attempt to act more diplomatically towards other nations and peoples rather then the hardline and hawkish efforts of the Stuart Dynasty and its successors in their final years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL4I.A;We won't be Icarus anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.T;The Scandinavian Federal Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.D;A new movement has appeared across central Scandinavia, the Scandinavian Federal Movement. They call for an end to the Unitary status quo, which is ancient in nature and doesn't recognize its constituent kingdoms. Their ultimate goal is the abolishment of the Unitary system, in change for a Federalist system with equal representation for the different peoples of Scandinavia. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL5.A;Fringe, at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.T;The Scandinavian Federal Movement Grows;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.D;The once-fringe movement is fringe no more. With the constant and continued failures of the Empire in both internal and external matters, the mainstream Federalist movement has converged into one cohesive party, the Federal Union Party, even if its popularty is negligible at best, the combined efforts of the myriad of smaller Federalist movements have taken effect, giving rise to a noticeable divide between the three main crowns of the Empire, those of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL6.A;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.T;The Demand for Federalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL7.D;The Federal Union, swelling with new members every day and a fringe movement no more, has been petitioning our government both by protest and by letter to finally implement Federalism in Scandinavia once and for all. Which in their opinion will solve the regional divides within our empire and heal our people, who every day drift further away. We could pay heed to the Federal Union, but at what cost? Some of our ruling officials have voiced concerns that giving autonomy to our "less important" states will just drive them towards eventual independence from Scandinavia as a whole, with such a thing being unacceptable. What decision will the government make?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL9.T;Reports from the Scandinavian Federal Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL9.D;The Federal Union, during its inception as a fringe movement and now as an established political force within the empire, has seen radical splinter groups emerge from itself, one of these groups in particular advocates for the complete independence of the feudal kingdoms inhabiting the periphery of the Scandinavian Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL10.A;Troubling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.T;The Rise of the Swedish Realm Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.D;Thanks to the poor decisions of the Government, and the struggle between Federalism and Unitarism, a new Reactionary menace has emerged. The Swedish Realm Party, born from a schism within the reactionary Nordic Realm Party, is rising rapidly in the Scandinvian political sphere. They advocate for a national renewal of the Scandinavian Empire, distancing itself from the passive and conceding nobles in Christiania, and instead opting for a Swedish-Led Scandiavian Empire, with its capital in Stockholm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL11.A;They will never amount to anything! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.T;A Swedish Realm Party Victory...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.D;After their rise, from a fringe splinter group of the Federal Union, and their subsequent swelling and support coming in from disgruntled Swedish and Scandinavian Nationalists, the Swedish Realm Party is projected to win Regional Elections. This is troubling fact, given that the government already holds a tenuous grasp on the various constituents of the Empire, and surely a Scandinavian renewal under absolutist Swedish rule will not quell the dissenters any further. While some circles call for fraud, or outright banning the party, some marginal groups call for national renewal, which they espouse as the salvation that Scandinavia needs to survive. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL12.A;Ban the Swedish Realm Party! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL14.T;The Stockholm Putsch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL14.D;The Swedish Realm Party, with support of the Royal Army and reactionary circles within Scandinavia, have taken over the government apparatus in Stockholm. These news come as no surprise, giving the incredible blunder carried forward by the Scandinavian government in their attempt to rig the elections in their favor. With this, the SRP effectly wrested control of Swedish from the Empire's hold, the fate of Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole hangs in balance, with the revival of long-dead titles and national renewal movements, the future does not seem bright for the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

These were the words heard in the Stockholm Riksdagshuset, As Sweden cut its ties with Scandinavia as a whole. Following Scandinavia's corrupt actions against the democratic apparatus, the SRP took their opportunity. They renounce their claims, opting instead for a national rebirth of the Swedish people as an independent polity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However, this did not go according to plan, following a Federal Union Counter-Coup taking place mere hours after the SRP stormed the Slottet. The Federal Union, however, in a surprising move, has declared the Kalmar Union as void, knowing that Scandinavia as a unified entity is past the point of no return, with this, Norway becomes independent under the radical Federalis regime. Nobody knows what will become of the former great northern empire, but the future doesn't look bright. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL20.D;With the failed Swedish invasion of Norway following the Stockholm Putsch and subsequent Northern Brother's War, Norway has managed to maintain its newfound independence throughout the conflict, besting the Swedish and managing to stave off the Scandinavian desire to restore order over the Norwegian Crown. Without one of its constituents, it is unclear how Scandinavia will continue to function as an entity, but for now, Norway is free, once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCACOL21.T;The End of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL21.D;Following catastrophe and humilliation in the Northern War, the Danish Imperial forces have completely pulled from the front, signing peace with their former brother kingdoms. With officials and different representatives storming in and out of the parliament, plans are being drafted and borders are being redrawn, as Scandinavia comes to an end, the former crowns of Finland, Scotland Karelia, and the various Baltic and North German holdings are free again. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL21.A;Did it really have to end this way...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL22.T;The Scandinavian Population Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL22.D;Scandinavia’s colonial wealth meant that Crown sales of titles and land have been rare, keeping many estates together rather than being parceled apart. The introduction of Red Clover in the 1600s led to an agricultural revolution (Denmark alone has doubled its farm outputs), as soil replenishment led to tool modernization and farm expansion, including the “Grand Reclamation” of swamps and marshes. The result was a larger food supply at lower prices, improving nutrition and thus disease resistance. Animal-borne diseases such as malaria also began to decline. Scandinavia’s early industrialization brought prosperity, including rising urban wages, drawing rural immigrants to cities. More and more, men work in factories, while women work in domestic services, with both fields paying wages far higher than those earned on the farm. The rising urban population has seen marriage and birth rates rise as well, with families living and eating better than many could afford to do so before. All told the Scandinavian population is riding a surging wave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL22.A;A glorious era!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL23.T;The Hollowing and Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL23.D;As our population has increased due to urbanization, the need for new food sources has increased as well. Scandinavia turned to German agriculture, willing to pay high prices to satisfy growing demand. The Great German War and the machinations of the Emperors has, over the last decade, caused a slight stumble in exports to Scandinavia, which we have been trying to reverse. Now the Hollowing, a famine arising from a severe potato blight and economic disarray, is ravaging Germany. It comes at a bad time : we wish to continue our growth, but European protectionism (and political turmoil in Russia) is making it difficult to keep our people well-fed. Yet we do not wish to tread upon local producers by importing cheap grain en masse and reducing our farmers’ income. We could raise our agricultural import limit and provide funding to German estates to preserve their exports, but this would only worsen the famine. If we keep the rates as they are then Germans will at least keep some of the harvests for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL23.A;The grain must flow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME191913;Imperial Alliance has Collapsed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191913;The glorious alliance between Burgundy and Scandinavia has finally collapsed today after the beginning of what is now known as the Parliamentary Crisis. This alliance was first created to fight German revolutionaries and then expanded to fight Bohemian expansion but the collapse of Burgundy into what seems to be a state of civil strife has made it completely impossible to maintain. As a result we have nothing protecting us from Bohemian expansion into Pommerania and it is extremely likely that if Bohemia declared war at this point we would lose badly. We must find alternative alliances as soon as possible or risk the complete destruction of the Baltic Mare Nostrum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Ascending to the throne following the abdication of his father Christan III in the wake of the Unionster Party Scandal he proceeded to reform the government and created a constitution that protected democracy in our country. He spent countless nights ensuring that Scandinavia was protected from any threat and ensured that their North German holdings were secure. News of the King’s death has sent a great sorrow throughout the country, and his funeral was packed with spectators saying goodbye to their monarch. The crown will now pass to Han’s only son, Alexander, who will be formally coronated in a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Ascending to the throne following the abdication of his father Christan III in the wake of the Unionster Party Scandal he proceeded to reform the government and created a constitution that secured democracy in our country. However the loss of Scandinavia’s North German holdings has deeply shaken people’s trust in the crown, and despite Hans’s best efforts he was never able to shake off these perceptions. News of the King’s death has saddened a large number of people throughout the country and a good amount of people attended the King’s funeral.

In the end Christian was able to keep Scandinavia together, a task that seemed almost herculean during his reign. The response to the King’s death has been somewhat muted, but most seem to be sad at hearing of his passing. Due to the earlier unexpected death of Christan’s oldest son Hans, the crown will now pass to Christan’s grandson, Alexander who will be formally coronated in a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The response to the King’s death has been received positively, more specifically, a good amount of people seemed to be happy at hearing of his passing. Due to the earlier unexpected death of Christan’s oldest son Hans, the crown will now pass to Christan’s grandson, Alexander who will be formally coronated in a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL28.A;A few cheers where heard this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL29.T;Alexander V;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL29.D;Alexander has been formally crowned as the new king of Scandinavia taking the regal name of Alexander V. The new king made a speech to his subjects present telling them of the struggles that are plaguing the country currently. Alexander specifically highlighted the increase in socialist ideas as a threat that could throw the country into chaos unless it is combated. Alexander promised that his first action as monarch will be to direct his government to pass laws to ensure stability and protect the people from the threat of socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL29.A;Long Live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL30.T;Alexander V Proposes New Anti-Socialist Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL30.D;Fulfilling his promise from his coronation speech Alexander V has drafted a slew of laws which collectively are being called ‘The Anti-Socialist Laws’. These laws would not only ban all unions in the country, but it would set the stage for a purge of any suspected socialist leaning government officials and public persons by making association with socialist ideas a felony. These laws have been received with concern from the current ruling party which warn Alexander that these laws would never pass in the Landsting. Alexander believes that the strength and the popularity of his position will ensure that they pass, however he has considered an alternative path. He could dissolve the current ruling party and instead install a new Prime Minister and government led by the paternal Officerholdet party, who would then ensure that the laws pass easily. However this would be a direct attack on Scandinavian democracy, however Alexander believed that these laws were needed for the stability of the country. After much debate Alexander knew what path he wanted to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL30.A;Take no chances appoint a new Prime Minister.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL30.B;The government will see that these laws are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
SCACOL31.T;Alexander V Enacts New Anti-Socialist Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL31.D;Fulfilling his promise from his coronation speech Alexander V has drafted a slew of laws which collectively are being called ‘The Anti-Socialist Laws’. These laws would not only ban all unions in the country, but it would set the stage for a purge of any suspected socialist leaning government officials and public persons by making association with socialist ideas a felony. The laws were quickly and easily promulgated after a simple quick reading of the laws. However, some government officials seem uneasy about these new laws and appear reluctant to enforce the laws. Despite this being Alexander's first victory he was not present for most of it due to being afflicted by some stomach virus. Regardless once the king fully recovers the full purge of socialism from Scandinavia can begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL31.A;Nothing can stop Alexander now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
SCACOL32.T;The Decay of Scandinavian Democracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL32.D;To many it wasn't the King's decision to replace the government that shocked them, but the response to it. Specifically there was no response, just silence from anyone who could oppose this action. It had been felt for a while that Scandinavian democracy was more of a farce than an actual institution, but now the King's actions have shown that the people truly have no say in their government. Thanks to Christan III’s rule, the idea of an authoritarian king has become commonplace and even expected from many. The only thing that those who still care about democracy can do now is watch in horror as the king calls the shots in the operation of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL32.A;Is this the end of Democracy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL33.T;Protests Over the New Prime Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL33.D;It appears that Alexander’s actions in trying to pass his Anti-Socialist Laws have sparked large protests. Throughout Copenhagen people protest against the new government and decry the proposed laws as tyrannical overreach. These protests seem to originate from a lack of belief in the infallibility of the king due to the actions of his predecessor. Some of the most vocal protesters come from the market liberal Kolonial Lobby party and their charismatic leader, Poul Sørensen, who has helped to spur many liberal citizens to march with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL33.A;Let them shout.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL34.T;The Anti-Socialist Laws Pass;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL34.D;After forging a government that would cater to his will, Alexander V was able to easily get his Anti-Socialist Laws passed, despite many members of the Landsting refraining from voting. The government held a ceremony over the enactment of the new laws, however Alexander was noticeably absent for most of the ceremony. Rumor has it he has come down with a stomach virus which incapacitated him to a degree. Because of this the purge of government officials has yet to occur, but once he recovers Alexander can fulfill his goal in purging socialism from our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL34.A;Hopefully Alexander recovers soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL35.T;The Anti-Socialist Laws are Rejected;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL35.D;Alexander’s attempt to pass his Anti-Socialist Laws through the Landsting have been met with not only rejection but also mockery. Not only have the laws failed to pass, but they have seemed to have had the opposite effect and have empowered the socialists in the government. A few members of the Landsting have even switched parties to the socialist Folkeslagapartiet in solidarity against the King. While this is a major defeat for Alexander V, he still seemed focused on trying to get his laws passed, and plans to submit them again at a later time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL35.A;This isn’t over, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL36.T;The Anti-Socialist Laws Pass Barely;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL36.D;Thanks in large part to the popularity of the monarchy, Alexander V was able to get his Anti-Socialist Laws passed through the Landsting by a slim margin. This comes after a valiant attempt by a coalition led by the liberal Reformistisk Union party to try and sway members of the Landsting to vote against the bill. However, despite getting the bills passed through the legislature the Hojesteret, supreme court, is challenging the legality of these laws, saying that it goes against protections laid out in the constitution. This has left Alexander V furious and was reported to say “Let them make their decision, and let’s see if they can enforce it”.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL36.A;We must eliminate the red menace;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL37.T;The General Strike of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL37.D;It appears Alexander’s Anti-Socialist Laws have united the people, however they have united them against Alexander. What started as a call for a simple strike by one of the larger unions in the country to demand Alexander drop his Anti-Socialist Laws has now blown up into a general strike. This strike has communists, socialists, liberals, and even dalkists join together to shut down the country to protest against the king. Alexander has remained steadfast in his position and refuses to negotiate with the strikers, calling them traitors to Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL37.A;This is why we need those laws!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL38.T;Calls for a Referendum on the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL38.D;Alexander’s unpopularity due to his recent actions have now made the idea of the abolition of the monarchy, once a fringe idea, a now realistic prospect. Many citizens are demanding that either Alexander abdicate or that the government should launch a referendum on this issue and let the people choose between maintaining the monarchy, or establishing a republic. For the government’s part they are refusing to heed the calls for a referendum fearing that it may destabilize the country, but have remained silent on the idea of abdication. Alexander has also denounced the idea of a referendum and also refuses to abdicate. However due to an apparent stomach virus Alexander is unable to fully fight against this growing movement. It seems that unless something unexpected happens Scandinavia may soon be torn apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL38.A;Tough times ahead;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL39.T;Alexander V has died;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL39.D;Despite not even reaching a year into his reign Alexander V has died due to what his doctors call cholera morbus. An ambitious king, he immediately worked to pass a series of laws known as The Anti-Socialist Laws. These laws were the source of much concern to many people in the Kingdom, however Alexander’s health prevented him from seeing them through to the end. Due to these issues that arose from his reign many people seemed relieved upon hearing of Alexander’s death, with some people celebrating his passing. Unfortunately Alexander did not have any children, and since his father Hans had no other sons, the crown will now pass to Alexander’s younger sister Margrethe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL39.A;Broken Dreams, so grand…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL40.T;Margrethe II The Second Queen of the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL40.D;For the first time in almost 500 years Scandinavia is now ruled by a queen. Taking the name of the founder of the Kalmar Union Margrethe II was formally crowned Queen of Scandinavia. Margrethe was never expected to rule Scandinavia, as a result she was not trained in the running of the country, however the sudden death of her brother Alexander V has thrust that responsibility onto her. Unfortunately, Alexander’s Anti-Socialist Laws have caused instability in the government with some questioning the legitimacy of it. Margrethe’s first choice as the new Queen will have to be to establish a government that she believes will not only stabilize the country also bring it to prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL40.A;Heavy is the head that wears the crown;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL41.T;Absolute Monarchy Reaffirmed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL41.D;In an unexpected turn of events Margrethe II has reaffirmed the absolute nature of the monarchy and her divine right to rule. All governmental institutions have fallen in line as Margrethe’s surprising charisma has unified the government around her. She has promised to continue the policy set forth by her predecessor, and ensure the purge of socialist influence from the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL41.A;God Save the Queen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL42.T;Officerholdet retains control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL42.D;Queen Margrethe has decided to maintain the government that her predecessor established. Using her natural charisma and the popularity of the royal house she has ensured that the Officerholdet government will remain the government in charge. With this full enforcement of Alexander V’s Anti-Socialist Laws will be put into effect soon, with the queen herself making a speech, promising to fulfill the wishes of her dearly departed brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL42.A;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL43.T;The Rött Purge;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL43.D;With the passing of the Anti-Socialist Laws, and the blessing of Margrethe II, a purge has been ordered to remove the red plague of socialism from Scandinavia. Known members of the socialist party are being arrested, along with anyone else suspected of harboring socialist sympathies. All sectors of society are being targeted in this purge including the working class, soldiers, and even members of the nobility. So far, it appears that the purge is having its desired effects and the influence of socialism in Scandinavia appears to have been destroyed as a political force in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL43.A;Order must be maintained;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL44.T;The Kolonial Lobby Form a Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL44.D;With Alexander V trying to bend the government to his will the queen naturally set to work undoing the damage Alexander did. She has dismissed the Officerholdet government and has instead asked Poul Sørensen of the market liberal Kolonial Lobby party to form a government. Sørensen’s actions in working against the Officerholdet government has earned him immense popularity in the country and made him a natural choice in forming a new government. Sørensen has promised a return to democratic government and his government promises to protect Scandinavia’s place in the world and encourage an open and freer market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL44.A;A return to normalcy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL45.T;The Reformistisk Union Form a Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL45.D;Alexander’s obsession in getting the Anti-Socialist Laws enacted has greatly damaged the legitimacy of the government. In order to show that Margrethe is moving away from her brother’s policies she has asked the liberal Reformistisk Union party to form a government. Their actions in leading a coalition in a failed attempt to stop the passing of the Anti-Socialist Laws made them a natural choice in leading the government. As part of a deal in forming a government Margrethe has sent a message to the Hojesteret saying that she acknowledges the court’s ruling and will allow the Anti-Socialist Laws to be repealed. The new liberal government has announced that they will work towards the prosperity of the Scandinavian people as well as working towards strengthening democracy in the country to prevent another Alexander from occuring again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL45.A;A move towards prosperity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL46.T;The Anti-Socialist Laws are Discarded;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL46.D;Alexander’s Anti-Socialist Laws are deeply unpopular bills and with the new government and queen in charge of our country the bills have been formally discarded. Celebrations have been occurring all over Scandinavia in response to the defeat of the bills and normalcy seems to have returned to the country. While some people still decry the spread of socialism in the country the tyrannical overreach from the Anti-Socialist Laws was not a solution and most likely would only have served to further divide the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL46.A;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL47.T;Folkeslagapartiet Forms a Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL47.D;In a shocking twist of events Margrethe II has asked the socialist Folkeslagapartiet to form a government. Alexander’s attempt to pass his Anti-Socialist Laws through the Landsting only empowered the socialists in government making them a major power in the Landsting. Seeing that this would be the best path to reconciliation Margrethe asked the Folkeslagapartiet to form a party that would be loyal to the crown and people of Scandinavia. The Folkeslagapartiet agreed to this and after the formation of their government promised the people to create a government of fraternal unity and move towards a society where all are equal under a democratic government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL47.A;The monarchy seems to be hanging on by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL48.T;Cornelius Blanqui Arrives in Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL48.D;The Folkeslagapartiet, without consulting the queen, has invited Cornelius Blanqui, the author of The Communist Manifesto, to not only take up residence in Copenhagen but also serve in their party. This shocking turn of events appears to be done in part to help the government spread socialist ideas throughout the country by having the main leading figure in the socialist movement take residence in the country. Members in the royal house fear that this is only the first step in a long process towards the abolition of the monarchy. However, Margrethe remembers the damage that her brother Alexander wrought, and so far has refused to comment on recent events for the sake of stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL48.A;Looks like we are officially the home of Socialism now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL49.T;Socialism is Spreading;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL49.D;With the rise of urbanization there has been a new ideological movement growing within the working class. Socialism has been spread amongst this group with the promises of better working conditions, better governmental services, and equality regardless of one's class. While some are concerned about the spreading of these ideas, most in the government do not see this as an issue and instead believe that it is more of a fad that will soon pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL49.A;Nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL50.T;Socialist Parties on the Rise;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL50.D;What was thought to be a passing fad has instead become a powerful movement. Publications from various socialist authors have wound up in the hands of the working class and new socialist politicians are running for many positions in government. The socialist Folkeslagapartiet have taken the forefront in political socialist sphere and their chairman, Anker Hørdum, has become a charismatic leader around which the socialist parties are rallying around.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL50.A;Ok, now this is something to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL51.T;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL51.D;When Margrethe II ascended to the throne, she realized that she had to take steps to restore people’s faith in the government and the royal house. To this end she asked for a new constitution to be drawn up, with the express purpose of giving more power to the people, while making the position of monarch more of a figurehead. This new constitution grants universal male suffrage for all citizens, abolishes restrictions on public assembly, speech, or publications, ensures voting in all elections will be confidential, and that trade unions may freely operate without government interference. With this constitution Margrethe hopes that this will silence the calls for the abolition of the monarchy and ensure democracy and stability for the people in her country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCACOL51.A;With this democracy is secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Instead we will force the Balters into an autonomous status tied to our nation. While all border and customs controls between our lands will be abolished, and our government will handle all of their diplomatic and military affairs, they will remain internally sovereign. The ultranationalists will be disappointed but this is the best compromise we can manage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCALAT1.T;Livland in $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT1.D;Ever since we finished our conquest of Livland - a ‘pars pro toto’ referring to Estland, Livland proper, and Kurland and Semgallen, together as a unit - in the prior century, we have avoided interference in its political order. This has left the German-dominated feudal system which arose during the Northern Crusades of the XIIth century in place. Livland is thus a labyrinthine patchwork of noble estates, dominated by the four Baltic Knighthoods of Estland, Livland, Kurland and Semgallen, and Osel, to which all noblemen belong. The Balters (Baltic Germans) enjoy great autonomy and keep the natives under a brutal regime of exploitation and assimilation. §BAs long as the ultra-reactionary Balters are left in power, they will fight to maintain their old privileges. Only a comprehensive assault upon the entire Balter social order, in both Livland and Prussia, could end their rule.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCALAT2.T;The Way of the Balters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCALAT2.A;We will keep the natives in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT3.T;The Balters Demand Old Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT3.D;The Balters are outraged by our attacks upon their feudal codes. They have pointed to numerous laws and treaties created in the past by which our ancestors conferred upon them "eternal" rights and autonomy. Even if we were to disregard these old agreements, the Balters have such a monopoly upon local governance in their homelands that it would be impossible to enforce our restrictions. Most of the cabinet believes that we must reverse course until a more permanent solution to the Balters' codes can be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT3.A;If we must…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT4.T;A Baltic Solution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT4.D;With the Finnish crisis resolved, national attention is now turning to Livland. This region has been a maze of feudalism for centuries, with all power held by the Balter nobility and middle class. This arrangement is becoming intolerable for a modern nation such as ours. The time has come to consider how to address the "Baltic Question," lest a foreign power answer it for us. After all, Livland commands a position of great geographical value, and has always been a tempting target. If we do not come to a resolution soon, the Livlanders might seek independence with the aid of a foreign power - they have laid such schemes in the past, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT4.A; Something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT5.T;The Grand Reduction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT5.D;The left-wing parties are reaching a consensus : Livland's feudal Balter order must come to an end. So long as it persists, the Baltic natives will never be free, and our nation will be plagued by a reactionary cancer. A plan is now circulating among liberal and socialist authors which calls for the dissolution of all Balter lands and their transfer to their tenants. It also calls for the replacement of the Baltic provinces with new states of Estonia and Latvia, ones with all residents, regardless of class, religion, or ethnicity, represented in regional assemblies. If the government were to announce its support for the proposal, it would win us the eternal loyalty of the Balts - but also the eternal hatred of the Balters and their reactionary allies elsewhere in our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT5.A;We must strive to end the Balts' oppression!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT5.B;This would only cause needless instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT6.T; Aftermath of the Finnish Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT6.D;We have weathered the Finnish storm. This has strengthened our position in the east and opens the door into further power projection in the Baltic Sea. At the same time we must prevent similar crises from arising in the future - such as in Livland. Liberals within the empire have been raising the issue of the Balters and their supposed repression of the natives. Needless to say this talk must end at once. The Balters are some of our greatest allies, and we must preserve the Germanic order in the east. Still, a permanent policy for Livland will have to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT6.A;We must solve the Baltic Question…eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT7.T;The Riga Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT7.D;King Christian appeared in Riga today, to the delight of the peoples of Livland. After being received by the Archbishop of Riga, the king gave an eloquent address in which he urged the Livlanders to remain united in the name of "the honor of the nation, of the holy Protestant faith, and of your everlasting fidelity to Us and to Our government." His heartfelt appeal to the Livlanders and their shared religious ties seem to have calmed immediate tensions. However in the aftermath of his visit, it has become clear that the government sees no need to change the Livlander political order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT7.A;Why fix that which is not broken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT8.T;The Aftermath of the Finnish Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT8.D;The calamity in Finland has forced us to reevaluate our policies in other sensitive areas of the realm, such as Livland. It is now clear that regions we once assumed to be safely assimilated may in fact be in danger of nationalist unrest. Livland is no exception, as the Finnish national awakening has also fed into Estonian and in turn Latvian cultural revivals. The Balters also remain aloof, defiant of any attempt to rein them in and bring order to their feudal domain. We must come up with a solution to prevent another national crisis between the natives and the Germanic ruling class - preferably by cementing Scandinavian culture in Livland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT8.A;We must solve the Baltic Question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT9.T; Remembering the Uniformity Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT9.D;Our men at the interior ministry have dredged up an old policy from the 17th century which attempted to assimilate Livland. Known as the "uniformity policy," it sought to impose Scandinavian laws throughout Livland, including the usage of the Scandinavian language in all government and religious documents. The policy was hated by the Balters and withdrawn after several influential Balter lords were caught reaching out to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for support against the Crown. Nevertheless it was the most aggressive attempt by the Crown to assimilate Livland. Given our growing dissatisfaction with the Balters' conduct, such a policy could be useful if applied through modern methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT9.A;Perhaps its time is not yet over…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT10.T;The New Uniformity Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT10.D;The conservative parties are reaching a consensus : Livland's feudal Balter order must come to an end. So long as it persists, the Balters will never truly accept our rule, and their cruelty will drive the natives to revolt. A plan is now circulating amongst conservative authors which calls for the unilateral imposition of Scandinavian law into Livland. This would include the dissolution of all Balter lands and their redistribution to Estonian, Latvian, and Scandinavian tenants. It also calls for the imposition of Scandinavian as the main language of the Livlander government, schools, and churches, with a possible option for Nordic-Baltic bilingualism. In short, a revival of the Uniformity Policy, but one which goes even further. If the government were to announce its support for the proposal, it could finally assimilate Livland - but it would also earn us the hatred of both the Balters and the nascent Baltic nationalist movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT10.A;We must make Livland Scandinavian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT10.B;This would only cause needless instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT11.T;The Ailing Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT11.D;We have been unable to decide upon a solution to our problems in Livland. The growth of Baltic nationalist movements cannot be denied. Yet the Balters have refused to relinquish any political or economic power to the natives. For the time being, the Balters and the power of the Church of Scandinavia should be able to preserve order in Livland. This is not a salve, but a bandage. If our realm is ever destabilized by the loss of important territory - such as Pomerania - and if we do not expand our political horizon enough to adopt more radical tactics to address Livland, then we may lose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT11.A;What, me worry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT12.T; Foundation of the Estonian Salvation Committee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT12.D; Estonian nationalism has been on the rise ever since the publication of the Kalevala and the subsequent Finnish national awakening. The Estonian are closely related to the Finns, and the struggles of their northern kin have emboldened them. A new group known as the Estonian Salvation Committee has been formed out of a merger of multiple smaller Estonian nationalist organizations. The Committee, like most Balts, is disturbed by the rise of a powerful Slavic state on our frontier with Baltic ambitions. Therefore they demand the recognition of the Estonian people as Scandinavians, the creation of a Duchy of Estonia encompassing all Estonian speakers , and granting Estonians full citizenship. The Balters have of course vowed to oppose any challenges to their monopoly upon political and economic power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT12.A;We must not destabilize Livland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT13.T;The Purge of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT13.D;The Balters had vowed to oppose the ESC, but only now do we realize what they meant by such statements. This morning we were informed that the four Baltic Knighthoods have organized German militias to purge the local government of all non-German influence! Any Scandinavian, Estonian, or Latvian holding a government job has been placed under arrest. The Duchies of Estland, Livland, and Kurland and Semgallen have all been swept up in this wave of hysteria. Our forces stationed in the east have fortified their barracks, and we are attempting to make contact with the provincial governors to force them to restore order. Given that nearly all of their forces are Balters, however, such orders are unlikely to be carried out even if we could relay them. This is a matter that will not be solved quickly….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT13.A;Those ignorant fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT14.T;The Baltic Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT14.D;Initial attempts at negotiation between Copenhagen and representatives of the four Baltic Knighthoods have hit a wall. The Balters are horrified at the growth of Baltic nationalism, and blame Copenhagen for preventing them from taking aggressive measures to stamp out the rise of Estonian and Latvian national identities. Our loyalists in Estland, Livland, and Kurland and Semgallen have accused the Balters of keeping the natives in a degraded condition of serfdom and silence that has given the Balts no other option but organized agitation to make their voice heard. Regardless of these accusations, action must be taken quickly to put a stop to this insurrection. Many Balters would prefer independence to seeing the destruction of their feudal order, and if we do not grant them a form of autonomy which satisfies their desires, then they will likely seek foreign support for their secession from Scandinavia. Time is running out, and the Balters, self-serving as always, will surely go to any possible length to defend their privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT14.A;We cannot let Livland slip away…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT15.T;The Balterland Solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT15.D;The interior ministry has put forth a plan to defuse the current crisis. They have proposed that we reorganize the eastern territories of Estland, Livland, Kurland and Semgallen, and Prussia into a single “United Duchy of Balterland,” bringing all of the Balter-ruled territories into a single unit. This would prove a formidable counterweight to Baltic nationalism, and would give us an excuse to push the medieval systems in Prussia and Livland towards a more modern framework as a condition of Balterland’s formation. In the future - when the Slavs have been pacified to such an extent that they pose no threat to our control of the Østersøen - we may be able to reintegrate the Balters, once they are convinced of their place within our domain. §RWhile the plan would mean decentralizing our eastern possessions it may be our only hope of preventing a Livlander secession.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT15.A;Compromising with the Balters got us into this mess! Never again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT15.B;If that is what it will take to keep order in Livland, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT16.T;The Creation of Balterland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT16.D;The Balters were quick to accept our proposal to end the Baltic Crisis, and we have now restored balance to Livland. “Balterland” has been formed out of the four Balter-ruled states under our control, comprising eight cantons, each with their own Landtags and Land Colleges, as well as the autonomous City of Riga. There is also a unified Landtag and a Convent of the Land Administrators, with each section of the Landtag overseen by a Land Marshal. The Land Colleges and the Convent are appointed by the four Baltic Knighthoods, and above both stands our governor, who has the power of judicial and executive appointment, and other powers of executive prerogative. It is a complicated system, but it shall keep the Balters in line until the threat of the Slavs - be they Polish or Russian - have been dealt with, and we can convince the Balters to reintegrate into our realm. §RIn the unlikely event that a unified Germany emerges, they could induce the Balters to revolt if their influence within the state becomes overwhelming.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT16.A;Let us hope this arrangement is indeed temporary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT17.T;The Riga Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT17.D;The Balters have made their move. The Baltic Knighthoods assembled in Riga and, after hours of debate, concluded that Copenhagen had no intention of granting them autonomy. Thus they have resorted to secession! Paternalist forces have purged any remaining Scandinavian loyalists from Riga and seized the city, and with it the economic and political heart of Livland. Orders have been given to the Balter militias to occupy government offices across the Duchies of Estland, Livland, and Kurland and Semgallen, and the Scandinavian flag has been hauled down. In its place has been raised a new banner : that of the Free State of Livland. Duke Alfred III von Ungern-Sternberg has been acclaimed as Stadtholder by the Baltic Knighthoods, and has proclaimed his intent to “defend the ancient rights of the Balter people, won by the Teutonic sword.” Given that the Balters comprise a small minority within the insurrectionary state, he will almost certainly seek help from the Russians and the Poles. Whether or not they choose to aid him, we must now prepare to put down the Balter treason by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT17.A;They WILL regret this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT18.T;The Livonian Plea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT18.D;The Baltic Germans (or Balters) of Livonia have recently rebelled against their Scandinavian overlords due to Copenhagen refusing to address the rise of Estonian and Latvian nationalism. They have declared independence, but Scandinavia has declared this illegal, and is mustering their armies to restore order to the provinces. Thus the Balters have turned to us for aid. The Livonian Balters sought our aid before in the 17th century, when Scandinavia’s assimilationist “Uniformity Policy” provoked the Balters to open negotiations with the Commonwealth for a possible defection to us. In the end the matter fell through but now we have another opportunity to swipe the Baltic states away from Scandinavia. Of course, even if our intention is to claim Livonia outright, we will have to obscure such a motive when dealing with the Balters - and once they discover our intentions, they will doubtlessly resist us. Still, this may be our last chance to keep Livonia out of Scandinavian - or Russian - hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT18.A;Of course, we shall “defend” Livonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT18.B;We cannot spare any resources at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Livonian Balters have more than once turned to Russian aid to safeguard them against Scandinavia and Poland, and this time appears no different, giving us a chance to swipe the Baltic states away from Scandinavia. Of course, even if our intention is to claim Livonia outright, we will have to obscure such a motive when dealing with the Balters - and once they discover our intentions, they will doubtlessly resist us.

SCALAT20.T;The Third Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT20.D;Livonia has been a coveted prize for the nations of northeastern Europe since the Northern Crusades of the 13th century. The Scandinavians, the Poles, the Germans, and the Russians have all vied for dominance, with the native Balts always caught in the middle. Now the Baltic states have once again ignited an international crisis. The Balters, accusing Scandinavia of allowing Estonian and Latvian nationalism to fester, have severed all ties with Copenhagen and declared independence. As in the past, the Balters of Livonia have looked to the Russians and the Poles for aid against Scandinavia. The Nordics, who have already fought two wars in the past against the Slavs for control of the Baltic states, will surely not abandon Livonia easily. As the Scandinavian lion, the Polish eagle, and the Russian bear cast their gaze towards the Baltics, the Germans and the Balts can only wonder at what the future holds : freedom for their people, or another century of oppression?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT20.A;Livonia belongs to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT21.T;The End of Livonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT21.D;Victory is ours! Neither the Poles nor the Russians were able to defend the Balters from our retribution. The so-called “Stadtholder” Duke Alfred III von Ungern-Sternberg will face treason charges in Copenhagen, with a life sentence on a cold Atlantic island the probable result. With the insurrection at an end, the time has come to tear out the Balter power structure by the roots. All four Baltic Knighthoods have been dissolved, and all lands held by Balters in Livonia have been seized by the government for redistribution to their Baltic tenants. The three duchies have been reorganized into the provinces of Estonia and Latvia, with state legislatures composed of elected representatives. Most important of all, the Estonians and Latvians have been enfranchised as full Scandinavian citizens. While it is doubtful that the Balters will ever truly forgive us for destroying their feudal enterprise, we have proven our fidelity to the Balts, and they have renewed their faith in Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT21.A;The Baltics are waking up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

With the insurrection at an end, the time has come to tear out the Balter power structure by the roots. All four Baltic Knighthoods have been dissolved, and all Livonian Balter lands have been seized by the government for redistribution, either to Baltic tenants or to new Scandinavian settlers. The three duchies have been reorganized into the provinces of Estonia and Latvia, with state legislatures composed of elected representatives. Most important of all, the Balters’ medieval codes have been replaced by modern Scandinavian law, including the full enfranchisement of all Estonians and Latvians. While it is doubtful that the Balters will ever truly forgive us for destroying their feudal enterprise, we have finally brought civilization to Livonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT22.A;Livonia shall be ours forevermore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT23.T;Defeat in the Third Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT23.D;It seems impossible, but it is true : We have been defeated by Scandinavia. Our attempts to take control of the Baltic states have been thwarted, and now we must face the consequences. The resulting peace treaty forced us to disavow all claims not only to Livonia, but to Finland and even to Karelia! This is an outrage, but the international community is united behind Scandinavia for the moment, and thus we must bear this indignity for now. In the future, we may be able to proclaim the treaty annulled and renew our defense of our northern frontier. For now, however, we must turn our gaze elsewhere, and work to rekindle the spirit of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT23.A;We will not be denied…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT24.T;Defeat in the Third Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The resulting peace treaty forced us to disavow all claims to Livonia, and Scandinavia, after almost three hundred years of struggle, has finally forced us out of the Baltic states. This likely marks the end of our designs on Livonia. Even if we repudiate this treaty in the future, the Balts are unlikely to see us as anything but foreign conquerors..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT24.A;The problem with the Baltics is that they’re full of Balts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT25.T;Victory in the Third Livlander War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT25.D;Freedom at last! After centuries of being a mere pawn in Scandinavia’s game, we have cast off the Nordic yoke and defended our ancient rights in the process. Livland stands tall and unbowed, resting upon the unbreakable strength of her Teutonic heritage. The only question now is whether we may have to face additional challenges from the Slavs. To be sure, the Poles and the Russians supported our independence, but we never had any illusions as to their motives. As in the past, they likely covet our lands for themselves. Therefore we must not rest yet - Livland, so newly free, must extend her vigil, and keep watch for the Polish eagle and the Russian bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT25.A;Lang lebe Livland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT26.T;The End of Scandinavian Livonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT26.D;Livonia has become so estranged from our nation that any restoration of the old order in the Baltic states is now impossible. The last remnants of Scandinavian loyalism within Livonia have faded away, replaced with a newfound nationalism sparked by Livonia’s new masters. Even the Baltic Lutheran Church has divorced itself from Copenhagen, stripping away what was once a crucial pillar of support of our rule in Livonia. While the Scandinavian language is still spoken by a slowly declining number of Livonians, the Scandinavian flag no longer stirs any passion within their hearts. Livonia is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT26.A;Another page of European history written, filled, and turned…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT27.T;Victory in the Third Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT27.D;Scandinavia has been driven from the Baltic states at last! Now that Livonia is independent, we can move on to the next phase of our strategy. Contact has been established with several notable Balter families who hold no love for the Livlander Stadtholder, Duke Alfred III von Ungern-Sternberg, a man rumored to be something of a megalomaniac. Stadtholder Alfred’s rumored plans for an “Eastern State” stretching from Stolp to the Gulf of Finland have alienated many supporters, and now that Scandinavia has been repelled, they are eager for a change in leadership.While the logical idea is to strike north and “liberate” Livonia from the Stadtholder’s whims, it might be simpler to merely force Alfred to resign. This would greatly calm the Prussians and more importantly would preempt any attempt by the Balters to seek German aid against us, §Rwhich they might do if we attack them now.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCALAT29.T;A Crisis in the Baltic Governorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT29.D;We had hoped that the removal of the “Ostland” faction of Balters from power after our liberation of the Baltic states would have forced the rest of the nobility into line. This has proven to have been a naive assessment of German greed.The Balters continue to crush any attempt by the Estonians and the Latvians to participate in local politics or even use their native languages. One Colonel Ivan Gerasimov in Pskov has written to us recently with alarm, noting that the Balters have begun to quietly reform their old Scandinavian-era militias. Worse, the governor - himself a Balter, as are most of the governorate’s officials - recently approved a measure mandating that all government documents be written not in Russian, but in German! Several ministers assure us that this is how it was done under Scandinavian rule, but others have urged us to declare the governorate to be in a state of insurrection, and to use military force to break the Balters’ power for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT29.A;The Balters have gone too far, and must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT29.B;Mandate Russian-German bilingualism in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT300.T;The Ruins of Balter Livonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT300.D;For over five hundred years, Livonia was held in the death grip of the Balter upper- and middle-classes - but no longer. It has been quite a few years since a Balter noble was able to abuse their subjects with wild abandon, or a Balter merchant able to deny an Estonian or Latvian customer business on the grounds of their ethnicity. Local schools, bookstores, and libraries boast growing numbers of Estonian and Latvian works. Even the Baltic Lutheran Church now holds services in native languages, and more and more of the local priesthood reflect their communities at large, not just the leading men. Simply put, we cannot replicate Scandinavian strategies of control in the Baltics. We must find ways to work with the Estonians and the Latvians if we are to integrate Livonia into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT300.A;The Teutonic ghost, exorcized at last…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT30.T;Our Baltic Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT30.D;Through peace or force, we have managed to assume hegemony over Livonia. The only question now is how to integrate it. The Estonians and the Latvians would certainly welcome the end of their servitude beneath the infamously despotic and reactionary Balter (Baltic German) elite. However, a direct assault upon the Balter power structure would outrage the Prussians and could invite outside intervention from the Germans. The Balters are nothing if not self-preserving and would likely seek aid from a German power, if one exists, to defend themselves from us. Therefore it might be simpler if we offered the Balters of Livonia the same privileges which the Prussians enjoy, and induce them to submit to our authority without bloodshed. This would of course condemn the Balts to continued servitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT30.A;Livonia must be ours without question!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT30.B;We have worked with Balters before, let us accommodate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT31.T;The Balters are Under Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT31.D;The fortress of German civilization in eastern Europe is facing its darkest hour, as the foreign hordes have declared war upon the Livlanders. If Livland falls then we, too, will likely be next, and with us will perish the Teutonic legacy. There is an alternative. Our protectors in the German fatherland might be able to protect both ourselves and our Livlander brothers. If we can convince them to intervene in Livland’s defense, then perhaps we could at last realize the dream of the Teutonic Knights, and become the centerpiece of a pan-Balter state stretching from the Prussian frontier all the way to the Gulf of Finland. Shall we issue the call to the westerners?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT31.A;Ja!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT31.B;Nein, the Livlanders are no friends of ours…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT32.T;A Final Northern Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT32.D;The Balters (Baltic Germans) of Livland have come under attack from foreign forces seeking to drive them out of power. Thus they have turned to the Prussians, and through the Prussians to us, for protection. The Prussians relate that the Livlanders would be open to merging their domain with Prussia to form a unified “Balterland” or “Ostland”, as it is variously known by its proponents, if we save them from destruction. Contrary to the lofty aspirations of German ultranationalists, it is unlikely that we could actually annex such a state after its formation. Yet it would still prove a steadfast subject, and would cement German dominance across the Ostsee. How should we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT32.A;Ostland shall not fall to the barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT32.B;Leave the remnants of those dog-knights to their fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT33.T;The German Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT33.D;We knew that standing against the Slavs would be a dangerous endeavor. Therefore we reached out to the Prussians and their German backers with a proposal : if Germany protected us against our foes, we would unify with the Prussians into a single pan-Balter state. While in centuries past the Prussians attempted to force our ancestors in the Livlandischer Order into lockstep obedience, this new state would be an equal partnership between the Balters of the north and the south. The ink on the agreement has already been signed, and now we must stand firm against the savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT33.A;Ostland will not fall to the barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT34.T;Germania Heeds our Call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT34.D;The westerners have confirmed their support for our endeavors! They shall defend the Balter people with all of their strength. This news has been communicated to the Livlanders, who have agreed to unify our domains and coordinate on a common defensive strategy. While the entrance of Germany into this struggle will no doubt escalate it to titanic proportions, we are nevertheless poised to accomplish that which no Grandmaster ever could, and bridge the gap between Prussia and Livonia for the final time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT34.A;We must do what Hermann of Dorpat could not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT35.T;German Intervention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT35.D;The Livonian Balters have pulled off a scheme even more outrageous than we could have expected. Working with the Balters of Prussia, they have unified their nations into a single pan-Balter state! This nation has in turn inherited Prussia’s protection by the Germans. Therefore the Germans have now made the ludicrous assertion that if we do not back down, a state of war will have existed between us! While we had anticipated that the Balters would employ underhanded tactics to preserve their feudal order, we did not expect a direct threat of war from the Germans. To submit to their demands would mean allowing Livonia to pass into German hegemony. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT35.A;THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCALAT35.B;We have no choice but to back down…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Behold, they sent you two swords, the swords of violence and of pride, and have lost many thousands of them, having been utterly defeated.” - Jan Hus, letter to King Wladyslaw II congratulating him for defeating the Teutonic Order at the Battle of Grunwald, 1411\n\nThe Balters of Livonia have played their final gamble to preserve their power. With the Slavs at their gates, they have turned to their German kin for protection, unifying with the Prussians to form a united Balter state. The ruins of Scandinavia’s empire are host to yet another imperial clash, as both the Germans and their rivals seek sole control over the region. Whoever prevails shall hold the key to the Baltic Sea, and with it the future of northern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCALAT37.T;Administrating Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCALAT37.D;We have taken possession of Lithuania, including Vilnius, the “Jerusalem of the North.” The main question is how we will administer Lithuania going forwards. The military has proposed that we simply proclaim Lithuania’s annexation, forgoing integration in the name of keeping order. The interior ministry meanwhile is split between Nordicists who urge us to establish the Balters as the new ruling class in Lithuania, and pragmatists who advise using the “Samogitian” nationalist movement to create an autonomous territory which could be reabsorbed if negotiations with the Latvians are successful. §RThe latter two plans may fail if we do not compromise with either the Balters or the Balts in the future.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
SCALAT37.A;It is fine as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SCALAT38.T;Administrating Samogitia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCALAT38.D;We have taken possession of Samogitia. The main question is how we will administer it going forwards. The military has proposed that we simply proclaim Samogitia’s annexation, forgoing integration in the name of keeping order. The interior ministry meanwhile is split between Nordicists who urge us to establish the Balters as the new ruling class in Samogitia, and pragmatists who advise creating an autonomous Samogitian territory which could be reabsorbed if negotiations with the Latvians are successful. §RThe latter two plans may fail if we do not compromise with either the Balters or the Balts in the future.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HAGGIS01.T;National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS01.D;The resurgence of liberalism across Europe has stirred Scottish intellectuals. Many feel embittered at the government’s focus upon Germany rather than the Stewart homeland. Leading Scottish liberals have now formed the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights. The group’s founding manifesto asserts that Scandinavia’s German lands have consistently received more generous treatment than Scotland. This is in spite, they say, of Scotland having its own pressing issues : extortionate Highland clan leaders, a crime-ridden English border, antiquated ports…They demand that Scandinavia always be styled “the United Kingdom” and that Scotland should be allotted more seats in the Landsting. These are minor concerns but it could open the door to a rise in Scottish nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAGGIS02.D;The growth of Scandinavian democracy and federalism have also allowed nationalist parties to grow. Such is the case in the Folketing, where the Scottish Home Rule League has recently gained seats. The League formed out of the failed Scottish Repeal Association, a short-lived group which wanted to end the Act of Union and create an  independent Scotland sharing only Scandinavia’s monarch. The more moderate League instead seeks “Home Rule” (a term borrowed from Irish reformists), the restoration of the old Pairlament of Scotland which was abolished by the Act of Union. League representatives have taken pains to stress that they, unlike the Repealers, are opposed to full Scottish independence and merely wish for Scotland to have “the voice which she once possessed and still deserves.” Nevertheless their electoral success has emboldened Scottish nationalism. §RIf a position as moderate as Home Rule cannot bring Scotland more rights, then Scottish nationalism may become truly militant…§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAGGIS03.D;The drastic consolidation of royal power has triggered mass demonstrations across urban Scotland. Glasgow has seen the largest protests, with activists decrying the suppression of Scottish culture and local institutions by the Scandinavian regime. Where Scottish liberals once called for “Home Rule,” or autonomy within Scandinavia, their demands have shifted. The Scottish National Party, heirs to the Scottish Repeal Association, has formed to advocate for the repeal of the Act of Union and the creation of an entirely independent Scottish republic. The SNP has denounced the Stewarts as “traitors to the Scottish people'' and has demanded that Scotland “liberate herself from Scandinavian tyranny.” To defend against government repression, the SNP has formed an underground paramilitary wing, the Scottish Republican Army, modeled on similar organizations in Ireland and England. Many Scots are starting to see the SNP as their only option to defend and reclaim their liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has also been a rise in highly suspicious fires in government offices in the area.

HAGGIS14.T;The Royal Visit of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS14.D;All of Scotland is filled with energy as the Stewards have for the first time in generations returned to the isle in triumph. Welcomed by cheering crowds in Edinburgh, the monarch and their family have spent days touring the major cities of Scotland as well as the highlands and even the outer islands. No expense was spared decorating for the occasion, with some particularly romantic Scots donning traditional garb for the occasion. The Stewarts also visited some of the new communities being constructed in the Highlands to reverse the degradation of the area due to the Clearances. Many regional Scottish officials are speaking of making today a Scottish cultural holiday going forward, and it seems that Scotland has truly embraced both the Stewarts and Scandinavia. This opens up the potential of advancing our position in the Anglo-Celtic Isles, long a dream of the Stewarts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAGGIS15.T;The Scottish Covenant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS15.D;The last election saw the Scottish Home Rule League win an unprecedented landslide victory in Scotland, claiming every Scottish seat in the Folketing. Their members have now brought forth a petition for autonomy known as the Scottish Covenant. The document bears the signature of thousands and thousands of Scots, from the wealthiest elites to the poorest of the poor, in support of restoring the Pairlament of Scotland. The choice of the name “Covenant” is a politically charged one. It recalls the Covenanters who took up arms to support Scottish Presbyterianism against Anglois-backed Catholic rule in Scotland during the Stewart-Castlemaine era of the 18th century. Thus the name is also, in essence, a threat : §RScottish nationalists have gained political hegemony across Scotland. Refusing them autonomy could provoke them into declaring independence.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current members are a caretaker government until new Scottish elections are held. Members of Pairlament all must swear an oath of allegiance to the Scandinavian monarch in order to hold office, and the Scandinavian flag is displayed opposite to that of Scotland within the legislature’s chambers. The Scottish Home Rule League has dissolved now that it has accomplished its goal, with its members joining new parties with broader platforms. It is hoped that this will provoke a split between hardcore Scottish nationalists and moderates who want to work within the bounds of the law to support their culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disillusioned reformists have turned to the Scottish National Party, a Dahlkist group inspired by Irish and English nationalists, and its Scottish Republican Army. A group of SRA militants stormed the Edinburgh General Post Office this morning, where their leader, Tavish Mac Dòmhnaill, read out a proclamation declaring a Scottish republic!

Many are saying that the Nordics are correct in their assertion that the Scottish stand no chance on their own, but there is a chance that the present government in England has backed this rebellion - Scandinavia could easily find itself in a fight it cannot win.

HAGGIS20.D;For the first time since the Act of Union, the House of Stewart once again reigns from Holyrood. The royal family was able to evade the members of the new government who sought to punish them for their misrule, and sailed away under cover of darkness back to Scotland, taking with them the Scottish Crown Jewels and the Stone of Scone, the sandstone block used in the coronation of Scottish kings for centuries. The old Scandinavian monarch has since declared himself King of a restored Scotland! To placate Scottish nationalists he has accepted a sweeping liberal constitution and promised to “atone for the actions and inactions of previous governments” by defending Scottish rights and culture. Our control across the Anglo-Celtic Isles has been shattered, and any areas outside of the old Scottish crown lands will likely fall under the sway of regional governors seizing power for themselves - if the new Kingdom of Scotland does not subjugate them in its quest for new power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resolve_the_Scottish_problem_title;Resolve the Scottish problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Resolve_the_Scottish_problem_desc;No Stewart King has graced the lands of their ancestors since the end of the Anglo-French War of Succession and the ousting of the Catholic Stewart-Castlemaine traitors who had been placed on the throne by Paris. The memory of “Bonnie” Prince Alexander who fought alongside the Highland clans against Catholic oppression still is remembered fondly throughout the country and most Scottish still hold allegiance to the house of Stewart. A royal visit to the country would likely appease the Scottish nationalists, however it cannot be an empty gesture but the culmination of our efforts to develop and integrate the land.\n§RIf we do not resolve the issues plaguing Scotland before 1875, the revolutionaries could gain momentum and try to proclaim the independence of the country§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Create_the_North_Sea_Company_title;Create the Royal North Sea Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Create_the_North_Sea_Company_desc;The distance between Scotland and Scandinavia is more than just physical. Passenger travel between the two regions is unreliable at best, not to mention expensive. Rates are prone to wild swings as the routes are dominated by a few private companies always squabbling with one another. Let us issue a charter to a new Royal North Sea Company to establish safe, consistent, and reasonably priced travel between Scotland and the mainland. This shall greatly increase the social and economic integration of Scotland into our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Amend_the_Clearance_title;Invest in the Highlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Amend_the_Clearance_desc;Northern Scotland has been subjected to the Highland Clearances, a period where Scottish clan leaders began forcing the eviction of crofters (landless peasants) and sending them south in order to use their lands for sheep herding, to cash in on the booming wool trade. This was also a time when clan leaders’ view of themselves changed : formerly the keystones of Scottish Highland communities, they sought to redefine themselves as a more traditional European aristocracy. Both trends were supported by the Scandinavian government, which sought to consolidate control of the Highlands. The feuds of this era were a factor in the deportation of the Mackay, Dunbar, and Fraser clans’ deportation to Sydoe by the Stewarts. The simplest way to rejuvenate the area would be by modern housing and infrastructure in the Highlands, subsidizing small farmers and providing them with new tools and fertilizers, and sponsoring resettlement there by urban Scots wishing to escape overcrowded cities, especially those descended from cottars (peasants) evicted during the Lowland Clearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Man_the_Border_title;Man the English Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Man_the_Border_desc;The Scottish-English border has been especially perilous since the late 13th century. Generations of heavily-armed families on both sides of the divide, the border reivers, switch allegiances like weathervanes, raiding north or south depending on who will protect them. While major raids are now almost unheard of, the region is still quite lawless and filled with smugglers - not to mention vulnerable to an invasion from the south. We must construct a new series of fortifications and secure harbors along the English border, both to defend Scotland and to finally bring order to the border country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

develop_elbe_weser_desc;Northern Germany has been ravaged over the centuries, being the site of countless battles. The Hollowing and its consequences, not just the death toll but also the emigration which it spurred, have done further damage to a region that was always one of Germany’s least prosperous owing to the poor quality of its soil. Even the coastal cities, the sole beacons of wealth in the area, have suffered due to the ever-growing Atlantic trade. It will take more than just an aggressive expansion and modernization of regional industries, farms, and infrastructure to bring prosperity : we must focus on growing the Elbian German middle class, which for too long has been stifled by the Junkers (nobility) and the merchant elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
alleviate_the_hollowing_title;Alleviate the Hollowing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,;;x,,,,,,,,
alleviate_the_hollowing_desc;The Hollowing has wreaked incalculable damage across Germany - yet modern science allows us to heal these wounds. Introducing new methods of farming and transportation, along with distributing grain and bread to affected communities, will help not only reduce starvation now but prevent it in the future. Export controls will be imposed to forbid merchants from selling foodstuffs abroad during times of extreme hardship, and laws against price gouging shall be enforced to drive the cost of food back down to a fair level. New housing shall be constructed to accommodate the vast population movements which occurred as a result of the crisis, workhouses constructed to allow the poor to earn a living wage, and factories given tax breaks in exchange for hiring workers who had been forced into itinerancy. Slowly but surely, the scars across the Elbe shall fade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
promote_nordism_title;Promote Nordicism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
promote_nordism_desc;Nordicism is a cultural movement which is the successor to the Gothicism movement of the 17th and 18th centuries. It sees Scandinavia, the German-ruled Baltics, and northern Germany as belonging to the same social continuum, joined by their Protestant faith and the Baltic Sea trade. Moreover it emphasizes a romanticist view of their common origins in the Gothic people, supporting the Gothicists’ belief that the Goths - and thus all Germanics - originated within Scandinavia, specifically in Sweden. Nordicism as an artistic style, a subset of romanticism, focused on reviving Old Norse motifs, while in Scandinavian architecture, it led to special designs in wood inspired by stave churches. Above all was the notion - aggressively fostered by the Scandinavian government - that the political future of the Elbians laid with the north, not the Catholics of the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
purge_junkers_title;Purge the Junkers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
purge_junkers_desc;With northern Germany experiencing a cultural and economic revival, the Junkers have become weaker than ever before. The growth of both coastal and inland communities has imperiled their dominance, and new political winds are guiding the population towards the glorious Nordic brotherhood rather than an imaginary pan-German ideal. Many Junker estates are no longer profitable and so the time has come to force them to sell off their lands to the state to cover their debts, whereupon we shall distribute them to independent farmers. Those who resist shall have their lands confiscated. This act shall finally break the manorial stranglehold upon northern Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SPC_form_commonwealth_desc;The Colombian Wars were a series of bloodbaths that had lasted over twenty one years. Through what now seems like a complete miracle- Spain had prevailed and restored order over Colombia. However- there are already whispers of a potential second set of independence wars and unless we were to reorganize our territory in a way that treat the Colombian people as equals to our Iberian population, it is unlikely that we will be able to hold on to this territory any further then the turn of the next century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_upper_granada_title;Partition the Granadan Viceroyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_upper_granada_desc;The Viceroyality of Granada has remained by far the most loyal of the four Viceroyalities of Colombia. However, contained inside this Viceroyalty is a region that is known to be completely disloyal to the Hispanic crown and would rather tie themselves to the Incan Empire or outright revolt for independence: Quito. Therefore it should be the immediate imperative of the Hispanic crown to therefore abolish the Viceroyalty of Granada, annex the loyalist regions in the north and establish a new Viceroyalty of Quito which should maintain our interests in the area without catastrophic instability issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPC_annex_VMEX_desc;The Viceroyalty of Mexico was not a creation of the Hispanic crown. It is a abomination that effectively obliterated the concept of New Spain and replaced it with a entire cultural identity that had diverged even further from Spain then regions like Granada or Central America. New schools of Economic and Political thought have enabled us to craft a "valid" claim that the unique identity of the Mexican culture is barely apparent or even non-existent compared to Central Spanish and with these claims we should be easily able achieve full acceptance of this culture inside of a few months and the annexation of the Viceroyalty alongside it- ending the legacy of Gran Colombia once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VLST_title;End the Other Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VLST_desc;The Viceroyalty of Lusitania might as well be ruling over a completely foreign culture in comparison to the rest of Colombia because Lusitania has continued to be the bastion of so-called "Pure Portuguese" speakers who refuse to even try to align their language with the rest of Colombia. As the world continues to get smaller due to continued technological advance in naval construction and ideologies such as "Pan-Hispanism" reach their inevitable climax- we cannot tolerate this sort of behaviour any further and must strive to align their culture with the mainlander Portuguese rather then the wild divergence that they presently are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VQUI_title;The Final Obstacle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPC_annex_VQUI_desc;The Viceroyalty of Quito was set up after the partition of Granada. It was created due to a general inability to maintain control over that region due to mostly being populated by Native Amerigans and mountainous terrain that heavily limited infrastructure projects. With the turn of a new century, annexation and integration of the north and completion of infrastructure projects such as the Andagoya Canal- there is no further need to maintain the final obstacle to our supremacy over Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW22.D;The King of Spain, his cabinet and the countless viceroys, governors and landholders that make up the ruling class of the various Colombian Viceroyalties have met in Havana to discuss the creation of a unified Hispanic Commonwealth. Spain, being in a undeniably advantageous position at this Congress was able to make them agree with the creation of such a union but it was a impossibility to make the Viceroys and the ruling class of these Viceroyalities agree with everything. Concessions would still have to be made and these include the inability for the Commonwealth to integrate Catalonia at any point, the capital would be moved to Lisbon and guarantees that the Viceroyalities would maintain complete autonomy for the time being ( with the exception of the Captaincy-General of Cuba and the isthmus of Andagoya).

This has resulted in the creation of several political groups that demand for either immediate liberalization or independence from the Empire. This unrest has finally come to a head, as both independence and liberalization groups finally deciding to reconcile and ally with the sole intention of either forcing the liberalization of the Hispanic Empire or ensuring its immediate dissolution. The ultimatum has already been sent to the King and they now await a response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.A;We are forced to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW24.B;The King shall not have his power decreased to irrelevance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.T;The Hispanic Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.D;The Hispanic Commonwealth has suffered from countless setbacks, to the point where a power which could have once been called one of the greatest in the world has declined to a point of near irrelevance on the world stage. There are already rumours of a plot to separate Colombia from Spain in the desperate hope that without the dead-weight that is Spain then Colombia could rise to greatness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW25.A;Everything is fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.T;The Second Congress of Havana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.D;Various important political figures from all Colombian states had met in Havana to consider the creation of a new "Colombian Alliance" to deliberately fight back against Iberian influence in Colombia. This council had lasted for no more then a week before they had all unanimously agreed on the creation of such a alliance, and they had even agreed on the second proposal of creating a federal union between all these states. It seems that the creation of a Hispanic Commonwealth had the unintended effect of unifying regions that previously had been deliberately in-fighting between each other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW26.A;That's treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.T;The Second Colombian Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.D;The second most important question put forwards at the Second Congress of Havana was what type of government this new "unified Colombia" would have. This would take the form of a federal democratic republic as imagined by Herrera, Vincente and the other glorious figures of the First Colombian Independence War, as any other alternatives would be unacceptable in the current political climate. With the inauguration of the first President of the Federal Republic of Colombia- a demand would be sent regarding the immediate withdrawal of Spain from Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW27.A;Why resurrect the legacy of Herrera?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.T;The Illegal Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.D;The second most important question put forwards at the Second Congress of Havana was what type of government this new "unified Colombia" would have. This would have been a republic if not for the attendance of Pedro, Duke of Coimbra whom had spoken up regarding his affinity towards the plight of the Colombian people, and the legitimacy that could be gained if Colombia had a Emperor. The congress agreed and Pedro was therefore crowned Pedro I, Emperor of the Colombian Empire and protector of the Colombian people. His first proclamation with the support of the congress would be to immediately declare independence from Spain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW28.A;Disavow that maniac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.T;The Second Colombian Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.D;The dream of $COUNTRY$ would be born at the Congress of Havana after Spain's successful suppression of the First Colombian Independence War and it would continue to reign supreme as the hegemon of the New World for many years. However, $COUNTRY$ has failed to maintain this prestigious position and has undergone a rapid decline that would ultimately result in a Second Congress of Havana- a congress that would resurrect the legacy of the original Colombian Alliance and declare independence for all Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW29.A;Thus we return to madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW30.T;The Hispanic Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW30.D;$COUNTRY$ has prevailed against the forces that had intended for its destruction. The various political figures that were responsible for this Independence War have been charged with treason and removed from their positions, replaced by far more loyal individuals whom shall maintain the security and stability of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW31.T;The Death of Hispania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW32.T;La Nación Dividida;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW32.D;Spain has known war for decades in 1836. Following the coup of 1808 and the proclamation of a Constitutional Monarchy under the usurper Jose II, Pedro IV rallied his supporters during the Brothers’ War that saw the Peninsula ravaged by war as Liberals battled the Legitimists helped by the Dual-Monarchy. Jose II was eventually vanquished in 1815, sent in exile abroad while Pedro IV regained his throne. Portugal who had been the main base of support of the Liberals, still entertains the legacy of Jose II, with more Liberal plotters in Lisbon and Oporto than in the rest of the country, with many still angered at the relocation of the capital away from Lisbon to Madrid. Nevertheless, the Colombian War has managed to reunite all the Peninsulares against the end of colonial order in the New-World. But after that, who knows what will happen to Spain ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW32.A;One King, one nation !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW33.T;Death of Jose de Aviz-Lorraine ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW33.D;Our ambassador in Roma has informed us of the death of the former usurper Jose. Brought to power by a seditious assembly in 1808, he and his partisans were eventually vanquished by the rightful King Pedro IV in 1815 with the help of the Dual-Monarchy. Jose was allowed by his brother to settle with a small court in Roma, far from his country. A Liberal inspired by Enlightenment philosophers, his short reign saw the first promulgated Constitution in Europe, while his exile marked the beginning of the Colombian Wars as the colonies refused the return to status quo. With no heir to survive him, Alfonso XV does not have a dynastic opposition to his own rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW33.A;And a nuisance less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW34.T;Death of Jose II;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW34.D;The news of the death of the rightful King of Spain in exile, Jose II has come to the New-World, with a day of mourning declared by the Republic. A reformer brought to power against his brother by the Porto Junta of 1808, Jose’s reign had been cut by the Dual-Monarchy who supported the reactionary Pedro IV. After his defeat, many in the colonies rebelled against the return of Pedro and Absolutism. An embassy sent by Herrera had proposed him the Crown of Gran Colombia but the King refused, having relinquished any claims with his defeat. " ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW34.A;Goodbye our King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW35.D;The counter-attack that followed the miracle of Havana and saw the Royal Army get back some ports through loyalists in Andagoya and Lusitania helped secure funds and troops from Spain. But as the news of our losses come back to Europe, banks and our own officials begin to worry about our winning possibilities. The war must end quick lest the unrest at home gets too strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW01.T;The Two Capitals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW01.D;Ever since the creation of Spain in the 16th Century, there has been a constant debate regarding which capital the Kingdom should be ruled from. For a short period at the beginning of the 19th Century, the capital was moved to Lisbon for the very first time under the initiative of Jose "the Reformer". However, his successor Pedro IV would opt to move the capital back to Madrid as the Viceroyalities started to collapse into rebellion. Now as the fires of rebellion have finally died down in Colombia either though our ultimate victory or defeat, Alfonso XV has finally decided to put a end to this debate and choose the true capital of Spain once and for all. The institutions of Spain shall be forever be tied to this permanent capital and it shall be never moved again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW01.A;Stay in Madrid ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW02.T;The Spanish Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW02.D;$COUNTRY$ has suffered endless setbacks in foreign policy, economic decision making and military mobilization. The result is that Spain, once one of the greatest nations in the world: has been completely crippled. Countless citizens have taken to the streets to protest our persevered weakness and there are already talks of succession or revolution by independence movements or military cliques. It is only a matter of time before a match is struck and $COUNTRY$ burns to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW02.A;This is only a temporary crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.T;The Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.D;The crisis has hit a new level today as the King has dissolved parliament and taken effective control over the entire apparatus of state with the justification being of emergency circumstances. However, this did not go down well with the population of $COUNTRY$ who have seen fit to permanently cut off communication with the central government and leave the situation in a stand off between the government and these various movements. The fire is beginning to burn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.A;The King is always right;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.T;The Federal Review;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.D;The Lisbon-ruled Spanish Federation has found itself confused by various reports that state that various city governments in Castille are simply refusing to pay tax with the reason that the federation does not have any right to rule over Castille as the union of crowns that permitted such a aberration has been deposed. A review board has been created and a census is under way to find out exactly causing grief with these local governments beyond that of simple monarchist ties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.A;The monarchy is dead. They need to get over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.T;The Review Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.D;The Spanish Federation is unable to formulate any policy that could solve these innate issues with the population because as it turns out a clique of military officers have already taken the initiative and have seized Madrid. They are now claiming to be the legitimate government of Spain but have taken no moves to ignite a civil war in the hopes that we will stand down and let them take over the country. This is a stand off. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.A;This is madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.T;Military Movements in Madrid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.D;One of our most esteemed Generals, one "General Zavala" has seen fit to relocate a large portion of veterans of the Guardia Real to Madrid. Zavala has continued to claim that our republican revolution was a Portuguese conspiracy and that they always felt that the monarchy should be abolished and the capital moved to Lisbon after the betrayal of Alfonso XV in his choice to keep the capital in Madrid. It is likely that he is of very little threat to us because if he attempts to coup the government, the citizens will just counter him with force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.A;A minor threat. Easily resolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW06.T;Zavala's Coup d'etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW06.D;What the government of Spain was somewhat expecting has finally occurred: General Zavala has assumed the apparatus of government in Madrid today by force of arms. The parliament has been dissolved and Zavala is already claiming that the Portuguese traitors shall be dealt with and anyone supporting the ideas of democracy will be suppressed. Naturally, in Portugal and Galicia this has been taken as a insult but the greatest threat lies in the monarchist circles in Castille whom were expecting a immediate restoration after the coup but were denied as Zavala would prefer to remain president-for-life. For a moment, Spain is quiet. However, this stand off cannot last forever. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW08.T;Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW08.D;Ever since the end of the Colonial Wars, a rift has been growing in Spain between Lisbon and Madrid after Alfonso XV had decided to place the capital of Spain in Lisbon. Today, the tensions have boiled over as Madrid has been occupied by a military junta that states that it intends to restore stability to Spain and the legitimate government in Lisbon has responded with a declaration of war which has immediately torn the country to pieces. Whomever survives this war will dictate the fate of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW10.T;The Kingdom of Castille;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW10.D;The nightmare that everyone had expected has finally occurred. A individual claiming to be a member of the long lost original House of Aviz has persuaded a good portion of Castille to break off and declare independence with the expectation of creating a democratic Kingdom of Castille. Only in the chaos of a civil war could have anyone expected such a situation to occur but the seeds were planted back when the capital had been chosen and a good portion of the Castillian population had decided that independence would be preferable to being ruled by Portugal. This threat must be defeated or it will be the death of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW11.T;Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW11.D;Ever since the end of the Colonial Wars, a rift has been growing in Spain between Lisbon and Madrid after Alfonso XV had decided to keep the capital of Spain in Madrid. Today, the tensions have boiled over as the Government of Madrid has declared war on all forces that intend to destabilize Spain. The result? A reborn Kingdom of Castille has been created by what is said to be a member of the long lost original House of Aviz that intends to restore democracy to a independent Castille. Whomever survives this war will dictate the fate of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW19.D;We are now on our quest to restore what is rightfully the realm of the Legitimate Government of Spain. However, first we must choose what form of government we will be rallying behind.

SPACW15.T;Victory of the Legitimate Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW15.D;We have defeated the Junta and ensured that they will rule no longer over Spain. However, the Kingdom of Castille has declared that they will not reunite with us and reform Spain and rather maintain their separation from us. We could respond to this by either tolerating their existence and ceding all territory we own that is rightfully theirs back to them or alternatively declaring them and the Galician traitors as illegitimate successions from the legitimate government of Spain and conquer them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to note that the relative weakness of this state in comparison to European states upon its formation should make it exceptionally easy to conquer and add to our colonial empire, but if $COUNTRY$ were to leave this any longer then Zanzibar could easily build a military to a European standards and make any conquest attempt exceptionally difficult. So, does $COUNTRY$ invade Zanzibar and add it to its colonial empire or attempt a more diplomatic approach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DUA70.D;With the Anglois Question now out into the open and slowly tearing the country to pieces, Henri X has deemed it necessary that the Estates-General must be dissolved at once to ensure future stablity of the state. There are many questions to why he would do such a thing but it is likely that though his experiences of the German Revolution and various other events in recent years, he has come to believe that democracy in any regard is a destabilizing force and no state can survive without it being regulated or even abolished. However, many in the Dual Monarchy (especially in England) feel that his experiences should rather reaffirm the Estates-General and not be cause to dismantle it. Regardless of the outcome it is likely that his event shall affect the coming importance of the Anglois Question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DUA71.D;Dissolving the Estates-General was going to have consequences and so Paris is in complete revolt. The King of the Dual-Monarchy has been presented with two possible ways to resolve this situation, he can either give in and restore the Estates-General to what is was before the Counter-Revolution or alternatively he can use the few remaining military assets scattered outside of Paris to attack and destroy the revolt. However due to the saturation of this revolt and the fact that these military assets are mostly left over artillery from the German Revolution, it is likely that this will be considered a not very prestigious act and ultimately one of sheer desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nobody knows how long that this could be maintained for but it is likely that the liberals may return in time to stop this counter-revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme_anglois_language_schooling_title;Fascist Anglois Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;
extreme_anglois_language_schooling_desc;Education is becoming a rather central subject in Anglois politics. The empire is in favour of standardizing education, making it free and open to all children, to make them future catholic and anglois citizens. All other languages will be banned and the Anglois language will become the only legal language in the Western Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA175.T;The Great Gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA175.D;As the tide of liberal revolution burns throughout Europe, it has rendered the Dual Monarchy in an extremely unstable position and the Anglois Question is likely to be the doom of us unless we promptly crack down heavily on one of the groups that are leading this revolt against the Anglois Nation. Two potential options have been presented to the Estates-General regarding resolving the current crisis, one that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Anglican English and another that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Protestant Occitan. Whomever we target is likely to be secured without much of a issue but the other group is likely to react against this decision to such a degree that our ability to control the region will be sacrificed, for now. Of course we could refuse to enact either option and sacrifice nothing but the Anglois question will continue to destabilize our nation and make the general integration of our non-Anglois population an extremely difficult endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
DUA176.T;Third Aquitaine Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA176.D;The Dual Monarchy has declared the Occitan Language a destabilizing influence and has banned the language from all educational institutions. Unsurprisingly, this has been met with a uproar from Occitania which has found themselves under endless oppression since the liberal revolutions of the 1840s. A group known as the Sons of Saint Louis have declared what is now called "The Third Aquitaine Revolt" as they illegally seize a large portion of Occitania to "protect themselves from the Anglois menace who seek to destroy their culture". Unfortunately for them, this revolt has little or no international recognition and it is unlikely that it will seen as anything more then a minor police action by the great powers of Europe. These are the dying days of the Occitan Culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA178.T;Succession of Provence and Toulouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA178.D;In a set of democratic referendums that were performed immediately after the downfall of the Dual Monarchy, the regions of both Provence and Toulouse have declared unilateral independence from the United Republic. They say that this was a result of the former policies of the Dual Monarchy that had deliberately targeted and oppressed the English Population and left the Occitan regions feeling as if they would be the next to have their cultures effectively destroyed and forcefully integrated into the Anglois Culture. This had left the regions in a state of effective anarchy with minimal control being felt from Paris and many independence groups popping up that would deliberately target any attempts for the Anglois Culture to spread to these regions. The great powers have already recognized these states and any attempt to annex them now would be seen to be a highly aggressive action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They say that this was a result of the former policies of the Dual Monarchy that had deliberately targeted and oppressed the Occitan Population and left the English regions feeling as if they would be the next to have their cultures effectively destroyed and forcefully integrated into the Anglois Culture.

DUA180.T;A Federal Government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA180.D;In a shocking turn of events, the schooling reforms that were proposed by the Estates-General were not just rejected but practically thrown out by every single level of the government. Instead, a new piece of legislation is being passed around that outright rejects any attempt to destroy any cultural group in $COUNTRY$ and rather reform the entire entity into a federal state which moves away from the concept of Anglois domination and enacts heavy rules and regulations to outright prevent any form of assimilation and guarantee the rights of every single cultural group in the $COUNTRY$. The absolute majority of the government is ready to pass this legislation but there is still a exceptionally small minority that is willing to support the schooling reforms, the head of state could easily intervene to support their position with the point that attempting to create such a state entirely goes against the point of the $COUNTRY$. What will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA181.T;The Dangers of a Federal Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA181.D;$COUNTRY$ may have enacted the bill that has formed the Federal Government, but many are still wary at the idea of federalism. They fear that if the Dual Monarchy were to decline to a lesser position on the world stage (GP6 or below), or have its capital occupied. Then the very protections which ensured the rights of the various cultural groups could backfire and result in the complete collapse of the Dual Monarchy. Be vigilant, be aware.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA182.T;The Occitan Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA182.D;$COUNTRY$ had taken the risky step to implement a system of cultural autonomy that may have given too many rights to its varied cultural groups. This system would have proven sufficient so long as the Dual Monarchy maintained its status as the one of the greatest powers on the planet, however continued failures by the government of $COUNTRY$ has resulted in a situation where this system has backfired and the "State of Occitania" has declared unilateral independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA183.T;The Federal Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA183.D;$COUNTRY$ has entered a state of total collapse as the system that had protected it against cultural unrest has utterly backfired upon the moment that a group was refused independence. Every single important minority group has now declared unilateral independence and the Dual Monarchy now burns in totality.;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, they were unable to break the spirit of the English and when the Anglois decided to attempt to conscript the English into a Global War- conscription riots quickly spiralled out of control into a full blown uprising and the newly formed Republic of England overwhelmed all Anglois garrisons across England before sending a ultimatum. Withdraw or suffer the wraith of chaotic rebellion that would completely destroy the Anglois State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA185.T;The Uprising Escalates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA185.D;The Ultimatium was refused, and the English immediately started their efforts of deliberately inciting revolts throughout the whole of the British Isles. It would be only a short few days until the Republic of Wales and the Republic of Ireland would be declared and they would immediately join the uprising along with the English. At this point it is abundantly clear that the Anglois will have to fight most of the British Isles if they have any hopes of regaining control over the territory again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That mission, conducted with firm resolve and utmost diligence, is now bearing fruit at last. Civilization is finally spreading beyond its bastions of Paris, Londres, and the lands surrounding them. Là où l'on entendait autrefois les langues répugnantes et discordantes des paysans anglais et français, nous ne sommes plus accueillis que par les notes mélodieuses de notre langue nationale. Jamais plus notre peuple ne sera molesté par la déplorable sauvagerie qui infestait autrefois notre société. Du mur d'Hadrien à la Riviera, il n'y aura qu'une seule nation.

anglois_education_system_desc;For hundred's of years, the Dual Monarchy has lacked a singular, centralized curriculum that has led to each university simply providing their own, leading to a varied, dysfunctional state of low efficiency. Jean-Pascal Toutain, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University of 1752-1760, had attempted to bring order to this chaotic system, as well as open up new avenues for education in England, using his wealth to fund and endow voluntary schools across England. Gathering his peers to establish a singular curriculum. His arguments espousing from towards greater efficiency, an professional & educated workforce, as well as maintaining linguistic control of the curriculum to give French it's primary position in the English Curriculum.

However, the system that is being implemented by the Education Minister is that of the abolition of local dialects in schools and to teach the Anglois curriculum universally. There have already been strong debates in the Estates-General regarding this decision as many are calling it "verifiable insanity" and many arguments regarding the fact that the Anglois state should move away from a system of cultural oppression as dictated by the Plantagenets and into either a Federal System or alternatively just have referendums to see what regions wish to stay with the Anglois State.;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUAF1.D;It was shortly after noon today when the Royal Court Orchestra participated in the Viel-Castel Festival in Angoulême, the birth- and deathplace of the Anglois composer Baron Auguste de Viel-Castel. His twelve symphonies, various individual pieces of military marches, and an unfinished opera have been praised by laymen and professionals alike and are credited to have fully established the role of the Binioù Cantorbérien, a special bagpipe which stands at the end of a centuries-spanning evolution of this instrument within the Dual Monarchy, combining various pipe traditions from Brittany and Ireland. The festival has brought this instrument into public focus for its pleasant sound and versatile functionality. Indeed, Edouard Pichon, a contemporary composer from Londres, enthusiastically reacted: "Every generation gets a chance to change the world of music : he [Viel-Castel] realized it for us. For a nation without melody is a nation without soul, and our nation's soul is one of vitality, carried by the purity and humbleness of this instrument of ours, the Binioù...";;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA1.D;The sudden emancipation of England from the Plantagenet yoke has left us in the lurch. With the House of Godwin having long since died out, we must turn to other houses. The first option would be the House of Cassel-Bourgogne, a cadet of the Burgundians. The Burgundians are staunch Protestants, and their friendship would be valuable, but such close bonds to a Great Power may be unwise. The second option would be a neutral German house, with the obvious exception of the Catholic Jagiellons. This is the safest choice, yet it would win us little in terms of strong allies. The third option is the House of Cavendish, in Beornia. Despite the insistence of most historians, the Cavendish family claim to be the last descendants of the Godwins and thus the rightful heirs of England.

Just as our Savior declared that none place their lamps beneath bowls, so we shall not darken the light of civilization in deference to barbarism.”\n\nThe French-speaking elite of the south have rallied against English nationalism.

The French-speaking upper and middle class of southern England is our foundation, and the English-speaking north is being watched carefully, with the Welsh in the west acting as a counterweight. As always, we are promoting unity based on shared allegiance to the Crown and faith in the Catholic Church. So long as this arrangement holds, we should be able to keep things humming along in Londres. If cracks start to show, however, then this refuge may not be so safe after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA3.A;The weather here is dreadful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA4.T;A People Adrift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA4.D;The loss of France has left our republic in a precarious situation. Having retreated to the north, we find ourselves awash in a sea of English and Welsh citizens whose feelings towards the government are on the wane. The House of Plantagenet spent generations building up the French-speaking upper and middle class in the south and throwing enough bones to the Welsh in the west, to keep the English in the north from getting too rowdy. It was the crown, and the Catholic Church, which bound Plantagenet England together. Now, the dawn of republican rule and our severance from France has thrown all of that into doubt. Hard questions are being asked by almost everyone of influence within the nation about what sort of identity we are to adopt going forwards – questions with no easy or simple answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA4.A;Londres feels colder than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA5.T;The Opening of the Estates-General in Londres;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA5.D;The maintenance of regular governance requires that the legislature proceed smoothly. Thus the Estates-General was convened in Londres, gathering the major representatives of the lords and the common people of the nation to ensure no interruption in government business. At least, that was the plan. It turned out that quite a few English nationalists arrived to disrupt proceedings, declaring the assembly illegitimate and an “instrument of foreign conquerors” or some such drivel. While the authorities assure us that the situation is under control, a few hungry-eyed generals have remarked that if the crowd were to be, say, allowed to roam a bit too far outside the bounds of safety, we would have no choice but to declare martial law, dissolve the Estates General, and implement rule by decree. This would no doubt make the English even more upset but at least we would not have to humor their prattle anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA5.A;Unfortunately, good governance cannot take holidays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA5.B;Don’t mind us opening up this barricade when no one is around…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA6.T;The English Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA6.D;The issue of English nationalism can no longer be ignored. Northerners demand that government business and private commerce be allowed to be conducted in English, while southerners insist that French must rule supreme. If we are to continue our rule on the island, then we must come to terms with its demography. How this will all play out depends largely on the political situation which was established in England prior to our loss of France. If we had spent time cultivating the loyalty of the English elite and middle class, then we would likely be able to prevent chaos, though we would still have to settle the language dispute. If on the other hand we had favored the French speakers, whether alone or as part of the Anglois ideal, then we may be in for a rough go of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA6.A;Why is this island so uncivilized?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA7.T;The Anglois Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA7.D;The issue of the French within our nation can no longer be ignored. Southerners demand that government business and private commerce be allowed to be conducted in French, while northerners insist that English must rule supreme. If we are to prevent the collapse of our nation, then we must come to terms with its demography. Bringing both peoples together is the most noble option but it is also the one most likely to cause critics of the regime to fixate upon their differences and tear our nation apart – the same problem faced by the Plantagenets and their Anglois project. We may be in for a rough go of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA7.A;The Norman ghost looms large over England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA8.T;The Fruits of our Labors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA8.D;Our efforts to garner the support of the English upper and middle class for the Crown have paid off. Administration officials have received reassurance from nobles and industrialists across the island that they shall not abandon the government. Moreover, English nationalist groups appear to be fraying at the seams, as their more moderate elements realize that they have more to gain by working within the system. On the one hand, it is a relief to see tensions dropping across the island, especially in the north. On the other hand, the support of English culture by the government does not mean the resolution of our national identity. A decision will still have to be made about our destiny but the likelihood of our survival has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA8.A;The English are very fine people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA9.T;A Question of Crowns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA9.D;If our nation is to survive upon the world stage then we must determine its identity. Diplomat after diplomat has referred to our nation as “Britannia” and “England” interchangeably, to the distress of French- and English-speakers alike. It seems logical that we officially declare our sovereign to be the King of Brittanie, to show our continued support for the French of the island who have long been our foundation. But a radical group of ministers have made a shocking proposal : crown him king not merely IN England, but OF England. We were English for three hundred years, they reason, and if France is lost then we ought to truly embrace our subjects. This would be a shocking pivot of policy but it does have its attractions…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA11.T;The Restoration of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA11.D;After centuries of disappearance from the maps of Europe, the nation of England once more emerges into the world. We have undergone many changes in the last few centuries, most of all the French-speaking south, but the essence of our people – the stalwart rural communities, the industrious cities, and the pride and dignity inherent in all the sons and daughters of England – has endured. Now, we greet a new century, full of hopes and possibilities. The risks to our island are great, but our determination to overcome them is greater still.\n\nWe shall not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall our Sword sleep in hand…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA11.A;Till we have built Jerusalem in England’s green and pleasant land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA12.T;L’Apostasie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA12.D;”NOUS NE SOMMES PAS ANGLAIS! NOUS NE SOMMES PAS ANGLAIS!”\n\nViolent protests have broken out across southern England, as French speakers of all classes express their outrage at the Anglois Crown’s Anglicization. The upper class is disgusted at the sovereign’s abandonment of his French heritage : the middle class is infuriated at the government’s disavowal of the Anglois population : and the lower class abhors the notion of becoming subjects of the “damnable northern Protestant apes,” as one Londres dockworker put it. Francophones throughout the south are losing faith in the monarchy, to say nothing of their loathing of the English nation. Anglois intellectuals are now pivoting to a new concept, rooted in Roman and Norman revivalism : the dream of Britannia, a state of their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA12.A;They want French? How about “Dieu et mon droit!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA13.T;The Anglois Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA13.D;Agitation amongst the Anglois continues to burn, with no end in sight. The violent clashes of the recent past have died down, but the crisis is still nowhere near resolved. Everyone, from the lowliest laborers to the richest elites, are growing tired of Anglois-English tensions turning even the most minor disputes into possible conflagrations. The generous option would be to increase funding for English language education programs in the south and reduce the usage of Anglois in local government business. Of course, we could also adopt a policy of aggressively encouraging Anglois emigration to France. Both of these solutions are unlikely to be miracle cures, but they would be better than doing nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA13.A;Integration is the only humane policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA13.B;If they want to speak French, then they should go back to France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA14.T;Social Deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA14.D;Order is beginning to fracture across $COUNTRY$. The tensions between the English and the Anglois are still running at a fever pitch and all our efforts to resolve the matter have, if anything, made things worse. What was once an issue of social stability, and the rule of law, is now a question of whether the nation will be able to keep itself together. To that end, a conference of leading English and Anglois politicians has been called to attempt to work out a framework in which the north and south can resolve their differences without bloodshed. For the sake of neutrality, the conference shall be held in Cardiff, the capital of Wales. Reactionaries murmur that this will give the Welsh bargaining power of their own but at this point we are far more concerned with averting disjunction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA14.A;The fate of the isle will be decided in CARDIFF? Good God…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA15.T;The Cardiff Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA15.D;From the outset, the meeting of English, Anglois, and Welsh delegates in Cardiff was tense. None of the delegates trusted the other teams to act in good faith, and suspicion carried the day. After discarding the possibility of a unitary state under either English or Anglois authority, a federal republic, or even a federation, it seems that the only deal with any level of bipartisan support is a plan brought forth by the Welsh. They advocate for establishing an “English Confederation” in which England, Wales, and Britannia would be component states of a single nation. All three would be internally sovereign, with their own legal codes and language statues, but England would lead the way in foreign policy. When the Welsh delegates read out this proposition, all eyes fell upon Alfred Percival, the head of the English delegation, for his reaction – many felt that if this proposal fell through, war would be the only other option. The first sentence he uttered was…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA15.A;“How DARE you!” §R(CIVIL WAR INEVITABLE)§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA15.B;“This proposal, while flawed, has merits.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA16.T;The Birth of the English Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA16.D;As per the terms of the Cardiff Agreement, England, Wales, and Britannia now form three parts of a single nation. Unfortunately, England’s dominant social position has allowed them to secure the right to lead foreign policy. While we shall be able to protect our own institutions and laws we must still render up our external sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA16.A;At least they won’t make us eat their dreadful so-called “food.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA17.T;A Small Error;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA17.D;Ever since our exile in England, we have been preparing to reconquer France and restore the full strength of our former empire. We have had to make said plans in secret, owing to the likely public outcry if said goals were discovered before being put into action. Sadly, it appears that someone talked. This morning newspapers across Londres ended all hope of secrecy. Article after article has purported to have the “real truth” about the plans to liberate France, and though many of them contradict each other, the sheer volume of information now flooding the populace has made it impossible to deny our intentions. The English are furious that we would plan to expend their resources and their sons in a war of “imperial vainglory,” and even some of the lower Anglois classes are disturbed that we are not more focused on internal development. Shall we press on regardless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA17.A;No, starting a war now could very well spark another one at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA17.B;Yes, France awaits us and the rabble don’t rule this nation yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA18.T;The Neufchâtel Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA18.D;“We live in a period in which the plight of our kindred people upon the Continent can no longer be ignored. The preceding years have seen Britannia, for reasons of appeasing the unenlightened multitudes, withhold the full breadth of its glory from illuminating the ancient land of our ancestors. This state of irresponsibility, prolonged by a class whose interests lie solely in their own aggrandizement at the public expense, has left the Continent awash in calamity. Therefore, there is no longer any reason, any possible excuse, for us to stay our righteous hands any longer. We must rescue our fraternal peoples to our south.”\n\nThe leader of the realm recently gave a speech in Neufchâtel, in which he declared our new mission to save the Anglois of northern France from the hordes at their gates. Our armed forces are already preparing the invasion. The English seem rather unenthused by this and rumors are swirling that they may be arming for a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA18.A;The English are nothing compared to our destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA19.T;La Deuxième Anarchie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA19.D;Our police forces had managed to learn of a series of secret meetings between Welsh and Anglois nationalists, and moved to arrest several notable politicians of both groups to head off a joint uprising. Unfortunately, violent resistance was encountered in multiple cases, and now some of the most famous firebrands in Wales and southern England are dead or dying. News of the calamity has, rather than decapitated the nationalists, galvanized them. Mass protests have broken out throughout the south and west, concentrated around Cardiff and Londres. Welsh and Anglois members of the military have begun to abandon their barracks, or even assist their cultural kin in raiding their own unit’s armories. Government officials are retreating northwards as urban areas throughout lower England become overrun by revolutionaries. Worst of all, rather than compete with the Anglois, the Welsh have pledged loyalty to them…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA19.A;Oh, dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA20.T;The Second Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA20.D;A recent demonstration in Amwythig by English and Welsh nationalists demanding an end to Anglois dominance was noted with concern by the authorities, who feared that it might grow violent. Police were dispatched to contain the demonstrators, but it seems as though things got rather heated. After being repeatedly provoked by the crowd, a cavalry unit decided to disperse them – with their sabers. In the ensuing chaos, over twelve people were killed and over five hundred were injured. The reaction from Wales and northern England was that of immediate outrage. Cities across the north and west have become rapidly overrun by violent protests, and English and Welsh soldiers have begun to desert – or even assist their ethnic kin in raiding their own unit’s armories. Government officials are retreating to Londres as urban areas throughout the upper half of the isle become overrun by revolutionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA20.A;Merde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA21.T;The English Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA21.D;The day of reckoning has arrived. All attempts to preserve the peace between the Anglois, the English, and the Welsh, have come to nothing. This morning both England and Britannia declared themselves to be the sole authority over the isle, and then rejected demands by each other to submit to their rule. Military units have fragmented along cultural lines, and the first skirmishes by local militias against their rivals have already begun. Not since the dark days of the Anarchy in the twelfth century has this land seen the type of chaos, bloodshed, and discord which it now finds itself imbrued within. Whichever power prevails in the fratricidal struggle to come shall make their indelible mark upon the soul of the isle – to the eternal detriment of the vanquished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA21.A;Princes are bound to give account of their Actions only to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA22.T;Britannia Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA22.D;Once again, the true Anglois stewards of civilization have cast down the barbarous hordes which threatened us! As our forefathers did in the time of William the Conqueror, so now we assume the burden of bringing modern culture and governance to all Britannia. The clear lesson in all of this is that the English cannot be trusted to govern themselves. Henceforth we shall never allow them to slip from our rightful grasp again. Naturally, this will require…reductions amongst the most restive centers of the English savages, but that is a small price to pay for a safe nation. And of course, the Welsh question will have to be answered as well, in time. Nevertheless, we should celebrate this day – the dawn of a truly free Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA22.A;La victoire est à nous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA24.T;Everlasting England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA24.D;The true English have prevailed! The French hordes have been crushed and their armies have been swept from the field. For the first time since 1066, England is now a free nation. With our lands reunited, now comes the time to correct the errors of the last few centuries. From this moment onwards, the existence of a French culture in England will be illegal. Nobody will speak French in any public place. No documents, signs, or other instruments will use French. The Catholic Church shall be disestablished and Catholic monasteries across southern England dissolved. French will never be taught in any educational capacity and teachers will be mandated to employ corporal punishment against any student caught using it. Soon enough, the stain of eight hundred years shall be washed away, and its vile language with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA24.A;Leaving only a green and pleasant England in its wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA25.T;Domesday;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA25.D;England, Britannia, whatever one chooses to call it, has been undone. North and south remain unbroken, bloodied as they are, and exhaustion has taken hold across the isle. What has resulted is not peace, but merely the absence of direct war. The embittered participants now turn to exacting reprisals upon the minorities within their grasp, in the vain hope of washing out the bitter taste of failure. The only people to unquestionably profit from this situation are the Welsh, who now find themselves truly independent at last. The dream of Alfred of Wessex has perished at the hands of the Plantagenets’ legacy – a legacy of strife, division, and hatred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA25.A;We are better off alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA26.T;Decline of the Ligue du Midi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA26.D;Ever since the growth of Protestantism among Provençals in the sixteenth century, the feudal organization of allied southern communities known as the Ligue du Midi has championed the Huguenot (French Protestant) cause. Its power has declined from its height as a virtual rival government in prior centuries, but it has nevertheless remained the dominant force in the region. That power, however, is now on the wane. The death of Pierre de Bourbon, Comte d’Angoulême, has rendered extinct the Bourbon cadet branch from the West, which had joined their cousins who had led the Ligue for generations. Now is an excellent opportunity to seek to increase our control of Auvergne and further weaken the Ligue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA26.A;The fewer Protestants in our domain, the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA27.T;The Bourbon March;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA27.D;The Bourbons of Auvergne have long been the black sheep of their family, their Protestant beliefs marking them out as something of an embarrassment. The Occitans, however, have long held them in esteem as the only noble family courageous enough to defy both the Catholic Church and the Plantagenets. That does not mean that they all want to be ruled by them – yet now, the Duke of Bourbon has departed from his ancestral home with a retinue of soldiers. His aim is to strike at the capital of Occitania and claim it for himself! The duke has long styled himself an “Occitanophile,” adopting Occitan cultural aspects such as troubadour performance, and seeks to combine his family’s status as defenders of the Huguenots with his personal reputation to have himself crowned king. Both the republicans and the Valois of the east have dispatched columns to halt his advance…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA27.A;Long live the King of Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA29.T;The Waning of the Valois-Medici Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA29.D;For centuries, we have endured in Provence, keeping our claim to the French throne alive and attempting to regain it. However, in this era of new ideas regarding culture, language, and the importance of both to nationhood, our existence as a feudal remnant is now a liability. It is not enough to be the rulers of France by right : we must soon make it reality and connect our dynasty to the French people writ large. §RIf we have not recovered all of France by the time that nationalism blooms into full flower – likely to occur around 1850 – then our nation may collapse.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA29.A;France must and shall be ours again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA30.T;The End of the Valois-Medici Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA30.D;No dynasty or realm lasts forever, and ours has lasted far longer than most expected. Yet the growth of nationalist ideas phrased around language, culture, geography, and to an extent religion, have all combined to undermine the foundations of our rule. This morning local politicians in the western French-speaking parts of our domain gathered to proclaim their independence, bolstered by defecting soldiers and officers hailing from said regions. The sheer weight of popular support behind said separatists precludes any possibility of halting their efforts. The Valois-Medicis are “Kings in France” no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA33.D;“The Constitution guarantees as natural and civil rights : 1st, That all citizens are admissible to offices and employments, without other distinction than virtues and talents : 2nd, That all taxes shall be assessed equally upon all citizens, in proportion to their means : 3rd, That similar offenses shall be punished with similar penalties, without any distinction of persons…”\n\nThe end of the Plantagenet’s grip upon our nation has restored our freedom after nearly a millennium of subservience. Already, the leading political and legal minds of France have gathered in Paris to establish the constitutional basis for our newly free nation. While it has generally been agreed that the rights of the people must be safeguarded, the broader aspects of the constitution remain undetermined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA33.A;For the first time since Charles VII, France breathes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA34.T;The Question of the Head of State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA34.D;The most contentious aspect of the new French constitution has proven to be that of the executive. The mood amongst the delegates appears to be polarized between democratic advocates who argue for a democratically elected president, and those who believe that the revolutionary council should nominate a qualified leader as necessary. After nearly two weeks of debate without reaching an agreement, a small group of conservative representatives broached the possibility of establishing a new monarchy. The radical republicans heaped curses upon them, but the traditionalists argued that, since France has been a monarchy throughout its existence, and since the assembly seemed so bitterly divided between democrats and autocrats, a properly controlled and limited monarchy could rally the support of the people. Many liberals regard such an idea as political blasphemy, but it is an option nonetheless…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA35.T;The Valois-Medici Claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA35.D;With the Plantagenets cast out of France, the next most obvious claimant to the throne is the House of Valois-Medici in Provence. Known (or derided) as the “Kings in France” since the fourteenth century, the Valois-Medicis have remained an ambitious if small force in European politics. To their credit, they do hold a legitimate claim to the throne, and their house is quite venerable, while also boasting political connections in Italy. However, these same Italian connections are also a mark against them : the French elite scorn them as “Italians costumed as Frenchmen” and a bygone relic of a past age. Furthermore, they have begun to slip into the Provençal vernacular of their subjects – and most northern French regard the Provençals as ignorant and unruly Protestants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA35.A;The Gauls did not die for us to put an ITALIAN on the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA35.B;They are the legitimate claimants, even if they are half-Tuscan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA36.T;The Bourbon Claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA36.D;The third dynasty which holds a claim to the French throne is the House of Bourbon. The smallest of the Capetian cadet branches, the House of Bourbon has ruled in Navarre for hundreds of years. While not quite as “foreign” as the Valois-Medicis, the Bourbons are a relative footnote as far as dynastic fame is concerned and would not exactly gain us the respect of Europe – though it would do wonders for our Navarrese relations. There is also the matter of the “black sheep” of the Bourbons, the Auvergne Bourbons, whose Protestantism and nascent Occitan nationalism have brought the house no small amount of embarrassment. Still, if we do not want a Valois then they seem to be the only other legitimate option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA36.A;A Navarrese French Capetian is still a French Capetian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA36.B;This is ridiculous. We clearly need a republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA38.D;“For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.” – 1 Thessalonians 5 : 2\n\nThe news which graced our court seemed so fantastical that few could believe it. The new French government, having expelled the Plantagenets, had decided to establish a new monarchy – and now, they have asked US, the true kings of France, to take up the crown once again! The royal court was beside itself with joy at the news, and many of them are already preparing for the move to Paris. A few rumors drifted about that the king might reject an offer made by a revolutionary council, but, surely those are false – isn’t that right, Your Majesty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA39.T;The King of France Once More;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA39.D;While most of the king’s attendants traveled to Paris to get the royal family’s furnishings squared away, the king himself spent the preceding night at the Palace of Tau. This morning, after being properly dressed for the Sacre (coronation), he proceeded to the Reims Cathedral. There, in a solemn ceremony led by the Archbishop of Reims and the most powerful bishops, dukes, and counts of the realm, he partook in the ancient ritual by which he received both the oaths and the royal regalia from his clerical and noble subjects. The most important part of the ceremony was the anointing with the Chrism mixed with a drop from the Sainte Ampoule, the spiritual vesting of holy authority in the monarch. At the Sacre’s end, the Archbishop led the crowd in a joyous cheer which, to the utter shock of Europe at large, signaled the start of the new Valois era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA40.T;The Southern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA40.D;Ever since the Albigensian Crusade gutted most of the Provençal nobility and installed northern French lords in their stead, relations between France proper and “Occitania” have been less than pleasant. The spread of Protestantism across the region – echoing the growth of Catharism centuries before – further deepened the divide. Yet most French politicians, left or right, republican or monarchist, consider the notion of a separate “Occitan” nationality to be a fantasy, and insist that the region is merely the southern half of France. Unfortunately, the nation of Occitania is currently quite real, and we must determine how we shall recover it. There are several pan-French nationalists in Occitania who would be willing to petition for annexation if we helped them into power via revolutionary means. The alternative is to bet on the sentiments of pan-nationalism amongst the Provençals overcoming their nascent separatism, and petition for a referendum on annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA40.A;The will of the people shall make France whole once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA40.B;A referendum would be futile, we need more drastic measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA41.T;The Coup of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA41.D;While most of our government is composed of proud, Protestant Occitans, there are unfortunately quite a few Anglois and Catholics (and Anglois Catholics) amongst them, especially in western Aquitaine. We had brought them into the administration, even the military, in good faith, to demonstrate our willingness to embrace minorities. It seems that our trust was misplaced, and the northerners have shown their true colors. This morning we received word of pro-French militias engaging in battles with police and army units across Aquitaine. Shortly thereafter, a squad of Anglois mutineers attempted to storm the legislature! The local infantry division, which was drilling in the countryside today, was notified, and raced back into the city to thwart the traitors. Soon enough…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA41.A;The mutiny in both Aquitaine and the capital was utterly crushed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA41.B;The Anglois seized the assembly and asked for French annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA42.T;The South is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA42.D;After a band of heroic Anglois soldiers took control of the Provençal legislature, they did not hesitate to petition our government for annexation, an offer we graciously accepted. A simultaneous insurrection in Aquitaine gave our troops the chance to quickly storm into the south and sweep away the separatist government before they could mobilize the rest of their military. The lands which have so vexed Paris are now once more within our grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA42.A;And we shall never relinquish them again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA43.T;France Requests a Referendum on Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA43.D;The vile northerners who slaughtered our ancestors and stole our lands centuries ago never cease to prey upon us. This morning we received a notice from their government, in which they had the temerity to request that we hold a referendum on the annexation of Occitania into their nation! The very concept is absurd and insulting – nobody outside of Aquitaine proper would ever voluntarily return to the fold of the hated Catholic northerners. Denying their “request” – which is more accurately termed a demand – could spark war, but if we allow the referendum to be held anyway (if only to demonstrate their total lack of popularity), then there is a risk that they could use success amongst the Anglois of the Bordeaux area to push for the region’s annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA43.A;Hold the referendum to show them just how loathed they are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA43.B;Toss the note into the trash while the French diplomat is watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA44.T;An Issue with the Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA44.D;We had hoped that the Provençals would rally to the reunification of France, but it seems that this may not be the case. Polls conducted by major newspapers in the five largest cities of the south all show overwhelming opposition to annexation, with only the Anglois-dominated city of Bordeaux returning over 50% in favor. If we press ahead with the referendum, then it is likely that we will only receive a favorable response in the region of Aquitaine. Unless we want to settle for taking control of that region alone, we may want to cancel the referendum and avoid embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA44.A;Aquitaine is good enough for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA44.B;”Occitania” is not a real country! It all belongs to France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA45.T;Rethinking our Southern Strategy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA45.D;Our efforts to retake control of the south have come to naught. Whether by overt or covert means, no measure which we have yet employed has allowed us to reunify France and eliminate the separatist Provençal government. The next option which we could employ is to simply take control of the south by force, but this would win us no favors amongst the locals and could guarantee resistance for years to come. We may want to consider subtler means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA45.A;We crushed the south before and we’ll do it again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA45.B;We must take time to form a new plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA46.T;The Breton Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA46.D;Since the conquest of the Duchy of Brittany in 1492 by the King of France and England, and the exile of the last Duchess to Anvers where she lived her days as the consort of the King of Burgundy, the Burgundian Kings have held onto the title of Duke of Brittany. Now that Brittany has become independent once more, the Conservatives find themselves tempted to restore the heirs of Anne to their throne. Brittany stands divided between the French-speaking east and the Breton speakers of the west : Philippe, prince of Flanders, could serve as a national figure in our new state and help secure our independence thanks to his contacts in Anvers. However, Brittany is deeply Catholic, and he will only be able to take the Crown by abjuring his beliefs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA46.A;Send a representative to Anvers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA46.B;Brittany needs no sovereign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA47.T;A Messenger from Brittany;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA47.D;Since 1492 and the marriage of Anne of Brittany with John III of Burgundy, the Kings of Burgundy have been the rightful sovereigns of Brittany despite the Anglois conquest of the peninsula. At last, Brittany has arisen again, and the current government has sent a representative to Anvers to ask Philip, prince of Flanders, to become the new Duke of Brittany. While it would strengthen our relations with the new state, it comes with a price : Philip must abdicate his faith and become Catholic, a move that would anger many Conservatives who consider the Protestant church and the Burgundian identity to be inseparable. In the end, it is decided that….;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA47.A;Philip will become Arthur IV of Brittany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA47.B;Brittany will need to find another candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA48.T;The Coronation of Arthur IV;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA48.D;All across the duchy of Brittany, crowds have gathered to celebrate the coronation of the Burgundian prince Philip. Having arrived to the port of Saint-Malo, the legitimate heir of the last duchess Anne was welcomed by the local bishop who sanctified his conversion to Catholicism and the head of government, Pierre de Pontcallec, who informed the prince of the ceremony that would be held the next day in Rennes. To celebrate the independence of the nation, the ceremony followed closely the medieval order : Philip swore on the relics in front of the Porte Mordelaise to be a just sovereign and then entered the cathedral where he was crowned and hailed as Duke Arthur IV of Brittany in front of ambassadors from all Europe. The Duke promised to uphold his vows and strengthen the unity of the Breton nation. He then embarked on a royal tour of his new realm that proved a great success in the trying beginnings of the new nation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA48.A;Long live Arthur, duke of the Bretons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA49.T;Ducal Refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA49.D;The conquest of Brittany by the Anglo-French monarchy had not dissipated the rightful claims of the Burgundian monarchy on the duchy. Yet, despite the proposal of the Breton government to revive the duchy, Prince Philip of Burgundy refused the Crown because of his Protestant faith. With no other good prospects, the Regency Council has proclaimed the Breton Republic, hoping that the nation may endure despite this setback;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ENLFRA49.A;A free Brittany needs no Duke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x; 
ENLFRA490.T;The Dawn of a New Ireland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA490.D;For the first time in over a thousand years, Ireland is both fully independent and fully united. Joyous celebrations ring out across the Emerald Isle, as the hour that all sons and daughters of Erin have dreamed of finally comes to pass. It is true that many questions of our new nation remain unsettled, and that certain social issues which Paris allowed to persist will have to be addressed. A National Assembly will have to be swiftly established and convened to draft a constitution. For now, however, let us inaugurate this new era of Irish freedom and democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA490.A;Tá ár lá tagtha (Our day has come)!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA50.T;The Bráithreachas Phoblacht na hÉireann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA50.D;Founded in the wake of ideological failures of previous organizations such as Óg Éire (Young Ireland) in the earlier decades of the century, the Bráithreachas Phoblacht na hÉireann (Irish Republican Brotherhood) sought to achieve an independent, united, and democratic Irish republic. Now that this has been more or less achieved, many of their veterans have turned to a new task : attacking what they see as remnants of the Anglois regime. Many Irish nationalists have long despised the very presence of French languages in Ireland, let alone ethnic French and Anglo-French citizens. The end of the Dual Monarchy has left these former elites now suddenly vulnerable, and now more than a few BPÉ “circles” (cells) are turning their sights upon the Anglois communities of their “former oppressors”, especially in the eastern cities of Belfast, Dublin, and Cork;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA50.A;Irishmen attacking French imperialists? What’s the problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA50.B;These men take things too far, we must restore order!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA500.T;The Liberation of Old England;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA500.D;”Tis God that will wrought us this Miracle great, for to settle old England in Church and in State : \nThen let's spare for no cost, since the day is our own, and for great Beornia the heir to the throne.” - Beornia’s Hope, patriotic song\n\nAfter eight hundred years, the Norman yoke is broken! Beornia has reclaimed her birthright : all of Old England is now hers. The children of Ameriga have bridged the once-unfathomable gulf in power between themselves and the Anglois, emerging as the ultimate victor. Beornia has already begun integrating these lands into their realm, and their sovereign shall no doubt be crowned King of England. However, there does seem to be discontent in Old England as Beornia is working on removing what they consider to be foreign influences, such as "Angloisime" and Britonism, and that discontent may soon become a problem. After all, a prophet is never welcome in their home town…;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA500.A;Never again will England be a slave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA77.T;Growing Unrest in Southern England;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA77.D;"And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country." - Luke 4 : 24\n\nOur work in reclaiming England has encountered a small problem : some people do not want to be reclaimed. Despite moving the royal court to London, our new subjects still consider us foreigners. Discontent is highest among the French-influenced Catholic Anglois, who have been especially hostile. While we have accepted the Anglois within England - for now - we have also tried to limit their influence as we focus on consolidating our control of England. The end result is that the Anglois are growing resistant to our rule in general and we are losing control of England south of the Midlands. Our administration, still burdened by the transition from New Haven to London, cannot immediately respond to this threat. It seems inevitable that an uprising will occur - we must be prepared for whatever comes next, lest all our sacrifices be in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA77.A;When this is over, the Anglois shall get what they deserve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ENLFRA51.T;The Opening of the Irish National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA51.D;“The imposition of French upon Éire sent our history adrift among the accidents of translation. It tore our identity from all places, substituted arbitrary signs for picturesque and suggestive names, cut off the entail of feeling, separated the people from their forefathers by a deep gulf, corrupted their very organs, and abridged their power of expression. An Éire without an Irish language is a mere Fomorian shade.” – Ian Macbrele, representative for Donegal\n\nThe first session of the National Assembly, to draft the Irish constitution, has stirred bitter feelings. Hardliners have rallied behind Macbrele, a BPÉ veteran who calls for the unrestricted enforcement of Irish Goidelic and the suppression of Anglois in Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA51.A;A “unified” nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA52.T;The Irish Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA52.D;The National Assembly is reaching a turning point in its discourse. The main tension has been between the BPÉ, monarchists, and moderate republicans between the two. The moderates, while seeing the institution of monarchy as being irreversibly tainted by the Plantagenet dominion, are also distrustful of the BPÉ’s zealous chauvinism. The BPÉ defend the doctrine of militant Irish nationalism as being a necessary defense against further Anglois plots, with Macbrele even suggesting that it may be necessary to suspend democracy to save the republic. The monarchists, who count most of the French speakers in Ireland and many clan chiefs amongst their ranks, want to restore the institution of the High King of Ireland, a notion whose proponents ardently defend even if they cannot pin down the best candidate for the throne. By the end of the day, the Assembly has…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA52.A;Established the first fully constitutional Irish Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA52.B;Been seized by the BPÉ under Macbrele!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA52.C;Established a regency for the High Kingdom of Ireland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA53.T;An Díbeartha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA53.D;For centuries, the Anglois lords have held the Irish in their grip, using their stolen lands for their own profit. Now, the moral arc of the universe is once again leaning towards Éire. It began with a motion in the National Assembly to forbid the teaching of Anglois in schools. However, as debate began, the tenor of discourse – steered by BPÉ loyalists – grew more and more radical. Soon enough a much more forceful bill was passed which effectively forbade the former French nobility from owning land. Local communities are now passing ordinances to obtain said lands, with rural villages seeing outright armed seizure of Anglois held estates. The elites are now fleeing the island and the French cultural world is up in arms at this direct assault on their ethnolinguistic kin. But few in Ireland shed a tear for them – they know that, at long last, our nation is in the hands of its own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA53.A;Tiomáin amach na Fomhóraigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA54.T;The $YEAR$ Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA54.D;Tensions between the Irish Goidelic-speaking majority and the influential Anglois French minority have threatened to plunge the Emerald Isle into internecine warfare. Cooler heads, however, have prevailed. A measure has been passed which establishes Irish as the primary language of the nation, but which makes allowances for the use of Anglois in certain communities. While reactionaries have made baleful predictions that the measure will result in sustained Anglois nationalism, most people are just relieved to see the resolution of the crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA54.A;Let us hope that this brings us peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA55.T;An Anglois Conspiracy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA55.D;Our actions against the Anglois have drawn international attention. We have weathered the foreigners’ condemnation, but they may be turning to more drastic measures of retaliation. The security services have obtained evidence which indicates a possible conspiracy involving former Anglois lords in Ireland, backed by foreign support from multiple French-speaking nations. The exact details of the plan – if it even exists – are hard to determine, but it seems obvious that the Anglois would attempt to overthrow the government and implement one loyal to them. We should prepare for more turmoil in the coming months…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA55.A;The Anglois cannot be trusted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA56.T;The Dublin Putsch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA56.D;The Anglois have made their move. Having obtained weapons, men, and funding from abroad, they have organized militias sympathetic to their cause and have descended upon the city of Dublin. Their first target was Ian Macbrele, assassinated by a gunman posing as one of his clerks. Now, street by street, government forces and Anglois partisans clash over the fate of Ireland. With Macbrele out of the picture the BPÉ is rapidly splintering, and the Irish future seems up for grabs. If the Anglois manage to seize control, then they will likely revive their plan to establish a pro-French monarchy in Ireland – even though they have yet to find a monarch. An Irish officer named Padraig Rossa has distinguished himself during the fighting, and with the failure of the BPÉ to keep order in Ireland, some have voiced their support for an Irish monarchy with Rossa as its ceremonial leader. Whatever happens, it seems that Irish republicanism is about to return to hibernation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA56.A;The Anglois seize control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA56.B;Rossa crushes the rebels and is made High King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA57.T;The End of the Irish Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA57.D;The Anglois fought hard to preserve the institution of monarchy within Ireland, but their inability to put forward a suitable candidate has led to their farce coming to an end. The restoration of the Irish republic has forced the monarchists to admit defeat, and the Anglois have once more been driven out of the halls of power. The political changes which have occurred amongst Irish republicanism during its time in the shadows means that few people can predict what they will do now that they have been restored, but the era of the Anglois as the ruling class in Ireland has been irreversibly ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA57.A;Na fíor-Éireannaigh a bhí i réim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA58.T;The Crowning of Queen Victoria Plantagenet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ENLFRA58.D;The Regency Council of Ireland has finally found a suitable candidate for the Irish throne. The losses of the House of Plantagenet in the east has led to the dynasty being cast adrift throughout the nations of Europe, and now Princess Victoria Plantagenet has been convinced to come to Ireland and take up its crown. Victoria’s branch is closely related to the old Anglo-Norman families, and her father, former Duke Robert of Cornwall, possessed several brewing and shipping businesses in Ireland. The only question is what type of ruler she shall be. Victoria has a reputation for being an assertive and gregarious woman, skilled in “salon diplomacy” and unusually political. Her views on the Irish are rather unclear, and it seems equally as likely that she would “go native” and relegate the Anglois to a protected minority as she would seek to preserve their hegemony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ENLFRA59.D;“This is a righteous judgment against those loathsome tyrants, whose hands have been imbrued in much innocent blood. The efforts of the Anglois to perpetuate the bondage of Éire must perish. All Irish history points to the necessity of ultimate separation from England and France. The choice before us is between slavery in our own homes or independence on our own soil. We, who are the inheritors of a millennia-old revolutionary tradition, shed no tears for the passing of the Anglois slavers. To them, we say only this : Go hIfreann nó Páras leat!” – John Mcdermott, BPÉ President\n\nThe shattering of the Anglois monarchy for the second time has brought back Irish republicanism with a terrible vengeance. Queen Victoria was Damoclined in Dublin city center, and a nationwide purge of Anglois communities has begun. The French world is outraged and may soon seek vengeance against Éire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AEN_accept_english_desc;Nobody can deny that our experiences with the English have been less than pleasant. For years, centuries even, ours has been a relationship not of two partners, but of ruler and ruled. As our political institutions advance, however, and the passage of time begins to staunch and heal some of our two cultures’ more grievous wounds, there emerges the possibility of reaching a permanent settlement with the English. It would not be easy – we would have to accept the reality of a Britannia with an equitable, English-encompassing franchise, relinquishing the monopoly on power which we have so long held in the isle.

AEN_accept_irish_desc;Perhaps no part of the old Plantagenet domain has been so often overlooked as Ireland. Located at the furthest distance from the royal heartlands, Ireland has long been more valued for its agricultural production than any other facet – and their restive population, though less vexing than the Protestant English, has given plenty of Anglois officials headaches. Yet the Irish are a passionate and devoted people who would make far more useful friends than enemies. Unlike the English, the Irish are fellow Catholics, and many of them still speak at least passable French. By securing the cooperation of the Irish, we will cement our hold on the Britonne Isles. Extending full rights to them will still not be easy – we would have to greatly reduce the monopoly on power we have so long held in the Emerald Isle.

accepted_provencal_FRA;Ever since the emergence of modern French nationalism, most of our scholars and politicians have fiercely denied the existence of a separate “Occitan” nationality, seeing it as a threat to French unity. Now, however, as our political institutions develop, liberal scholars are rediscovering old texts in southern vernaculars. Investigations are being made into the ways in which southern culture – especially in the realm of music and performance – influenced France since the medieval age. Furthermore, the sharpening of “Occitanism” amongst the southerners, regardless of our thoughts on the matter, has led to the idea becoming a potent political force. If we are to have a truly united France, then we can no longer afford to deny the Provençals their rights and traditions.

It is true that Lorraine has changed in the last thousand years, having become an integral core part of Burgundy.

So did the ability for it to continue to rule over Afghanistan and rather a minor tribal leader outside of Kabul would be named its King instead of the Afsharids. This king would go on to perform the impossible task of liberating a good portion of the Sikhs from the rule of the Mughal Empire but ultimately fail to perform any further conquest due to a entire generation being effectively killed in the bloodbath required to achieve such a feat. Two more kings have past and now with information from the west signalling the end of the Ottoman Civil War and either its collapse or decline, it is time to finally begin our duty of conquering the west by starting with the nation where our Kingdom had been established from: The Afsharid Dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HND001.T;The Mughal Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND001.D;The Mughal Empire was once the sole ruler of the Subcontinent, but the reactionary policies of Emperor Aurangzeb had put an end to this golden age, starting a long era of decline. In the late 18th and early 19th Century, the far majority of princes decided to break off from Delhi with the backing of European powers. Beroda sided with the Scandinavians, the Marathas went with Spain, while Nagpur and Hyderabad went with Burgundy. As various smaller princedoms also managed to break off, the Durrani were able to seize Punjab while the Nazim of Bengal declared its independence. In 1820, the disintegration of the Empire was temporarily halted by the deposition of the inept emperor by the reformist Prince of Delhi. Will the Mughal Empire reverse its decline or will the machinations of its often disloyal army and nobility put a definitive end to the dynasty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND001.A;It feels as if the Empire has only twenty years of life left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.T;Sharia Law and the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.D;Emperor Aurangzeb has implemented full Sharia law during his reign, and after the period of imperial collapse in the 18th and Early 19th Century it has been thoroughly proven that this is likely one of the main reasons why the empire had entered a state of terminal decline in the first place. However, outright repealing Sharia Law is likely to piss off the far majority of Islamic nobles in the empire and may even lead to a military coup if the Empire is unable to suppress their efforts. Is it better to appease the Hindu Princes or appease the Islamic Nobles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND002.A;We must repeal it for the sake of the empire (Concessions are possible);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND003.D;The land of Bundelkhand is also well known as a land of traitors as back in the 17th and early 18th Century there was a revolt there by a Indian prince known as Chhatrasal. Though the efforts of one of our greatest generals he was defeated and the land has not revolted since, but it may revolt again if the Empire is unable to give autonomy and protections to the rulers in the region before the inevitable war with Bengal occurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND01.T;The Inevitable Invasion of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.D;Without a doubt, the Nazims of Bengal declaring their independence as the Sultanate of Bengal during the early 19th Century was by far the most embarrassing and destructive moment in the history of the Mughal Empire. The Empire has been avoiding a confrontation with the east for many years because of the potentially destabilizing effect it could have on its Hindu subjects but now it seems that the situation has changed. Several military commanders have broken ranks and decided to directly invade Bengal without any orders from the Emperor and Bengal has responded with a deceleration of war against the Mughal Empire. All overtures of peace have failed and at this point it seems that total war is inevitable and utterly unavoidable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.T;Bengal has fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.D;At some point in the past decade, Bengal had fallen into the hands of a foreign power. Already our inability to regain the rogue province has created a catastrophic destabilizing effect in our empire and with our nobility out for blood and blaming the Hindu Princes for our failure it is likely that the situation will dissolve into a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.T;The Mughals have returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.D;The Mughal Empire has declared that they would finally regain their lost territory from us. The idea of neutrality that the Sultan has been perusing no longer suits us any more, it is time for us to re-militarise and put all our effort into fighting this extreme threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.A;We were preparing for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.T;Signs of Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.D;There has been signs of dissent between the Hindu Princes as many have denounced the autonomous actions from our military as a sign that Delhi is completely unable to keep any element of the Empire under control any-more. The Durbar has responded with the counter-argument that these generals were rogue and that the government had attempted peace with the Bengal Sultanate before it declared war itself. This counter-argument is left unanswered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.A;This was not our fault. I swear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.T;Complete Chaos in the Mughal Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.D;As we had expected, it seems that a state of total chaos has erupted throughout the Mughal Empire as various minority groups attack each other relentlessly. The Hindus fight the Muslims and the various Nazims and Princes throughout our empire are already considering declaring independence from our rapidly collapsing empire. It seems that we are in a very dire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.A;WHY IS EVERYONE SO ANGRY ABOUT BENGAL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.T;The Mughal Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.D;The Mughal Empire has been in various states of the decline for the past century and a half but the greatest loss was that of the critically important lands of Bengal. Any attempt to regain Bengal would have had serious consequences and when a completely autonomous and illegal invasion of Bengal by rogue Mughal generals occurred, nationalist and religious tensions would cause the country to completely collapse into a bloodbath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.A;I hope the Europeans are not watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.T;The Mughals have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND07.A;We win. They lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.T;The Sultanate of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.D;The Sultanate of Bengal was created when the Nazims of Bengal declared independence during the catastrophic decline of the Mughal Empire. Bengal would prosper for a time after that but soon run into tensions when both Muslim and Hindu groups started relentlessly attacking each other over what they both considered their rightful territory, the Sultan would put a stop to this by doing the unthinkable: political neutrality. If the Sultan of Bengal would promise not to attempt to conquer more Hindu subjects then the Islamic population would never find themselves outnumbered, the Islamic subjects of Bengal were appeased with this and the Hindu subjects would tolerate it. However the fact that Bengal cannot peruse military conquest for now is crippling. It seems that it would take a crisis of some form to break this unfortunate situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND11.D;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND11.B;We will not force ourselves upon $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HND12.T;The Spices of Mysore;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND13.T;The Question of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND13.D;Bengal is a territory in the north-east of Hindustan that has always remained exceptionally valuable to any nation that has held it. Unfortunately, Bengal is now considering itself a self-standing independent nation and that is wasting valuable resources that could be used in the hands of Europeans. We should request their immediate annexation and invade them if they refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND30.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ demands our Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND30.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared that we are to be immediately annexed into their empire under the threat of war. However, the Sultan has another plan. He had attended the conference that had created the "Confederate Institution for Indian Civilization" and even if he had ultimately refused the offer that had been presented there with the idea that Bengal has no need for a "Confederation". He would still enact a similar plan to the southern princes and give concessions to the Europeans (such as Southern Bengal), before using the peace created by these concessions to successfully westernise Bengal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND31.T;The Sultan's Counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND31.D;The Sultan of Bengal has presented us with a set of concessions and immediate submission under the terms of the Hindustan Act. We are obliged to agree, lest we annoy every Great Power on the planet as refusal has diplomatic implications regarding our blatant ignorance of the Hindustan Act that could be catastrophic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND14.T;Trade Company Manipulation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND14.D;Ever since the conclusion of the Hindustan Conference, the western corporations and businesses in $COUNTRY$ have done all they can to take over every layer of our government. As we had taken the path of opening up to western nations we have very little or no choice in the matter of being able to avoid their influence. Soon we may even lose our independence to the very nations that once told us that it was our goal to westernise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND17.T;The Auspicious Meeting - Maharashtra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND17.D;A prince from Maharashtra has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. He will also permit any coastal concessions that we demand and he will give us access to the full economy of his wealthy lands. The creation of this princely state is likely to be far more profitable then just taking the lands that we need as we will have full cooperation of its leadership, rather then another highly hostile colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND18.T;Maharashtra Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND18.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has permitted one of our northern princes to kneel to $FROMCOUNTRY$ at the same time as demanding various territorial concessions, before any of our relatively outdated military assets had a chance to stop him from doing so. The territory had already been garrisoned by $FROMCOUNTRY$ and since have very little chance in fighting modern European military assets, we must relent or give them a excuse to entirely integrate us into their growing empire regardless of our present westernisation progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND20.T;Hyderabad Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND20.D;One of our princes have effectively signed away our full independence in the vain hope that this will prevent our annexation by $FROMCOUNTRY$. He would be correct of course, this concession will prevent our ultimate destruction by $FROMCOUNTRY$. But at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND21.T;The Auspicious Meeting - Gwalior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND21.D;A prince from Gwalior has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. However, unlike other concessions this one is unlikely to give us anything apart from a vassal which will of course be useful in blocking other European nations from expanding beyond the centre of India but economically worthless. Should we give this prince the autonomy he needs, or will we just continue our intent to annex his nation. Remember, if we refuse this offer he may take this to another nation and they will put this territory under their control rather then us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND22.T;Gwalior Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND29.T;Conquest of Punjab;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND29.D;The Governor of Mulasthan has requested that we intervene in the newly independent state of Punjab to secure our interests in this region. Since Punjab is likely to become a detriment to our interests in the region due to its high population and claims over Delhi, it would be well advised to listen to the Governor of Mulasthan in this matter and establish a protectorate over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This organization presently claims most of Central India as a neutral or "princely" zone but if any European nation were to organize colonies that directly conflict with these claims then they would have to accept such reorganizations.

ZHO1.T;The Yaluo League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO1.D;Yaluo is the youngest Zhourao state, with a recent origin after the Kongsi War, wherein Yaluo fought for its independence and won against the patrician rule of Mianjin. A coalition of peasant secret societies, democratic mining communities and Hongshan tribes has formed the basis of the new League, based on democratic ideals of liberty and equality. This has led to a relative period of peace in Zhourao, with the various powers interested in the area mostly agreeing to stay away from the continent. However, growing tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo might very well break the peace in the coming decade, while internal tensions still run high as the internal compromise threatens to break..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO1.A;The key to success is action, and in action, it is necessary to persevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO2.T;The Red Sultans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO2.D;The Sultanate of Zhusha is the oldest Zhourao area of settlement. Ruled like the southern settlements by a Christian oligarchy descended from Qingqiuese settlers, a rebellion saw the masses of the North rally behind the banner of Ma Zicheng, a prominent Hui leader in Butingshan. Backed by the Muslim sufi societies spread by Malay traders, he proclaimed himself Sultan and fought several wars against his southern neighbor although he was unable to unify Zhourao. Yet the Sultanate has flourished thanks to their position : they control the trade from Nusantara, and the court in Butingshan has developed a solid system of governance that mixes Islamic thought with Confucianism. Yet they have grown increasingly reliant on the Dual-Monarchy, always eager to expand their markets. Will the Sultanate manage to shake the status quo? Or should the Red Sultans continue their lives until they are mere puppets of colonial powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO2.A;God willing, the country must unite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO3.T;The Middle Kongsi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO3.D;The Mianjin Republic is the center - in all meanings of the word - of Zhourao. Founded by Christian merchants from Qingqiu, it developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China. The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the North, established several contacts with the Maori tribes and secured the naval roads to Qingqiu while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state has provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the recent League of Yaluo. Recently Chairman of the Assembly Liu Xishan has been granted exceptional powers to stabilize the situation, but many wonder if his ambitions will not change the fabric of Mianjin entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO3.A;The Middle Kongsi shall unify the continent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO4.T;The Port-Anne Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO4.D;While the port of Carpenterie is the heart of the Burgundian colony of Nouvelle-Zélande, it is controlled in large part by the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC), the Burgundian East India Company. While the company administrators to the north grow rich off the lucrative sandalwood trade, little of that wealth makes its way back to Burgundy. Our government has attempted to circumvent the VOC's monopoly by establishing the colonial outpost of Port-Anne to the south, at the headwaters of the Rivière des Cygnes. Using penal labor, mostly Dutch malcontents, we have carved out a permanent presence in Zhourao. The local Nounegare tribes have proved hostile to further colonization inland, but have slowly warmed to the prospect of trade and proselytisation by our missionaries. Time will tell if Port-Anne will prove a true rival to Carpenterie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO4.A;We shall have our share of this new land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO5.T;The Nouvelle-Zélande Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO5.D;With the Burgundian royal colony centered in Port-Anne expanding further inland and now surrounding the VOC territory of Carpenterie, many within our government have deemed it high time that we put an end to the company's independent mandate in northwest Zhourao. An act has been tabled to parliament which would establish a formal colonial government across all of Nouvelle-Zélande, including Carpenterie. The VOC would lose all administrative powers within the territory, and be forced to place its possessions and armed forces there under the control of the crown. A token nationalization payment is being offered in exchange, but all accept that Carpenterie's integration into the wider colony is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO5.A;Carpenterie shall be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO6.T;Nationalisation of Carpenterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO6.D;The steady expansion of the Burgundian royal colony centered in Port-Anne has doomed our continued presence in Zhourao. The government in Burgundy has always been envious of the wealth we have extracted from the local sandalwood trade, and always looked for ways to undermine our presence. Now, an act has been tabled to parliament which would establish a formal colonial government across all of Nouvelle-Zélande, including Carpenterie. We would lose all administrative powers within the territory, and be forced to place its possessions and armed forces there under the control of the crown. A token nationalization payment is being offered to us in exchange, but all accept that Carpenterie's integration into the wider colony is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO6.A;We have little choice in the matter : Sell them the port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO7.T;The Zongting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO7.D;The Zongting, or Assembly Hall, is the parliament of Yaluo. It is made up of delegates from our constituent Hui, democratic miner's societies who run the day to day administration of each of our settlements. Most members of the Hui are descendants of the original colonists from Qingqiu. An outsider finding his way onto the membership lists of the Hui is a rare thing indeed. The delegates to the Zonting are elected entirely by members of the Hui, a tradition which some say limits our claims that Yaluo is a land of freedom and opportunity. In recent times, the issue of membership lists in the Hui has come under scrutiny. The majority of the population, particularly the peasantry, are scarcely represented and the number of Hongshan on the membership lists can be counted on one hand. There are those who would open up the membership lists to all working men, even including the League's Hongshan allies amongst the lists. Others say membership should only be offered to those who proved their loyalty by fighting in the war for our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO7.A;Maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO7.B;Give membership to those who fought alongside us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO7.C;Open the membership lists to all working men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO8.T;Hongshan Tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO8.D;During the Kongsi War, the Zongting sought allies amongst the Hongshan tribes spread throughout the interior. Many signed treaties of friendship with our people, fighting beside us against the oppressors in Wheizhou. Their support was not unconditional : The tribes were told that after the war they would receive their fair share of tribute from our gold mines. Now, with independence secured, the Hongshan are calling in the debt. A delegation of tribal chiefs have arrived in Qingshui requesting that the Zongting formally grant them a share of the gold profits from our mines. While some Hui have already been doing this, many of the Hui in the northeast have been refusing to pay them the promised tribute. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that since independence many lucrative mines and settlements have been established in the interior of Yaluo on traditional Hongshan land, with the tribesmen consenting on the basis that they would be given their share of the wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO8.A;We owe nothing to these barbarians, prepare to crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO8.B;We can pay them a part of our treasury to appease both sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO8.C;We will force the northern Hui to pay tribute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO9.T;The Frontier Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO9.D;The situation in the tribal frontier of Yaluo has grown dire. Several Hongshan tribes have been angered enough by our refusal to pay them their promised tribute that they have risen up in rebellion, waging a guerilla war against our forces in the north. Violent clashes between the Hongshan and local Hui are now a daily occourence. Our mining operations and settlements in the area are in real jeopardy. We now have no choice but to deploy troops to restore order and subjugate the rebellious tribes, a move that will be intensely unpopular amongst liberal-minded delegates to the Zongting who believed we have betrayed our Hongshan allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO9.A;If they want war, we will give them war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO10.T;Scandinavia Wants to Operate Businesses in Yaluo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO10.D;The Zongting has received an intriguing offer from a consortium of Scandinavian businesses interested in operating inside the territory of Yaluo. Arriving in Qingshui, they have presented plans to build factories in the capital and connect our mining settlements in the interior via railroad. These men claim that Yaluo will benefit from their investment, and there may be some truth to that : opening up to the West may bring us a measure of wealth and help our efforts to modernize. Yet some in the Zongting have reacted angrily to the proposal. Many delegates worry that Scandinavia, which already has a presence on the island of Vargø to the south, may seek to supplant the Kongsi and establish a colony on mainland Zhourao. They see Western investment as the first step towards colonial subjugation. In response, some delegates have proposed a compromise in which the Scandinavians could establish themselves in our port cities, but not the interior of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO10.A;We will have no intervention by the West in Zhourao!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO10.B;We will allow them a presence in our ports, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO10.C;We are open to investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO11.T;Our Businessmen Rebuffed in Yaluo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO11.D;A situation is developing in Yaluo, the southernmost of the three independent states located in Zhourao. It has long been our ambition to use the island colony of Vargø as a springboard to expand into mainland Zhourao, and enlarging our economic and political influence in Yaluo is a logical step towards achieving that goal. Yet now a scheme formulated by several Scandinavian businessmen to build railroads and factories within Yaluo has gone awry. Their delegation has been expelled from the country, with the local parliament decreeing that Yaluo is henceforth closed to Scandinavian investment and influence. Undoubtedly there are those in Yaluo who know of our ambitions and seek to thwart them. While this is undoubtedly a setback, it could also be an opportunity. Were we to use this insult as a pretext for war, we could weaken Yaluo and extract concessions from them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO11.A;They will face our navy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO11.B;We cannot spend resources on a colony on the other side of the planet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO12.T;Scandinavia Declares War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO12.D;Our rejection of the Scandinavian businessmen's petition to operate within the League’s territory was received very poorly in Copenhagen. This morning we received a small delegation from the Scandinavian military who announced in terse terms that Scandinavia has declared war in response to our actions. Given the precarious position of the League of Yaluo, defeat in this conflict could mean the end of our independence. We must not fail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO12.A;And so we shall not fail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO120.T;The Treaty of Qinghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO120.D;We have been defeated by Scandinavia and as expected their peace terms were harsh. The entire city of Qinghui has been ceded in perpetuity to Scandinavia, all port cities in the League of Yaluo have been opened to Scandinavian merchants, and a Scandinavian official has been installed as a permanent member of the Zongting with the power to overrule its decisions. Suffice to say we are now a mere appendage of the Nordics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO120.A;The light of freedom becomes ever fainter…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO13.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Surrenders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO13.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has capitulated and availed itself to our peace terms. In the resulting peace treaty, we have secured the cession of a vital trade port to our direct control, opened the rest of their port cities to our merchants, and have installed a Scandinavian official in their ruling council to oversee their affairs. Suffice to say their nation is now within our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO13.A;Civilization triumphs over barbarism once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO14.T;Scandinavia Demands Weizhou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO14.D;Scandinavia has coveted our lands ever since they first established their Vargø colony. We have done our best to keep them at arm’s reach by confining their merchants to the city of Weizhou, but their recent aggressive expansion into the lands held by the southern rebels has only worsened their greed. Now the Scandinavian ambassador has come before us with a ridiculous story that several Scandinavian businessmen have lost “almost all” of their recent shipments into Weizhou, and they blame the corruption of our officials for this. In all likelihood these men were engaged in black market business elsewhere in Mianjin and are now trying to write off their sales. The truly shocking part was that Scandinavia sees this as evidence that Weizhou must be leased to them in order to supervise the city’s trade! As Weizhou is our main business center, this would sign our nation’s whole economy into Nordic hands, placing our independence in doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO14.A;Absolutely not! We shall defend our freedom to the death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO14.A;War would be futile…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO15.T;Mianjin has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO15.D;The Mianjinese were unreasonable and refused to even entertain the possibility of granting our request. They have accused us of subterfuge and stated in no uncertain terms that Scandinavian merchants will no longer be allowed within their territory. This is of course completely unacceptable and a declaration of war upon Mianjin has already been voted through the Landsting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO15.A;No one provokes us with impunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO16.T;Mianjin has Accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO16.D;After days of bitter and vexatious negotiations, the Mianjinese have finally agreed to most of our demands. The resulting Treaty of Weizhou has ceded the city of Weizhou to Scandinavia, opened the rest of Mianjin’s port cities to our merchants, and has installed a Scandinavian official in Mianjin’s ruling council to oversee their affairs. Suffice to say their nation is now within our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO16.A;How eminently reasonable of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO17.T;The Treaty of Weizhou;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO17.D;We have been defeated by Scandinavia and as expected their peace terms were harsh. The entire city of Weizhou has been ceded in perpetuity to Scandinavia, all port cities in the Mianjin Republic have been opened to Scandinavian merchants, and a Scandinavian official has been installed as a permanent member of the Assembly with the power to overrule its decisions. Suffice to say we are now a mere appendage of the Nordics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO17.A;We have truly fallen far…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO18.T;Hongshan Tribes Formally Join the League;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO18.D;The Zongting forcing the northeastern Hui to give the Hongshan tribes their promised tribute has angered a conservative minority within Yaluo, but earned us the friendship and loyalty of the Hongshan tribes. Relations between our peoples are better than they have ever been, and Yaluo can truly claim to be a beacon of unity and equality across Zhourao. Now, a new reform will strengthen our bonds of fellowship even further. A law has been passed by the Zongting granting each Hongshan tribe full and equal membership in the League alongside the Hui, allowing each to send their own delegate. The expanded League will guarantee the rights and equality of all its people and expand its borders north and west into the tribal territory of the local Hongshan tribes. While the tyrants in Mianjin sneer at our acceptance of the so-called "barbarians," we know that we have much to learn from the ancient culture and stewardship of the Hongshan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO18.A;Together, we will march into a bright future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO19.T;Delegates to the Zongting Propose Reunification with Mianjin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO19.D;When the Hui of southwest Zhourao rebelled against Mianjin, we believed that we were standing up for the democratic traditions of the Kongsi, in which all members have an equal voice. Yet since independence we have stayed true to our traditions and not been carried away by the winds of change. We refused those who wished us to abandon more than a century of tradition, and are stronger for it. As a result many are coming to realize we have more in common with the Hui of Mianjin than we do the Hongshan, the Europeans, or the monarchists in Zhusha. Now, with the threat of a Second Kongsi War looming, a motion has been passed by the Zongting to send a delegation to Weizhou seeking peaceful reintegration of our Hui back into the Mianjin Kongsi. We will lose our independence, but together, we may be able to weather the coming storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO19.A;Unity is strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO19.B;Unity is strength! (PLAYER ONLY : Play as Mianjin);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO20.T;Reunification with Yaluo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO20.D;The political balance between ourselves and Yaluo has grown more stable and harmonious than ever before in recent years. It seems that our people are finally recognizing their common ground, made all the more important by the increase of foreign imperialism in the region. Now we have received news that the Yaluo Zongting has voted to seek peaceful reunification with us! This is joyous news, and the finest balm we could ask for to heal the wounds of the Kongsi War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO20.A;May our peoples never be divided again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO21.T;Northeastern Hui Defect to Mianjin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO21.D;Dissatisfied with the reforms implemented by the Zongting, the more conservative Huis in the north have defected back to Mianjin! They declare that the Yaluo Kongsi has gone too far and strayed from its popular mandate to embrace radicalism against the wishes of the people. The truth is that these cowards are likely making a desperate attempt to protect their economic interests from the expansion of egalitarianism within the League. More than likely, Mianjin organized this entire sequence of events with honeyed promises from their decadent patrician families. We will not take this lying down! The time has come to strike down Mianjin forever and bring unity to Zhourao through the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO21.A;The Zongting votes for war and war it shall have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO22.T;The Second Kongsi War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO22.D;In 1825, the Kongsi War came to an end and we found Mianjin divided by the traitorous League of Yaluo. From that day forward we have always known that this situation could not last. The political gulf between our nations has only deepened as the southern rebels fell deeper and deeper into the abyss of radicalism. Recently a group of northeastern Hui contacted us to pledge their loyalty to Mianjin and return to the fold, in light of Yaluo’s increasing governmental madness. Yet rather than recognize this decision made by the will of the people, the League of Yaluo has seized upon it as justification for war! The time has come to finish what we started and put down the League’s rebellion as we should have done in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO22.A;We shall pen the final chapter of this tale of division!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO23.T;The People Answer Our Call;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO23.D;"We swear by the League to stand truly by each other, and fight to defend our rights and liberties." - Yaluo militiamen's oath.\nWhile the Northeastern Hui have abandoned us, the people have not! All across Yaluo, a surging tide of workingmen have taken up arms in defense of the League. Our reforms, which the nay-sayers insisted would weaken our unity, have convinced every man in Yaluo that the League is worth fighting and dying for. In Qingshui, thousands of men have come forward to enlist, some fresh off the boat from China. They are joined by a handful of European's adamant to prove their loyalty. The Hongshan tribes mobilize in the interior. In every town and settlement, the Hui have called upon every man on the lists. As one, Yaluo marches to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO23.A;Freedom is strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO24.T;Changyun in 1836;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO24.D;Changyun, the “island of the Long Cloud,” was discovered in the XVIIIth century by Mianjinese traders on their way to Qingqiu. They managed to secure a treaty port on the North island during the Musket Wars that plagued the island after the same traders sold new weapons to the Maori tribes. After the weakening of the tribes the Mianjin kongsi established a permanent forum between the different iwi (confederations of tribes), so as to secure their control on the island, leading to the formation of the ‘United Tribes of Changyun’. However, this state barely exists beyond the Mianjinese meeting place in Yongting. Furthemore, a popular Maori rangatira (chief) named Tapua Te Rauangaanga is known to prefer Scandinavia to Mianjin and to be an avid military scholar. It is rumored that he entertains the idea of securing a kingdom over the whole island - and perhaps even expelling us in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO24.A;Such intrigue in that beautiful land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO25.T;Tapua Te Rauangaanga Proclaimed Te Arikinu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO25.D;Tapua Te Rauangaanga is a young and charismatic rangatira (chief) within the Hauraki iwi (confederation of tribes), who live in central Changyun. Ever since he could read, Tapua was fascinated by stories and mythology, especially the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He is also a long-time trading partner of Scandinavia, viewing Mianjin with suspicion and referring to Assembly Chairman Liu Xishan as “a lesser Liu Bei.” Having furnished his soldiers with European guns, he first secured the loyalty of the Hauraki and then embarked on a campaign to force all other iwi to either submit to him or face destruction. As a longtime military scholar with the best troops on the island, he has now exacted the support of the majority of iwi. At a ceremony in Yongting attended by scores of rangatira, he proclaimed himself Te Arikinui o Aotearoa, the King of the North Island! Mianjin will be outraged by the dissolution of the Changyun council, unless we, like Cao Cao, feign loyalty and wait for the right moment...or if we ask Scandinavia to aid us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO25.A;Ka tatari tatou kia ngoikore ratou. (We wait for them to weaken.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO25.B;Karangatia nga pakeha ke! (Call upon the Europeans!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO26.T;A New Order in Changyun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO26.D;Tapua Te Rauangaanga has recently conducted a rapid and aggressive campaign against rival tribal leaders in Changyun, forcing them to either submit to his authority or face destruction by his rifle-armed troops. He has even gone so far as to dissolve the United Tribes of Changyun and create a unified Kingdom of Aotearoa in its place. However, he has hosted our ambassadors amicably and wants to pursue trade with Mianjin in good faith. It is highly disturbing that we were not aware of the amount of Scandinavian weapons which he had amassed, and that we were unable to intervene before he could complete his lightning offensive. Despite this, few patricians are worried - they see this as nothing more than a tribal squabble, and doubt that his so-called “kingdom” will last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO26.A;As long as trade flows, they can have a single king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO27.T;An Opportunity in Oceanie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO27.D;Tapua Te Rauangaanga, an influential Maori chief on the northern half of the pair of Oceanien islands known in Scandinavia as Ny Sjaelland, has been a steadfast trading partner of Scandinavia for many years, having purchased no small amount of military goods from us for his soldiers. Now he has won a series of battles across the Maori lands and proclaimed himself king of both islands. However the Mianjin Republic disputes his claim, asserting their protectorate status over the Maori, and is preparing to launch an expedition to destroy his nascent kingdom. Thus Tapua Te Rauangaanga has prevailed upon us, the only European power that he trusts, to aid him against the Mianjin. While he has claimed authority over both islands, in truth his influence only extends to the northern one and we may be able to negotiate for settlement rights in the south if we successfully defend him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO27.A;Another protect… I mean, alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO27.B;We cannot commit to such an action at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO28.T;The Changyun Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO28.D;Tapua Te Rauangaanga has long been regarded with suspicion in Mianjin due to both his charisma amongst his fellow Maori and his enthusiasm for military matters. Now, in a series of rapid battles against rival iwi (tribes), he has dissolved the United Tribes of Changyun and proclaimed himself Te Arikinui o Aotearoa - the King of the North Island! Yungang is now being besieged by his forces and if not reinforced will soon fall. However we have also received word from the Scandinavian representative in Weizhou that the Maori warlord is now under their official protection. If we attack “Aotearoa” now, Scandinavia will defend them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO28.A;We must accept this new state of affairs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO28.B;Changyun will be liberated, the Scandinavians be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO29.T;Aotearoa Rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO29.D;Chairman Liu of the Mianjin Assembly has proven to be no Liu Bei at all, but a mere paper tiger. The only response which we have received from the Mianjin is a curt recognition of the dissolution of the United Tribes of Changyun. For the first time since the arrival of the foreigners, the people of Aotearoa are free and united! The one ominous sign on the horizon is that Scandinavia has raised the question of receiving permission to establish a settlement in recognition of their role in forcing the Mianjin to back down. But that is a matter to discuss in the future. For now, let us bask in the light of liberty, which finally illuminates our homeland so long divided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO29.A;He rite tatou ki nga kapua! (We are as free as the clouds!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO30.T;War for the Fate of Aotearoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO30.D;Mianjin did not accept our declaration of independence, declaring Changyun to be “in a state of insurrection” and has announced their intent to restore the Council of the United Tribes by force! In anticipation of the struggle to come, Te Arikinui has sent forth a call to all the iwi of Aotearoa, commanding them to muster all men of fighting age and send them to the royal court for orders. If we fail in our fight for liberty then Aotearoa may never be united again! The future of our people is in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO30.A;Me tu tatou katoa ki te whawhai! (We must all stand up and fight!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO31.T;The Maori Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO31.D;Tapua Te Rauangaanga has long been regarded with suspicion in Mianjin due to both his charisma amongst his fellow Maori and his enthusiasm for military matters. Now, after winning a series of rapid battles against rival iwi (tribes), he has dissolved the United Tribes of Changyun and proclaimed himself Te Arikinui o Aotearoa - the King of the North Island! Yungang is now being besieged by his forces and if not reinforced will soon fall. Rumors within the Scandinavian quarter in Weizhou suggest that the Maori warlord had sought protection from the Scandinavian military but was refused by them. If true, then this rebellion was even more well-organized than we had thought, and it must be immediately put down before any other power tries to intervene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO31.A;By order of the Chairman, crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO32.T;The Colonization of Southern Ny Sjaelland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO32.D;Our successful defense of Aotearoa has enabled us to negotiate for settlement rights in the southern half of Ny Sjaelland. A favorable location for the first community has been found, a few colonial officials from Vargø have been transferred eastwards to set up the new administration, and advertisements of the fair climate and excellent agricultural opportunities have been posted in cities across the nation. This may cause future problems with the more centralized Maori kingdom in the north but for now we shall reap the harvest of this new frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO32.A;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO33.T;The Storming of Yungang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO33.D;Mianjin has found itself embroiled in a full-scale war with one of its neighbors. This has forced them to withdraw all but the most essential military personnel from Yungang for the war effort. This sparked an argument between Te Arikinui and his advisors as to whether to attempt to seize the city and purge our lands of Mianjin’s influence once and for all. Eventually he decided to take the risk, ordering an assault upon Yungang. As it turned out the city’s remaining Mianjin garrison had arranged their defenses to repel a naval invasion from Mianjin’s enemies, not a land attack from us, allowing our rapid conquest of Yungang. Mianjin may retaliate if they survive their current war but for now they are in no position to take revenge. At long last, we have freed ourselves from foreign rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO33.A;Ka hoki ki nga kokonga katoa o te motu! (The island is ours again!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO34.T;The Yungang Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO34.D;Our current war has forced us to withdraw all non-essential personnel from the city of Yungang on the island of Changyun. This presented an irresistible temptation to the Maori ruler Te Arikinui Tapua Te Rauangaanga, who led his men, armed with guns stockpiled from years of trading with Scandinavia, to besiege the city. It is unfortunate, then, that we had instructed the remnants of Yungang’s garrison to prepare against a naval invasion, not an attack by land from the Maori, whom we had not expected to betray us. The city has now been lost and with it any remaining influence which we held in Changyun. If we want to recover said influence in the future then force may be our only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO34.A;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO35.T;The Qingqiuan Connection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO35.D;China may be the ultimate origin of our culture, but Qingqiu was the nation which founded our own. This connection has only deepened with the rise of the Pacific trade in the 18th century, and Qingqiu and their mastery of the Pacific trade is second to none beside the Middle Kingdom itself. It is therefore frustrating that Mianjin’s navy - or for that matter, our shipworks and naval academies - has struggled to match that of our Arcadian counterparts. There are many reasons for this, ranging from a lack of suitable instructors to patrician dominance of the shipyards and the general obscurity of our nation in the eyes of the world, but the rapid speed of naval development amongst the foreign regimes eyeing our territory has finally driven the Assembly to pass serious maritime modernization laws. This includes opening a state-run naval engineering school attached to the Republican Navy, and a program for Qingqiuan naval officers to instruct and to train our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO35.A;The land nourishes us, but the sea is our future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO36.T;The Weizhou Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO36.D;Spanish missionaries in the Order of Saint Augustine are allowed within Mianjin, but have attracted few converts. The Sufi orders have been more successful amongst both the Hongshan and the Zhourao, who feel more comfortable with its syncretism. Chairman Liu, a Christian, is notoriously suspicious of the Hui and sees the Sufi orders and their popularity as a threat to national security. Now an Augustinian orphanage in Weizhou has been denounced by a local Sufi lodge for kidnapping a boy named Phoa Ishak. He became greatly ill as an infant and was secretly baptized by a Catholic servant who feared that Ishak would die. The Bishop of Australie recently learned of this and ordered that Ishak be taken back into the orphanage, as it is against Catholic law for a baptized child to be raised by non-Catholics. The lodge to which the Phoas belong is now demanding his return. The orphanage insists that Ishak is happily Catholic and that his release would be a breach of both his own desires and of the friars’ oath to the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO36.A;The Augustinians were justified, chastise the Sufis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO36.B;Propose an equitable trial in a court of law for Ishak’s custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO36.C;Return the boy to his family and reprimand the friars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO37.T;The Rise of the Xinjiao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO37.D;A new Sufi order in Zhusha known as the Xinjiao has begun to open lodges across the nation. The Xinjao are modernists who want a purified, literalist Islam, in opposition to other forms of Sufism which they allege have been too conciliatory to other faiths to the point of diluting their religion and even committing shirk (the Islamic sin of idolatry or polytheism). They emphasize the supreme authority of the Holy Quran and embrace only a small number of hadiths (reported words and actions of the Prophet Muhammed, often supplementing the Quran itself). The Xinjao are sponsored by Malay traders who have made the Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca), and are influenced by developments in Islamic jurisprudence within Arabia. In addition to this theological rigidity, they stress the importance of temperance, zakat (the Islamic concept of holy charity), and education, making them quite popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO37.A;Intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO38.T;Developments of the Jinxingtang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO38.D;the Jingxingtang, meaning Gold Star Hall after the magnificent hall commissioned by the first Sultan, Ma Zicheng\Muhammad to be built next to the Gongbei of the Sufi Master Hu Qixi, is the most prominent sufi order of the Sultanate. Since the formation of the Sultanate, this school of thought has worked to reconcile Islam and Confucianism, notably with the Han Kitab, a collection of Islamic texts combining Han, for Chinese, with Kitab, the Arab word for book. Their academy has thus developed into both a madrasah and a Chinese academy, with courses on the Quran alongside the Chinese classics. The Jinxingtang thus acts both as a Sufi order, one of the highest education centers of the country and also a provider of most of the highest officials of the state that pass the state examinations..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO38.A;The teachings of the Sages of East and West, today as in ancient times, are one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO39.T;Repercussions of the Weizhou Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO39.D;The Red Sultan has been since the first Sultan Ma Zicheng, Commander of the Faithful, the most prestigious title in the Islamic word beneath the Caliphate. His word thus holds values for all Muslims in Zhourao, not just within the borders of Zhusha. Recently the Weizhou affair where a Muslim boy was kidnapped by a Christian missionary has created resentment against Mianjin not seen in decades, with many scholars proclaiming that a fatwa should sanction jihad against Mianjin. Sultan Suleiman has heard the arguments of the muftis but has yet to make an official statement. The apparent neutrality of the Sultanate has been the official policy for decades, and threatening Mianjin directly could lead to war and worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO39.A;Let the Shaykh Ul Islam issue a fatwa, Mianjin has grown decadent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO39.B;Censor the Muftis. This matter is more delicate than they realize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO40.T;A Fatwa from Zhusha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO40.D;The High Mufti of Butingshan has issued a fatwa against us following the Augustinian affair : ”O beloved Moslems, consider even though but for a brief moment, the present condition of the Islamic world. For if you consider this but a little, you will weep long. Wherever you look you see the enemies of the true religion, particularly in Mianjin where infidels kidnap Muslim boys to make them apostates. This tyranny has passed all endurable limits ; the cup of our oppression is full to overflowing. The holy war has now become a sacred duty. Know ye that the blood of infidels in the Islamic lands may be shed with impunity - except those to whom the Moslem power has promised security and who are allied with it. The time has come that we should rise up as the rising of one man, in one hand a sword, in the other a gun, in his pockets balls of fire and death-dealing missiles, and in his heart the light of the faith.” Despite our censorship of the text, we already have signs of the Muslim community within our land rebelling against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO40.A;Our good Muslim brothers will not listen to the Sultan, surely…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO41.T;The Second Kongsi War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO41.D;In 1825, the Kongsi War came to an end and we found Mianjin divided by the traitorous League of Yaluo. From that day forward we have always known that this situation could not last. The years since the end of the war have seen impressive leaps in military modernization - gone are the days of armies of spearmen with only a few rifles between them. We have also resolved the situation with the Maori in Changyun, in one way or another, allowing us to focus our attention upon the mainland. Most importantly we are now aware of just how much attention Scandinavia and the other Great Powers of Europe are paying to the continent of Zhourao these days. If we do not unify Zhourao then they will surely devour us! This morning a Yaluese border patrol was caught on Mianjin soil. They blamed outdated maps but we know that they were scouting out an invasion route! We will not let them strike the first blow! The Assembly has already voted to declare war on the rebels and crush them once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO41.A;We shall pen the final chapter of this tale of division!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO42.T;The Second Kongsi War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO42.D;In 1825, the Kongsi War came to an end and we won our independence from the tyrannical patricians of the Mianjin Republic. Yet we always knew that they would never rest until they had taken their revenge, and so we have always stayed vigilant. Years have passed, our militaries growing more advanced as we prepared for the next round of conflict, and now the patricians have decided to strike. This morning one of our border patrols in the northwestern wilds was taken captive by a Mianjin battalion who alleged that they trespassed into Mianjin lands. Despite our protests that the land in question was uninhabited and that no demarcation of the area had ever been made, the arrogant Mianjin have seized upon the matter as an excuse to declare war. Now we must once again stand up and fight for our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO42.A;Let our glory be blazed into the eternal heavens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO43.T;Intervention in Second Kongsi War?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO43.D;As it was some twenty years ago, the kongsi republics of Mianjin and Yaluo are once again at war. We have no love for either group, but should one of them decisively prevail over the other, then they shall surely turn their gaze northwards upon us and attempt to unify all of Zhourao by force. Therefore, it might be prudent for us to strike south while they are still occupied with their own struggle. This is our chance to claim Zhourao for the ummah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO43.A;We shall ride forth for a glorious ghazw against the infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO43.B;Let them shed their own blood in their squabbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO44.T;The Red Sultan Attacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO44.D;The Sultanate of Zhusha has sought to unite Zhourao under their rule ever since Ma Zicheng and the Sufi orders led their people into rebellion. For a time it seemed that they had turned their attention inwards. Now we know that this was merely their own way of biding time. The armies of the Red Sultan have been spotted approaching from the north, and he has announced his intention to defeat both Mianjin and Yaluo to unite Zhourao beneath his own banner in the name of Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO44.A;We shall cut them down like a scythe unto wheat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO45.T;Mediate the Second Kongsi War?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO45.D;Southwestern Australie has been ravaged by war between the rival kongsi republics of Mianjin and Yaluo for the second time in decades. While both powers have exhausted themselves, there has been no resolution to their conflict. Now the governor of Vargø has proposed to offer mediation between the two powers, seeing as though a border dispute between an undefined section of their frontier was one of the incidents which sparked the war. He also proposes that, in the interests of preserving peace in the region and establishing a neutral zone for trade and political affairs amongst the Chinese Australiens, the port city of Xinxiang should be placed under Scandinavian protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO45.A;We endorse this logical proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO46.T;Scandinavia’s Veiled Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO46.D;The stalemate between the nations of Zhourao has invited Scandinavian interference, as we always feared that it would. The Scandinavian representative recently presented a “proposal” to our government to mediate outstanding issues with our neighbors, including the demarcation of our borders. In addition to this, he had the impertinence to “suggest” that Xinxiang be placed under Scandinavian control to ensure its neutrality! This is an absurd and insulting idea, but it is far more than an offer - it is a demand, backed by the Scandinavian military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO46.A;We have no choice but to relinquish Xinxiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO46.B;We have no need of your false and barbarous peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO47.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO47.D;We have been unable to convince $FROMCOUNTRY$ to allow us to open up negotiations with their neighbors and to place Xinxiang beneath our protection. If we wish to ensure the stability of Australie going forwards then we have no choice but to compel them to comply by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO47.A;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO48.T;Scandinavia Demands Weizhou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO48.D;Scandinavia has coveted our lands ever since they first established their Vargø colony. We have done our best to keep them at arm’s reach by confining their merchants to the city of Weizhou, but the increasing tensions across Zhourao have only worsened their greed. Now the Scandinavian ambassador has come before us with a ridiculous story that several Scandinavian businessmen have lost “almost all” of their recent shipments into Weizhou, and they blame the corruption of our officials for this. In all likelihood these men were engaged in black market business elsewhere in Mianjin and are now trying to write off their sales. The truly shocking part was that Scandinavia sees this as evidence that Weizhou must be leased to them in order to supervise the city’s trade! As Weizhou is our main business center, this would sign our nation’s whole economy into Nordic hands, placing our independence in doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO48.A;Absolutely not! We shall defend our freedom to the death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO48.B;War would be futile…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO49.T;The Sun’s Presence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO49.D;"The Rising Sun has finally graced us." - Ma Luozi\nAs Japan's presence in the Pacific has intensified, so has its trade. Its merchant fleet has been a mainstay across Asia throughout the centuries, waning or growing in rivalry with Qingqiu. Zhusha, however, had managed to escape this gaze for such a time, as Qingqiuese traders were given preferential treatment, then the Anglois and other Europeans. But as the Japanese once more set their sights outwards, we are finding a significant amount of the Land of the Rising Sun’s products and goods in our country as their traders head south. Though much of it has come in the shape of artisanal and industrial works, a great enthusiasm has been found for Japanese literature amongst our elite. Crown Prince Ma Luozi himself has become fascinated with Japanese culture, to the point that his public obsession had been touched upon by critics as a soft foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO49.A;His obsession with Rìben will eventually pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO50.T;The Sun’s Welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO50.D;"Japan has no allies in the Pacific, only ambitions..." - An unnamed Japanese bureaucrat\nSince the beginning of the 19th century, the waning influence of the merchant fleet has been a cause of concern, forcing us into a period of isolation under the regency. However, since its end, the merchant fleet has returned to the corners of the Pacific. Yet we have found our former ports in calling with new owners, or new partners, turning their backs on us and relying upon the Europeans instead. Thus we have sought out a new zone of interest that was previously unobtainable due to Qingqiu favouritism : the Sultanate of Zhusha. In this far-flung land, a series of successful trades has lead to their young, and impressionable crown prince, Ma Luozi to take a fancy with our culture. His voice is an important one, as early surveys have shown that Zhushan's resources are nowhere close to running out, and with the Pacific acting as a chessboard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO50.A;Zhusha might just be the missing piece in our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO51.T;Death of the Red Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO51.D;Sultan Suleiman, known privately as Ma Wong, has passed. While not as universally acclaimed as some of his predecessors he was still the central pillar of our nation, and the people of Zhusha are united in their mourning. Alas not even his family can spare too much time for grieving, as the succession is still in doubt. The shrewd Crown Prince Ma Luozi was always Suleiman’s favorite son, but he is a reserved and even austere young man - not to mention his love of Japanese culture, an awkward choice in a court mostly aligned with the Anglois. On that note his brother Prince Ma Fushou is a passionate artist and musician but one with little regard for politics, and who regularly commissions artwork from Paris. We have also discovered that the Songyan, a republican secret society (named after a traditional Chinese medicine) supported by Mianjin in the past, has returned, with posters reading “Red Sultans are the disease, we are the medicine” once again appearing in the alleys of Butingshan. Each faction will surely seek outside help…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO51.A;Suleiman, know rest in Jannah, for the Earth is in disorder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO52.T;Death of the Red Sultan of Zhusha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO52.D;Sultan Suleiman of Zhusha, known privately as Ma Wong, has passed. Crown Prince Ma Luozi is of course the official heir, but many people see his patience and dedication as austerity, and he is less charismatic than his younger brother Prince Ma Fushou. Prince Fushou is an artist but lacks any real appreciation for politics and thus is the favored choice of the Anglois to succeed his father, as they judge that he would make a good puppet. There are also rumors that the Songyan republican secret society has returned from the shadows, seeking to overthrow the sultanate and unite with the kongsi republics of the south. Now Crown Prince Luozi is seeking our assistance - political and military - to secure the throne against both his brother (and by extension the Anglois) and the Songyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO52.A;Any friend of Japan is a friend of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO52.A;We are flattered, but we cannot commit to such things at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO53.T;Death of the Red Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO53.D;Sultan Suleiman of Zhusha, known privately as Ma Wong, has passed. Crown Prince Ma Luozi is the official heir, but he is an austere and distant young man who, less charismatic than his younger brother Prince Ma Fushou. Prince Fushou is an artistic soul who both speaks fluent Anglois and has written poetry in it, and regularly commissions paintings from Paris, but who also has little appreciation for politics. Therefore if we could maneuver him onto the throne, he would protect our interests. This is especially true given that Crown Prince Luozi much prefers Japanese culture and is rumored to be courting Japan’s support for his candidacy with an eye towards reducing our own influence in Zhusha. Other rumors suggest that the Songyan republican secret society has reemerged, seeking to overthrow the sultanate and unite with the kongsi republics of the south. Supporting Fushou would mean promising military support in the event of conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO53.A;We must support Prince Ma Fushou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO53.B;Do not entangle us with these matters of succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO54.T;Death of the Red Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO54.D;"Red Sultans are the disease, we are the medicine," has been a common slogan within the Sultanate of Zhusha recently. This slogan comes from the name of a Republican secret society, the Songyan society, whose name is also a traditional Chinese medicine. Ever since Ma Zicheng’s rebellion over a century ago, kongsi republicans have sponsored these men fighting against the tyranny of the Ma Dynasty. Now Sultan Suleiman, privately known as Ma Wong, has died, and two of his sons are struggling for the throne, one backed by the Anglois and the other by the Japanese. This has given the Songyan a chance to move back out into the open on a scale unseen in over fifty years. Thus their agents have approached us in secret to ask for our support in an upcoming coup d’etat by the Songyan to reunite Zhusha with Zhourao. Accepting would pledge our aid should either the Anglois or the Japanese seek to restore the monarchy under their preferred ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO54.A;The country must unite, I tell you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO54.B;We cannot risk war with foreign empires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO55.T;Japan Supports Crown Prince Ma Luozi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO55.D;As we feared, the Japanese managed to spirit Crown Prince Ma Luozi and his wife and children out of Zhusha before the Songyan could apprehend him. Japan has now openly announced their support for Crown Prince Luozi to be restored to the throne of Zhusha and refused to recognize our annexation of the sultanate. Several members of the Ma Dynasty have also fled with their supporters and it is not unthinkable that Japan might be able to restore their rule by force, but without foreign support the Ma will all eventually be forced to give up. Thus pacifist members of the Assembly have proposed offering economic concessions to the Japanese in exchange for ceasing to support Crown Prince Luozi’s claim. Of course there is no guarantee that they will accept…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO55.A;Better peace today than war tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO55.B;Zhourao's sovereignty will not be infringed upon by the Japanese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO56.T;Songyan Coup D’Etat in Zhusha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO56.D;The Songyan managed to build enough popular support amongst the people and the Zhushan military to stage a pan-Zhourao republican revolution, forcing many members of the Ma Dynasty to flee either overseas or into the wilderness to escape capture. Our agents were able to spirit Crown Prince Ma Luozi and his wife and children out of the country before they could be caught by the rebels. Zhourao however has already proclaimed the annexation of Zhusha! We have received a message from their ambassador stating that while they will not restore the Sultanate they are willing to offer us significant trading rights within their nation if we cease our official support for Crown Prince Luozi’s claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO56.A;We must accept their terms in recognition of this fait accompli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO58.A;Let us all fight and work so that the invaders may perish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO59.T;The Treaty of Butingshan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO59.D;With Japan’s victory in the war, they have convened a diplomatic meeting in Butingshan to impose a peace treaty upon us.

ZHO66.A;It had to be this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO67.T;The Zhusha Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO67.D;The worst-case scenario has occurred. Despite the successful execution of a pan-Zhourao republican coup by the Songyan and their sympathizers in the Zhushan military, both Crown Prince Ma Luozi and Prince Ma Fushou, along with their wives and children, have been rescued by the Japanese and the Anglois respectively. Both nations are now demanding the restoration of their preferred candidate for the throne and threatening war if their demands are not met. Our head of state has met with his cabinet to discuss how to resolve this crisis. The economics minister has suggested that we organize a conference over free trade in the Torres strait to rope both empires into a diplomatic agreement with us and try to defuse tensions. The foreign minister has stated that the Anglois might be willing to back down if we drop our claim to their Chougie colony…at least for now. Our heads of the army and navy insist that we are perfectly capable of fending both empires off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO67.A;Propose the conference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO67.B;Seek an agreement with the Anglois so we can focus on Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO67.C;We shall not make any concessions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO68.T;Zhourao Proposes a Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO68.D;With both Japan and ourselves pressing claimants to the Zhushan throne, Zhourao has instead proposed to convene a conference between all three nations in the northern Australien city of Bozhou to secure a free trade agreement for the Torres Strait. They wish to demonstrate that they do not seek aggressive expansion in the region at the expense of any other party and that they shall respect both Anglois and Japanese interests. This would of course be a far poorer prize than Zhusha itself but it would avoid war and could allow us to increase our influence within Zhourao itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO68.A;Very well, let us salvage what we can from this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO68.B;Zhusha will be restored by force if necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO70.T;The Treaty of Bozhou;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO70.D;The Songyan republican secret society’s pan-Zhourao coup d’etat in Zhusha sent both Crown Prince Ma Luozi and Prince Ma Fushou running into the arms of the Japanese and the Anglois, respectively, and for a time it seemed as though a war would erupt between all three powers. Cooler heads have, thankfully, prevailed. Today representatives from these nations convened in the northern Zhourao city of Bozhou to sign a convention on free trade in the Torres Strait. There they have agreed to allow their merchants access to one another’s territory and to henceforth coordinate on strategic developments in the region. It remains to be seen if this treaty will withstand the ravages of time, but peace - at least in this corner of the world - has been preserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO70.A;And Zhourao, long divided, has united at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO71.T;The War of the Zhushan Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO71.D;The Songyan republican secret society’s pan-Zhourao coup d’etat in Zhusha sent both Crown Prince Ma Luozi and Prince Ma Fushou running into the arms of the Japanese and the Anglois, respectively. Zhourao attempted to prevent war by convening a conference in the northern Zhourao city of Bozhou to sign a convention on free trade in the Torres Strait. However the powers involved dismissed this overture, deeming it to be a mere ruse. War has now broken out at the edge of the world and the only remaining question is how many other powers may be drawn into the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO71.A;We shall strive for freedom as we strove for peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO72.T;A Chougie Agreement with Zhourao?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO72.D;Zhourao has approached us and made an offer to resolve tensions in Zhusha. In exchange for dropping our support for Prince Ma Fushou, they will drop any territorial claims to our Chougie colony. This would allow them to focus their full attention upon defending against Japan. As a government which ostensibly claims the entire continent of Australie, Zhourao covets our lands in the north of the continent, and the security which such a compromise would bring is not to be scoffed at. All the same, our more cynical ministers have reminded us that if Zhourao reaches a point in the future where they feel strong enough to challenge us directly, then they might abrogate the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO72.A;Accept the agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO71.B;We must decline, let them deal with Japan on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO71.C;We will restore Zhusha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO73.T;The Chougie Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO73.D;The Anglois have accepted our offer to waive our claim to Chougie in exchange for ceasing their support for Ma Fushou’s claim to the Zhushan throne. While this is an unpopular move, it allows us to focus the full force of our energy upon Japan. While we have sworn to honor all provisions of the agreement going forward, we cannot predict what the future may bring, and it is not impossible to imagine a scenario in which we may become powerful enough to declare the agreement null and void…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO73.A;For now, we must concentrate upon defeating Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO74.T;The Anglois and the Zhourao Have Signed a Treaty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO74.D;Zhourao was far more cunning than even we had expected. In order to eliminate the threat of an Anglois invasion, they have surrendered their own claim to the northern section of their continent in exchange for $FROMCOUNTRY$ ending their support for Prince Ma Fushou! This means that we will face Zhourao without its attention being divided by the Europeans. We may want to reconsider if a war to restore Zhusha is worth the effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO74.A;We must accept this new order…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO74.B;We will restore Zhusha, the Anglois be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO75.T;Failure of the Chougie Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO75.D;Zhourao had attempted to convince $FROMCOUNTRY$ to drop their support for Prince Ma Fushou in exchange for waiving their own claim to the Anglois Chougie colony. But the Anglois rejected such an overture, and now Zhourao must face us. That is, if we still believe that a war to restore the Sultanate of Zhusha is worth the effort. If Zhourao is this desperate to preserve their territorial integrity then perhaps we should focus on exerting diplomatic and economic pressure upon them instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO75.A;That may indeed be the more prudent course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO75.B;Ridiculous! We shall restore Zhusha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO76.T;Japan Refuses to Back Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO76.D;With the outbreak of war against Zhourao, we had hoped that Japan might withdraw from the situation. This has not occurred and Japan seems more resolved than ever to place Crown Prince Ma Luozi on the throne of Zhusha. Thus we are left with no choice but to declare war upon Japan as well to keep them out of Zhourao and thwart their intentions. §RIf Japan is able to enforce a treaty upon Zhourao before we can do the same then we will be forced to abide by it.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO76.A;They will pay the price of their impertinence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO77.T;The Enthronement of Suleiman II;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO77.D;Rumors of a Songyan conspiracy were true - we have recently captured or executed dozens of plotters who sought to orchestrate a republican coup d’etat to unite our nation with Zhourao! WIth that threat dealt with, Prince Ma Fushou was solemnly executed for his role in the conspiracy to claim the throne. In a grand ceremony, Crown Prince Ma Luozi was enthroned as Sultan Suleiman II! The event drew attendees from across Zhourao and the surrounding region, including a delegation from the Japanese Navy led by a relative of their head of state. In fact the Japanese have become a regular fixture of both the royal court and our communities. Some are concerned by this development but the Sultan could not be happier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO77.A;Long live Suleiman II!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO78.T;The Enthronement of Suleiman II, Sultan of Zhusha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO78.D;The last ringleaders of the Songyan secret society have been either captured or killed while resisting arrest. WIth that threat dealt with, Prince Ma Fushou was solemnly executed for his role in the conspiracy to claim the throne. In a grand ceremony, Crown Prince Ma Luozi was enthroned as Sultan Suleiman II! A delegation from the Japanese Navy was one of many guests at the event. In fact our citizens have become a regular fixture of both the Zhushan royal court and its communities. Several Japanese businessmen have moved their families to Zhusha to be closer to them, and the expatriate community continues to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO79.D;Rumors of a Songyan conspiracy were true - we have recently captured or executed dozens of plotters who sought to orchestrate a republican coup d’etat to unite our nation with Zhourao! Crown Prince Ma Luozi attempted to launch an insurrection of his own and perished during the fighting. In a grand ceremony, Prince Ma Fushou was enthroned as Sultan Muhammad III! The event drew attendees from across Zhourao and the surrounding region, including a delegation from the Anglois Navy led by a famous admiral. In fact the Anglois have become a regular fixture of both the royal court and our communities. Some are concerned by this development but the Sultan could not be happier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO80.T;The Enthronement of Sultan Muhammad III, Sultan of Zhusha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO81.T;The Crisis of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO81.D;Rumors of a Songyan conspiracy turned out to be false - while a few hardcore republican agitators have been arrested, we have found no evidence of an organized plot against the monarchy itself. However, that by no means has secured our stability. While Crown Prince Ma Luozi has indeed ascended to the throne as Sultan Suleiman II in a grand ceremony - attended by, among others, a delegation from the Japanese Navy - Prince Ma Fushou and his wife and children fled Zhusha the night of the festivities! We believe that they have taken refuge with the Anglois, who may seek to contest Suleiman II’s rule. If that happens then war may be the result, though the Japanese have assured us that they will protect us if it comes to that point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO81.A;Long live Suleiman II, and may Allah grant him strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO82.T;The Zhushan Succession Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO82.D;Crown Prince Ma Luozi of Zhusha has rooted out the Songyan secret society and been enthroned as Sultan Suleiman II. However Prince Ma Fushou and his wife and children have been successfully escorted into Anglois territory before his brother could act against him. We now must consider whether we wish to mount a military campaign to support Prince Fushou’s claim to the throne. The Japanese have made it clear that they will use their own military to defend against any attempt to oust Suleiman II. We must contemplate as to whether our military is prepared for a full-scale war in the Far East, or whether it might be more prudent to simply grant Prince Fushou and his family asylum in Paris and recognize Suleiman II’s rule to restore relations with both Zhusha and Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO82.A;Prince Fushou is and shall be the rightful Sultan of Zhusha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO82.B;We shall recognize Sultan Suleiman II for the sake of diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO83.T;The War of the Zhushan Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO83.D;As we feared, the Anglois have declared Prince Ma Fushou to be the legitimate sultan of Zhusha, and are preparing to launch a military campaign against Zhusha to overthrow Sultan Suleiman II. If we wish to preserve our newfound influence within the sultanate, then we must defend the sultan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO83.A;We stand at the ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO84.T;The Anglois Back Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO84.D;As expected, the cowardly Anglois had no stomach for entertaining the idea that Prince Ma Fushou was in any way the rightful sultan of Zhusha. They have offered his family asylum in Paris but nothing further. Sultan Suleiman II’s reign may now proceed, and our influence within Zhusha has been confirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO84.A;The Anglois have shown unexpected wisdom by not challenging us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO85.T;The Enthronement of Sultan Suleiman II;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO85.D;Rumors of a Songyan conspiracy turned out to be false - while a few hardcore republican agitators have been arrested, we have found little evidence of an organized plot against the monarchy itself. In a grand ceremony, Crown Prince Ma Luozi was enthroned as Sultan Suleiman II! The event drew attendees from across Zhourao and the surrounding region, as well as representatives from multiple Indian realms. While the new Sultan was disappointed that the Japanese sent only a single naval officer to represent their nation at the ceremony, he has otherwise taken to governance with great aplomb, already planning new reforms to further expand our administration, our economy, and our cultural presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO85.A;Long Live Suleiman II!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO86.T;The Final Reunion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO86.D;For the first time since 1740 by the European calendar, unity has been restored to Zhourao ; for the first time ever, we have truly become one nation. The Songyan coup within Zhusha went off without any issues, with the Ma Dynasty forced to abandon all claims to the Zhusha Sultanate and go into exile in exchange for their lives. While the Hui may take time to accept this new state of affairs, restorationist sympathy for the Zhushan Sultanate has largely been washed away by the tide of pan-Zhourao nationalism. With the slate of our continent wiped clean through our exertions, the time has come to go forth and write not merely a new chapter, but a whole new history - the history of the nation of Zhourao!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO86.A;Zhourao, long divided, has united at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO87.T;Trouble in Sophia with the Black Flag Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO87.D;Our settlement of Sophia in Australie has encountered trouble. It began with skirmishes between settlers and the local Kaurna tribe. The situation escalated when a Yaluese-Aboriginal mercenary named Wong Yongfu (who bears a grudge against us due to his ancestors being killed during the settler wars in Vargø) led a force of around 100 bandits into the western frontier to escape prosecution. They quickly befriended the Kaurna tribe by marrying into it and assisting it against its regional rivals. The result has been the effective merge of the tribe and Wong’s men, which he calls the Black Flag Army after his own personal standard. Under Wong’s instruction, the tribe’s skill with guerilla warfare has increased with frightening speed. Wong has even begun to levy taxes in the region! The resulting profit is attracting adventurers from Spain to Qingqiu. If this situation is not resolved then the Black Flags could soon pose an existential threat to the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO87.A;We must remain vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO88.T;The Black Flag Army Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO88.D;The governor of Sophia in Zhourao has received a warning from the bandits who harass our settlements : "The valiant warrior Wong Yongfu, general of the Kaurnas to the Scandinavian bandits : Everyone knows you are thieves. Other nations despise you. You claim that you have come to trade, but in fact you are plotting to take over the country. Ever since you came to Zhourao, your crimes are as numerous as the hairs on the head. The inhabitants have been reduced to misery, and the country is nearly ruined. God and man both loathe you. I am making this proclamation : You Scandinavian bandits, if you think you are strong enough, send your rabble of soldiers to Zhuoxi to fight in the open field with my warriors protected by the Rainbow Serpent, and then we will see who is the strongest. If you are afraid to come, cut off the heads of your chief, and I will let you miserable ants live. But if you delay, my army will take your city and kill you all. Life is but a step away from death. Mark my words well.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO88.A;Tell General Vilhelm Elversten of Vargø to end this charade at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO89.T;The Massacre of Elversten’s Army;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO89.D;We had dispatched an expeditionary force under General Vilhelm Elversten to rout the bandits plaguing Sophia and bring Wong Yongfu to justice. We assumed that Wong had little knowledge of real military tactics. This was incorrect. Wong harried our men as soon as they left the outskirts of Sophia, his army seeming to melt into the landscape. When the Black Flag Army finally emerged they outnumbered our own men by almost two to one and after a fierce struggle Elversten was forced to surrender. Wong demanded that our army return to Sophia and evacuate the settlement, promising safe passage for Elversten’s men. However during the return to Sophia the Black Flags launched even more attacks and seized the town before our men could arrive. Out of 500 Scandinavian soldiers, only a single European (Army Surgeon Gunter Kyhn) and a few Australien auxiliaries escaped back to Vargø. The Kaurna tribe has petitioned Zhourao for annexation and they named Wong as the new governor. Kyhn believes that Wong was a Zhourao agent all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO89.A;This colony was doomed from the very beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO89.B;We shall scourge Zhourao and bring Wong here in chains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO90.T;Victory of the Black Flag Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO90.D;Our gambit of supporting the Black Flag Army has paid off. Wong’s men led the Scandinavian expeditionary force sent to crush them in a long chase into the wilds, before surrounding them and then chasing them back to Sophia, where they then waited for the settlers to withdraw from the town before descending upon them. The settlement has now been seized and the Kaurna tribe have petitioned for our annexation, allowing us to claim the region, while Scandinavia has written the colony off as a lost cause. It was feared that Wong might turn his newly enriched Black Flags upon us, but we have awarded Wong and his top men with official military ranks and medals for their actions - combined with his new role as governor of Penghu, this seems to have mollified Wong. The officers have rankled at this honor heaped upon a former criminal, yet Wong has become something of a folk hero both locally and nationally, with stories inflating the deeds of the Black Flag Army to mythical proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO90.A;Risks do have their rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO91.T;The Penghu Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO91.D;Our gambit of supporting the Black Flag Army has paid off - in a way. Wong’s men led the Scandinavian expeditionary force sent to crush them in a long chase into the wilds, before capturing and pretending to release the Europeans only to descend upon and slaughter the army as they withdrew. The settlement has now been seized and the Kaurna tribe have petitioned for our annexation, allowing us to claim the region. However Scandinavia has furiously denounced us as aiding and abetting a murderous criminal, and have declared war with the intention of both restoring Sophia and bringing Wong to justice. Wong in turn has had the audacity to send a letter to the capital demanding to be given a generalship! Given that the alternative could be Wong inciting a revolt in the frontier we cannot exactly refuse. However while he is a greedy and underhanded man he has sworn “utter loyalty” to “the representatives of the people of Zhourao” and both his military skill and his now-legendary reputation are beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO92.T;The End of the Black Flag Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO92.D;The Black Flag Army was eventually pursued to a fortified cave system on the edge of the Yaluo border. They fought ferociously - in one day Elversten lost more men than in all previous engagements put together. Wong then attacked at night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. He lost so many men in this counterattack that he was obliged to withdraw into a fortified perimeter. After resting his troops, Elversten resumed the attack two days later. To hearten his troops, he personally led his men forward to a position well within range of the Black Flags. At 5 p.m. our forces captured the western entrance to the main chamber and fought their way inside. Wong's men made for a hidden exit, but were caught when one of them accidentally knocked down a stalactite, alerting our forces who finished them off in furious close-quarters fighting. In the morning our soldiers stitched together an enormous Scandinavian flag from strips of cloth torn from captured Black Flag banners and hoisted it from a tree at the cave’s mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO98.T;The Hakka of Xinxiang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO98.D;In the 19th century, increasing turmoil within China caused many Chinese people to emigrate. This was accelerated by Qingqiuan and Zhourao corporations using hiring agencies to recruit immigrants, and whose “credit-ticket” system allowed Chinese migrants to pay back their ticket after arrival. Mianjin formed a Ministry of Immigration whose first role was to support this process. These immigrants became ensnared within local kongsi politics, as organizations from China were transplanted into Zhourao. Most early arrivals were Hakka from Fujian and Guangdong. The Hakka (whose name literally means “guest family,” a relic of their immigration within China) had migrated many times over the centuries, giving rise to the saying, “Wherever there is sunshine, there are Chinese : wherever there are Chinese, there are Hakka.” Many were directed to help rebuild Xinxiang, a frequent site of Mianjinese-Yaluese battles. As in their homeland, Hakka were often stereotyped as criminals. Despite this they went on to found many businesses within Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO98.A;All Chinese are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO102.T;The Yue of the Riverina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO102.D;The Yue people (erroneously known as “Cantonese” people by Europeans, a term that more accurately refers to Han people from the greater Guangzhou, or Canton, area) were the next major wave of Chinese immigration. Originating from the Zhujiang (Pearl) River basin in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Yue, along with the Hakka, have historically comprised the vast majority of overseas Chinese. Owing to the emerging policy of directing immigrants to areas similar to their original environments in the hopes that their work skills would be more easily transferable, many Yue who arrived in Zhourao were directed to the Yongding River basin to build and expand its infrastructure. These Yue immigrants often came into conflict with both older Zhourao communities and more recent Hakka migrants. Guangdong’s relative wealth compared to other Chinese regions meant that most Yue who emigrated were poor, inspiring considerable disdain by Zhourao locals. Despite this they went on to invent many advances in marine and engineering science in Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO102.A;All Chinese are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO105.T;The Min of the Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO105.D;The Min people were the next major wave of immigrants from China. Originating from Fujian, the Min had spread across the coast of the southern Chinese mainland and Taiwan by the 19th century. As many Min hailed from mountainous and forested regions, the Ministry of Immigration provided financial incentives for mining and forestry corporations to settle the Min in similar areas. While this expanded previously remote communities, the isolation it created - compounded by Min Chinese’s archaic sound and vocabulary due to its unusually high amount of surviving Old Chinese influence - caused Min immigrants within Zhourao to be stereotyped as backwards and ignorant. Despite this, they gained a reputation for resilience and technological ingenuity. Several of Zhourao’s first socialist and progressive leaders were of Min heritage, and some of the most significant battles (figurative and literal) of the early Zhourao labor movement were fought against the onerous influence of mining and forestry corporations within Min communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO105.A;All Chinese are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO108.T;The Han of the Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO108.D;The Han people were the final major wave of immigration from China before the mid-20th century. While strictly speaking the Han, like all other Chinese peoples, were and are not monolithic, the need for the different Chinese successor states to have a single language to communicate with led to the growth of Mandarin Chinese as the prestige language of China and thus of the Han, its largest group. Compared to other, earlier Chinese migrants who tended to come from rural southeastern communities, most of these Han migrants came from the north, fleeing overcrowding and economic exploitation. They were often more skilled than prior Chinese arrivals, allowing them to compete for more prestigious and higher-paying jobs in Zhourao, while also drawing them to urban centers where such talents were always in demand. This inspired great envy towards Han immigrants, who were stereotyped as vain and selfish. Despite this they became highly influential within Zhourao arts and academia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO108.A;All Chinese are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO109.T;Failure in the Ny Sjaelland War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO109.D;We have been unable to protect the Maori from Mianjin. While the Admiralty insists that they can still liberate the islands, our head of state and his cabinet have decided to sue for peace. The resulting treaty has left Ny Sjaelland once again in Mianjin’s hands. Perhaps we should count ourselves fortunate that they did not attempt to seize Vargø…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO109.A;What a debacle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO110.T;Aftermath of the Maori Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO110.D;Our defeat of Tapua Te Rauangaanga has caused a political reckoning within Mianjin. More and more people believe that it is imperative the office of the Chairman of the Assembly be allowed a greater amount of powers going forwards. After all, his supporters say, was it not Chairman Liu who mobilized the military to Changyun to defeat the Maori insurrection, while the Assembly was still paralyzed by indecision? This is still a controversial view, but far less controversial than it was before the rebellion. As police operations continue across Changyun to put down the last remnants of Te Rauangaanga’s army, the notion of an empowered executive branch is gaining acceptance amongst the people of Mianjin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO110.A;And the Chairman sleeps more soundly than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO111.T;The Treaty of Yungang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO111.D;In a humiliating ceremony, our ministers met Te Arikinu Tapua Te Rauangaanga in Yungang, where we were forced to officially recognize the independence of the Kingdom of Aotearoa. The loss of Changyun to the Maori has only fueled the political controversy within the republic. Some argue that the defeat was due to unnecessary restrictions upon the Chairman of the Assembly, who was not able to obtain the right resources to end the rebellion. Others declare that it was precisely the high-handed conduct of Chairman Liu in the past which enabled the Maori rebellion, and that had the Assembly been able to restrain his actions, it may never have occurred. Suffice to say it seems that few lessons have been learned from this embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO111.A;What a blunder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO112.T;The Army Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO112.D;It is a shameful truth that the Mianjin Army is not much in comparison to those of the Europeans. While the zeal of our men cannot be doubted, their equipment and training have lagged behind. Most still use smoothbore muskets, bows and arrows, or even spears! Not to mention the fact that our fortifications have changed little over the centuries. Therefore the Assembly is now debating how best to modernize the army. Most representatives believe that the solution is simple : purchase enough rifles for the whole army and hire some Burgundian engineers to upgrade our forts. However, an influential general educated at the Burgundian Royal Military Academy of Anvers named Shi Dakai insists that, while the issues of technology will be naturally solved as we develop, we must establish a new standing army along European lines. The current Mianjin army is based on a small core of volunteers supported by the militia, a system designed to prevent the government (more specifically the Chairman) from using the army as a political weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO112.A;General Shi is right, we need a true army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO112.B;What we need now are new weapons and new forts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO113.T;The New Mianjin Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO113.D;The Mianjin Republic’s development over the last few years has made it clear that we must adapt in order to face the future. Mounting public pressure for reform has resulted in the adoption of a new constitution for the republic and the prestige of reunification has allowed Chairman Liu to enforce his vision on the new country of Zhourao. This document greatly increases the power of the executive, with the new position of President being split from the Chairman of the Assembly who shall henceforth take on a more ceremonial role. Liu Xishan has resigned as Chairman in order to assume the momentous obligation of being the first President of Zhourao! With his ascension, traditional ideas of kongsi governance are beginning to merge with more European, Arcadian, and Amerigan styles of republicanism, promoting greater centralization and opening the political sphere to our nation’s different religious communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO113.A;Hail to the chief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO114.T;The Removal of Chairman Liu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO114.D;Despite the victory over Yaluo, the growing national consensus is that the Mianjin Republic has not developed rapidly enough to either face the southerners or to adapt to our changing world. While there is a procedure to remove a Chairman of the Assembly from office, it has almost never been used - until now. Evidence has recently been brought forth that Chairman Liu allowed wealthy Christian citizens to “buy” government appointments via bribery. While the evidence itself is somewhat dubious, the Assembly has seized upon it to justify Liu’s removal from office. This morning Liu was officially impeached from his position as Chairman and has fled with his family to Qingqiu rather than face criminal prosecution for his actions. With Liu gone, the ideas of centralization and executive power that his followers supported have been increasingly rejected in favor of traditional kongsi governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO114.A;Business as usual, once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ZHO115.T;The Great Pacific War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO115.D;This morning a Zhourao flotilla infringed upon the waters near the coast of Okinawa, causing the local garrison to dispatch its torpedo boats to intercept them. Despite numerous exhortations by the garrison to withdraw, the Zhourao ships ignored all messages. They then fired an opening salvo at our boats! Our local commander naturally ordered them to retaliate in self-defense. Zhourao is now claiming that we attacked them, a ridiculous falsehood given their blatant aggression. Despite this, they have already issued an official declaration of war against us, and their rhetoric suggests that they seek nothing less than the destruction of Japan! Not since the days of the Mongol invasions over six hundred years ago has Japan been under such dire threat. All of our citizens, man and woman, rich and poor, young and old, must now stand up as one and fight for the fate of our homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO115.A;Death to the invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ZHO116.T;The Treaty of Qinghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO116.D;The initial surrender of Japan to Zhourao was signed between the highest military officials and foreign ministers of both nations on board the battleship ZNS Zheng He, anchored in the bay of Japan’s capital city. The official peace treaty, drafted and signed in the Zhourao city of Qinghui, has dismembered our overseas empire in totality. In accordance with the principles of self-determination, the national minorities formerly ruled by us have been allowed to either reunite with their homelands or to establish independent states under Zhourao’s protection. All Chinese-majority territories and several Pacific islands have been directly annexed to Zhourao. By far the most shocking provision was the establishment of a sectarian Christian republic in Kyushu, where they only form a slim plurality of its population. Few people in Japan had anticipated the severity of this treaty and it will surely go down in history as the greatest defeat ever inflicted upon our nation. With the demolition of our empire, Zhourao has now become the undisputed hegemon of the western Pacific Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO118.T;The Zhourao Declaration of War against Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO118.D;”Yesterday - a day that will live in infamy - Zhourao was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval forces of the nation of Japan. Zhourao was at peace with that Nation. The ZNS Nanshan and other ships, while conducting a training mission, were attacked by a number of hostile Japanese vessels with torpedoes. This act of aggression brings home to all of us in Zhourao the importance of peace and security in Asia. Japanese aggression by terror against the peaceful villagers of China has now been joined by open aggression on the high seas against Zhourao. I have been informed that attacks upon Zhourao territory by Japan are now expected. No matter how long it may take, the Zhourao people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. With confidence in our armed forces - with the unbounding determination of our people - we will gain the inevitable triumph - so help us God. I ask that the Assembly declare that since these unprovoked and dastardly attacks, a state of war has existed between Zhourao and Japan.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO118.A;The ayes have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO119.T;Foundation of the Tongmenghui of Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO119.D;Secret societies have long been part of the Chinese world. The Songyan republicans of Zhusha were one of the oldest groups which originated in Zhourao rather than in China, though they have by now dissolved. Zhourao nationalist groups have existed underground for decades but most became occupied by feuding with one another. Now a charismatic pan-Zhourao nationalist named Dong Bufang has united various Zhourao revolutionary organizations under the banner of the Tongmenghui of Zhourao, or the Zhourao United League. The Zhourao Tongmenghui, modeled on but distinct from a similar organization in China, seeks to create a secular and unified Zhourao republic encompassing the whole continent. They are now publishing clandestine newspapers, and accumulating resources for an armed revolution to come. Their pursuit of Zhourao’s liberation through both political activism and militant struggle has begun to attract scores of followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZHO119.A;This may prove dangerous…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO121.T;The Zhourao Tongmenghui Enter $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO121.D;Dong Bufang’s Tongmenghui of Zhourao has begun to make inroads with the population of $PROVINCENAME$. Our colonial police believe that a regional center of the revolutionary society has been established somewhere within the community. Pan-Zhourao nationalist literature is now being found throughout the area, colonial armories have reported more than one recent theft, and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ expatriates are being treated with not just suspicion but contempt by the locals. More and more people are ceasing to describe themselves as “Mianjinese,” “Yaluese,” or “Zhushan,” in lieu of simply “Zhourao.” If the pace of this activity continues then our whole administration in the region could soon be compromised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO121.A;We must root out these criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO122.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Proposes to Purchase Sophia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO122.D;It is no secret that our Australien colony in Sophia is far less successful than Vargø. Both the distance from other Scandinavian territories and its geographical isolation from other Australien population centers in general have made Sophia struggle to survive, to say nothing of its difficulties with the natives. Now $FROM$ has seized upon Sophia’s difficulties and offered to purchase the colony. While it would be a mild embarrassment to admit our failure to settle southern Australie, this may be the best opportunity to secure a graceful exit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO122.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO122.B;Sophia is Scandinavian and that is final!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO123.T;Scandinavia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO125.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Proposes an Oceanien Colonial Exchange;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO125.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ holds multiple settlements in both Australie and Insulinde, which has caused friction with our own holdings in that same area. They have now proposed to exchange their eastern Insulinde colonies with our Margere settlement. While we had hoped to consolidate Margere into a larger colonial territory within Australie, so far this has been unsuccessful. The islands which they are proposing to trade are rich in natural resources, and could also yield important scientific discoveries due to their unexplored interiors. Furthermore this would give us a foothold in Nieu-Guinée.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO125.A;Very well, make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO125.B;We have better things in store for Margere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO127.T;Transportation to Nouvelle-Zélande;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO127.D;In the 1810s, the Burgundian government began to transport prisoners to penal colonies in Australie, mostly around the greater Port-Anne region. Convicts had previously been transported to Lotharingia, but this came to an end after the Lotharian Revolution. The end of the civil war and the resulting number of prisoners made Nouvelle-Zélande increasingly dominated by convict colonists. Initial convicts were usually Dutch but most arrivals to Port-Anne today are liberal and socialist agitators, given that keeping these men in the homeland presents a security risk. Of course there are those within the colonial office who believe that letting so many political opponents of the government make residence within Nouvelle-Zélande is itself a security risk. In fact some radicals have begun to settle in Nouvelle-Zélande of their own free will, as the local colonial government has a reputation for political apathy in contrast to the metropole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO131.T;Failure of European Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO131.D;Our recent gains from the European powers have inflamed racial and religious tensions across the nation. The European-descended members of our society are up in arms at our conquests, and feel that the government has violated the social contract which previously underpinned our nation’s ethnic harmony. While the other elements of our citizenry have yet to mobilize in support of the Europeans’ protests, it is clear that our mandate to rule over the white sections of our society may have been irreversibly lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO131.A;But, I thought that would be welcomed as liberators…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO134.T;Growth of Radicalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
ZHO134.D;Our absorption of the southern kongsi republics, as well as the increase in of foreign literature within our society due to international trade, has also circulated republican ideas. Zhourao intellectuals object to the monarchy’s monopoly of power and the suppression of the Mianjin and Yaluo Zongtings, while Islamic reformers decry the subservience of the national ulema to the royal throne. Various minor kongsi continue to agitate for a restoration of old democratic customs. All of this is placing mounting pressure upon the government to open up society - with many republicans willing to force the monarchy’s abolition if their demands are not met.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO135.D;The growth of democratic ideas within Zhourao has reached a fever pitch. Kongsi across the sultanate are now threatening to go on strike if a constitution is not adopted and a national Zongting is not established. Comments by loyalist mufti that republicanism may not be compatible with righteous Islamic governance have outraged the Mahayana Buddhists and Catholic Christians of the south, who have long held to democratic traditions albeit ones quite divergent from the European mode. Even Xinjiao reformists are now accusing the government of hoarding power and wealth, thus neglecting its own communities. If we do not take immediate action against the constitutionalists then an interfaith coalition could soon force drastic reforms upon the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ZHO137.T;Death of the Red Sultan of Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO137.D;Sultan Suleiman, known privately as Ma Wong, has passed. Lauded by the Hui as the unifier of Zhourao and the savior of the House of Islam upon the continent, all of Zhourao is united in their mourning. Yet the government must continue. In a grand ceremony, Crown Prince Ma Luozi was enthroned as Sultan Suleiman II! The event drew attendees from across Zhourao and the surrounding region, as well as representatives from multiple Indian realms. While the new Sultan was disappointed that the Japanese sent only a single naval officer to represent their nation at the ceremony, he has otherwise taken to governance with great aplomb, already planning new edicts to further expand our administration, our economy, and our cultural presence. However his autocratic nature has drawn criticism, with his younger brother Prince Ma Fushou displaying a rare level of initiative in publicly urging the new Sultan to protect the rights of the people and to heed the call of reform. But, Suleiman II may have other plans…;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO137.A;Long live Sultan Suleiman II!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO138.T;The $YEAR$ Bombardment of the Zongting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO138.D;Sultan Suleiman II, even before his enthronement, has long disdained the Zhourao Zongting. Like many Hui conservatives, he sees it as a disgraceful remnant of the corrupt kongsi republics as well as an entrance for Western imperialism. Now the political turmoil that has arisen in the aftermath of his father’s death has given him an excuse to crush Zhourao parliamentarianism. A group of liberal activists - many believed to have ties to the Songyan secret society once sponsored by Mianjin - broke into the Zongting last night and occupied it as a protest. Suleiman II responded by declaring an insurrection and ordered his elite personal guard, the Jenggi Brigade (composed of the descendants of East African slaves, which were seen as status symbols of the rich in Zhusha), to put down the “revolt.” The Jenggi shelled the Zongting and executed several constitutionalist leaders before plundering the building. Commander Umar Karume has been made military governor of the capital by the sultan, effectively imposing martial law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO138.A;Inshallah, we shall prevail over the rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO139.T;The Ousting of Sultan Suleiman II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO139.D;Sultan Suleiman II’s shelling of the Zongting and imposition of martial law have provoked a furious reaction. Liberals dispersed to sympathetic communities across the south, as well as old Songyan bases in the north. Within a week, two groups of reformists were marching towards the capital from opposite directions, recruiting volunteers as they went. At the head of the northern force was none other than Prince Ma Fushou! It seems that Suleiman II finally stirred him to suspend his artistic pursuits and seek to ride the rising wave of reformism. Some members of the Zhourao military aided the Jenggi Brigade in their defense of the capital but most either remained in their barracks or even joined the rebels. After a days-long battle through the capital, the revolutionaries have prevailed. Suleiman II sought shelter in the Japanese embassy and was dethroned and exiled to that nation along with his wife and children. Prince Ma Fushou has been enthroned as Sultan Muhammad III, promising to accept a new liberal constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO139.A;Long live Sultan Muhammad III!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO140.T;The consecration of the San Bao Plaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ZHO140.D;Crowds gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate the opening of the grand San Bao Plaza, named in honor of the title bestowed upon Zheng He by the Yongle Emperor. Located on a former small island in the capital’s harbor, known by the Eora as Dubbagullee, the governmental funds allowed the construction of an immense public plaza alongside the erection of a magnificent pagoda similar to the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing on the Western side, a mosque honoring the faith of the Eunuch on the Eastern Side and a 65 feet statue of the Discoverer of Zhourao, looking towards the seas for eternity at the northern point. A joyous crowd has taken part in the ceremony of dedication, with ambassadors from all nations having interest in the Pacific region, transforming the event into one of the great events of international news. But for many Zhourao, it also served as a great national occasion, as people from Zhusha, Mianjin and Yaluo gathered to honor the man who they all see as their venerable ancestor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However, a Vinlandic book has spread outrage in Zhourao : Haakon Bruks, renowned historian of China has publicly denied the idea that Zheng He discovered Zhourao, drawing upon historical sources to reconstitute the travels of the Treasure Fleets and heighten the differences between the European explorers and the Chinese maritime influence. ‘It saddens me to the see the Zhourao people be enraptured by the fairy tale of a discovery by the Treasure Fleets, which reminds me of the mythologization of Leif Erikson brought by our government, and which ends up forgetting the true ancestors of both Vinland and Zhourao’. So far, the book has not been rebuked by professional historians for it is a robust work, but already Zhourao journalists have called upon the government to demand an apology to this ‘Western imperialist’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Riverina_GAN_title;Develop the Yongding Banks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Riverina_GAN_desc;The Yongding River of southeastern Zhourao is the longest in the continent. While the lands surrounding it are verdant, the extreme variability of the river’s flow has historically left the region undeveloped. A group of engineers educated in European universities have now proposed to construct a series of locks, dams, and reservoirs that would aim to preserve fresh water for irrigation purposes for the greatest amount of the year possible. As the river normally floods in the winter and the spring and dries out in the summer and the autumn, this increase in irrigation would result in the Yongding river basin becoming a center of agricultural production and would likely attract many new settlers. A few scientists are concerned about the unpredictable effects of changing the natural flooding-drying cycle of the river but the potential benefits cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_black_flag_army_title;Sponsor the Black Flag Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_black_flag_army_desc;Years ago, a Zhourao-Hongshan Yalou mercenary named Wong Yongfu led around 200 bandits into the western frontier to escape prosecution. They befriended the local Kaurna tribe by marrying into it and assisting it against its rivals. The result has been the effective merge of the tribe and Wong’s men, which he calls the Black Flag Army after his own personal standard. He has been raiding the Scandinavian colony of Sophia, but now he is also trying to tax Zhourao caravans. We should instead secretly offer him amnesty and governorship of the region in exchange for him using his army to drive Scandinavia out. Wong might be a warlord but his ancestors fought against Scandinavia during their settlement of Vargø and he can hardly afford to betray the only power willing to support him. Of course he will likely demand proper equipment to wage a true war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

unite_zhourao_desc;What began as scattered trade outposts and various commercial endeavors has led to the settlement of all the eastern coast of the Zhourao continent by the descendants of the Middle Kingdom. Our peoples have drifted apart over the centuries, but that division must now come to an end. If we are to survive the challenges of the future - especially the increasing belligerence of Europe and Japan - then we must do so as one nation. Just as the peoples of the Yellow River valley joined forces to end the first Warring States period and to establish the Celestial Empire thousands of years ago, so too must we rise above our differences. The patricians from Mianjin, the Sultan of Zhusha and the democratic idealists of Yaluo have all dreamt of uniting Zhourao and now the Country, Long Divided, Must Unite at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

renegate_chougie_agreement_desc;In the past, we made an agreement with the Anglois to allow them to keep their Chougie colony in exchange for recognizing our claim to the rest of the continent. That agreement was founded upon the understanding that Anglois settlers would not trespass into our lands. Yet we continue to receive reports of the subjects of the Dual Monarchy entering our own frontier. The Anglois profess their ignorance of these events, but that is a lie! As is their accusation that our own citizens have done the same thing…In any case, if the Anglois will not respect the terms of the Chougie Agreement then there is no reason for us to respect it, either. We shall not rest until all corners of Zhourao fly a single flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCA_YLO_protectorate_desc;The League of Yaluo in southeastern Australie, off the coast of our Vargø colony, had always tried to hold us at arms’ reach. We sought to respect their customs, despite their tight regulations on Scandinavian trade, but their open aggression against Scandinavian citizens forced us to take control of Qingshui and install a Scandinavian resident to arbitrate Yaluese policies.

Now a group of Scandinavian businessmen have come forward and alleged that systematic corruption in the Weizhou port authority has resulted in the loss of most of their recent shipments. We can use this as evidence that Weizhou’s trade requires our own direct supervision.

zhusha_protectorate_DUA_title;The Zhushan Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
zhusha_protectorate_DUA_desc;Zhusha has been under our informal protection since the 1830s, but the tumultuous succession crisis surrounding the demise of Sultan Suleiman forced us to take a more active role. Our support of Prince Ma Fushou, now Sultan Muhammad III, was critical in preventing the Sultanate from falling into chaos, and nobody has forgotten the debt which he and his supporters owe to us - literally. The increase of colonial competition in Asia means that we can no longer rely on a friendly prince to protect our interests in Zhusha. A plan has been presented by a local colonial official to forgive all of Muhammad III’s financial debts to our nation in exchange for allowing an Anglois resident to be installed in the Zhushan capital. This will allow us to effectively control Zhushan by guiding its institutions into reliance on Anglois arbitration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

zhusha_protectorate_JAP_desc;Zhusha had long been known to the merchants of Japan, but the tumultuous succession crisis surrounding the demise of Sultan Suleiman brought it to our attention in a new way. Our support of Crown Prince Ma Luozi, now Sultan Suleiman II, was critical in preventing the Sultanate from falling into chaos, and nobody has forgotten the debt which he and his supporters owe to us - literally. The increased involvement of foreign empires in Asia means that we can no longer rely on a friendly prince to protect our interests in Zhusha. A plan has been presented by an influential Japanese admiral to forgive all of Suleiman II’s financial debts to our nation in exchange for allowing a Japanese resident to be installed in the Zhushan capital.

annex_the_zhusha_desc;The imposition of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ resident in Zhusha has unfortunately proved insufficient to properly defend our interests. Unrest continues to simmer across the nation, and its development has lagged behind. The ever-increasing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economic presence in Zhusha makes the untapped status of its many  resources all the more frustrating. Fortunately the advancement of communication technology in the years since Zhusha became our protectorate presents a solution. We will pressure the Sultan to sign a new treaty granting us the right to station our military anywhere in the Sultanate, and free economic conduct in all of its communities. It will also transfer almost all government responsibilities in Zhusha to our colonial officials, reducing the Sultan to a figurehead to legitimize our henceforth more direct rule in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
move_capital_xinxiang_title;Move our Capital to Xinxiang;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
move_capital_xinxiang_desc;Xinxiang, located on the southeastern coast, has two of the most valuable elements for a Zhourao city : a reliable supply of fresh water, and a deep harbor to handle ships of any size. Moreover, it is located at a roughly equidistant point between the main centers of settlement in eastern Zhourao, meaning that no one society will hold the advantage over the others by virtue of geography. Renovations will of course have to be made, in order to allow the city to become not merely the head of our bureaucracy and economy, but the cultural keystone of the Pacific. If we are giving the city a rebirth, then perhaps it deserves a new name as well…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_first_belt_title;Claim the First Belt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_first_belt_desc;The islands of Changyun, Cuiyan, and the Melanesian archipelago have enjoyed varying degrees of contact with Zhourao for generations. While we have always considered them within our cultural sphere we have always been too divided amongst ourselves to exercise any serious influence within the region. Now, however, we stand as one nation - and not a moment too soon, for the European powers as well as Japan and even Qingqiu are encroaching upon the southwestern Pacific. We cannot let these peoples be crushed under the weight of foreign colonialism! These islands must form the First Belt of Protection of Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The_Western_Belt_desc;We have conquered the lands of the Noongar people, extending our reach to the Indian ocean. However, some small islands lie a few hundred miles of our territory, and should they be acquired by an imperialist power, our western coast could easily be attacked. Thus it is a matter of national security to acquire these islands to serve as the Second Belt of Protection..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

reaching_for_the_pacific_MJN_desc;With our oceanic frontier secured, the time has come to cast our gaze further afield. The Pacific Ocean is filled with islands which would serve as excellent naval stations for both our merchant and military fleets. Since Zhourao was consolidated, scientific missions have conducted explorations across the region, charting its fantastic diversity of flora and fauna. As we know, foreign powers like those of Europe, Japan, and Qingqiu understand nothing of this, and will stop at nothing to deny us our rightful place within the Pacific. Therefore we must act first! The Third Belt of Protection must be secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Claiming_Canal_MJN_title;Claim the Isthmus of Andagoya;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Claiming_Canal_MJN_desc;The Andagoya Canal Project is nothing less than the most world-changing engineering concept in economic history. Whoever controls it will control the lifeblood of global trade, the gateway between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The military significance of such a canal is also obvious, allowing rapid movement of whole flotillas from the Caribbean to the Gulf of Caladero. If we want to preserve our power base within the Pacific Ocean then we must not allow any other power to maintain control over the isthmus of Andagoya. The security of Zhourao depends upon it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_String_of_Pearls_Chinese_Sea_title;The String of Pearls;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
the_String_of_Pearls_Chinese_Sea_desc;The expansion of transportation and communication technology has allowed our merchants to conduct business in traditional Chinese centers of trade across the South Sea of China like never before. From Shanghai to Singapore, our wares change hands in ever-increasing numbers. Yet these cities are increasingly dominated by interests of the foreign colonial empires of Europe, Japan, and even Qingqiu. We cannot allow the Chinese people to toil under the yoke of these invaders! The arbitration of Chinese trade belongs to the Chinese people alone. For these reasons, we must secure what has been dubbed the “String of Pearls,” the southern Chinese cities where some of our greatest business is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
aboriginal_citizens_title;Integration of the Hongshan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
aboriginal_citizens_desc;Hongshanman, or ‘red barbarians from the mountains’, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan. For centuries most of us believed that Hongshan were simply too different and too undeveloped to participate within our society. However, new scholarship surrounding the ancestry of Zhourao citizens suggests that the Hongshan are far more closely related to us than we thought. Therefore it is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that the Hongshan are somehow biologically or culturally incapable of being citizens if so many of our ancestors intermarried with them. Now a left-wing coalition within the Zongting has tabled a bill to completely enfranchise all Hongshan people. Despite furious opposition from conservatives we may just be able to force it through and put the Hongshan on an equal legal standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan. With the advancement of our society, it has become clear that we must ground our nation upon a solid foundation of egalitarian unity if we are to survive in a world dominated by foreign empires. The first step of ensuring this is to enshrine the Hongshan as full citizens of our nation. After all, many of our own people have Hongshan blood, and we have lived, fought, and worked alongside the Hongshan for generations. Yet many Hongshan still live in backwards societies unfit for the modern age. We must bring all of our countrymen into the light of civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Maori_citizenship_title;Maori Citizenship Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Maori_citizenship_desc;The Maori have resided on the islands of Changyun and Cuiyan since time immemorial, where they have developed a robust culture. Uncivilized as they are, their feats of art and architecture are unparalleled by any other society which our explorers have encountered in the Tàipíngyáng (Pacific Ocean). They maintain a strong martial element in their society that is admired by our own soldiers. So far as our researchers can tell, they are not closely related to the Hongshan. Nevertheless, they have recently established the foundations of civilization by coordinating beneath a united tribal council, and could develop separatist sentiments if we neglect them. Now that we have taken possession of their lands, we must integrate them just as we did the Hongshan, and bestow all of the fruits of modernity upon their society. We must bring all of our countrymen into the light of civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Europeans_in_Zhourao_desc;After having eliminated the influence of foreign empires in Zhourao, we are left with the settler communities which they have created. Reactionaries would describe the Europeans of Zhourao as barbarians and potential traitors, yet we have traded with them for generations. Their presence on the continent is a fact of life. Therefore what is needed is not suppressive measures, as they so ignorantly inflicted upon the Hongshan, but rather education and integration into the proper Zhourao way of life. Let them follow their Christian faiths and speak French or Scandinavian amongst themselves, so long as they speak in a civilized tongue in public. We must bring all of our countrymen into the light of civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Melanesians_citizens_title;Melanesian Citizenship Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Melanesians_citizens_desc;Our expansion into the island of Papua has brought us into unprecedented contact with the Melanesian peoples. We are continually impressed by the ways in which their tribal societies thrive in such a harsh and unforgiving climate. While we have traded with them for generations, we are now beginning to take possession of the region, in order to defend it from foreign colonial regimes. Yet if we do not integrate them properly, they may turn against us - and we have enough stories of the individual prowess of their warriors to know how fierce their resistance could become. Furthermore, they have unfortunately not advanced beyond the rudimentary stages of development, something that must be corrected. We must bring all of our countrymen into the light of civilization!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Five_Races_under_One_Union_desc;Zhourao, Hongshan, Maori, Melanesian, and European : the Wuzú Gonghé, the Five Races under One Union. This is the principle which has been taken up by the liberals of our nation, the notion of egalitarian unity upon which they have staked their hopes for the future. It is an affirmation of the pursuit and maintenance of harmony. The concept of multi-ethnic balance is far from new within Chinese society. A similar principle, huáxià, united the ancestors of the Han to rise above the barbarians surrounding them and build a new society together. We, too, have now transcended our divisions and prejudices for the sake of a united Zhourao, and the defense of our homeland from foreign empires. Now, the time is right to open our arms to the peoples of the world! Come forth, we say, and build a new Zhourao with us, here in this great land of the Five Races under One Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Protector_Of_The_Faithful_ZSA_desc;To the north of Zhourao lie the islands of Nusantara, whose diverse population holds many fellow Shafi’i Sunni Muslims. ”Nusantara'' is the Old Javanese name for the archipelago, literally meaning “Outer Islands.” These lands have historically been some of the richest in Asia, but lately had been carved up by various colonial empires, who scorn and abuse their people to wring every last pound of profit from them. It is disgraceful that such honorable members of the Ummah should labor like beasts for the infidels! No longer! The caliphs of old may have faded into obscurity, but contrary to the beliefs of the decadent West, there still exist powers in the world who will stand up to wickedness. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, we must don the mantle of Protector of the Faithful and sound the trumpets of a new jihad to liberate all Nusantarans who dwell within the House of Islam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

In the past, we did not always treat them with the utmost respect, but now we must put such outdated perspectives aside. It is only right that we enshrine them as full citizens of our nation.

Promote_Bopomofo_desc;"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then Zhourao will die." - Hua Enlai, Zhourao author\nThe growing diversity and literacy of our nation has put pressure on our government to adopt an official transliteration system. The least radical approach would be to supplement traditional Chinese characters with Bopomofo. While shorthand is a common tool to condense information, Bopomofo (also known as Zhùyin) - named after the first four letters of its alphabet - is an ambitious new attempt to build a whole writing system out of the practice. It is composed of “regularized” forms of ancient Chinese characters, and each character represents a phone, or speech sound. While designed around Mandarin Chinese, it can be used for any Chinese language. Its supporters argue that this transliteration system is the swiftest way to absorb information in both a casual and an educational context. However many Zhourao leftists see adopting Bopomofo as a stop-gap measure which would only allow traditional Chinese to linger on without actually improving education and communication efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Promote_Romanization_desc;"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then Zhourao will die." - Hua Enlai, Zhourao author\nThe growing diversity and literacy of our nation has put pressure on our government to adopt an official transliteration system. By far the most radical proposal is to Latinize the alphabet. Proponents argue that the Latin alphabet has by now spread across the world, and that all other forms of transliteration would still be inexorably tied to our nation’s ethnic Zhourao majority. Therefore, they say, the only solution is to develop a uniform Latin alphabet for Zhourao Chinese. It is likely true that a Romanized, Latinized format of Chinese would be easier to learn and communicate with, especially for those not raised with it. However conservatives are aghast at the notion of formally abandoning Chinese characters themselves, insisting that the Chinese alphabet is one of our greatest ties to our ancient homeland. Some radicals turn this argument on its head by stating that it is precisely this nostalgic attachment to China which is preventing us from becoming a truly modernized society. Regardless it would take years, potentially decades to fully implement a Latinization of Zhourao Chinese and the process would require a far-reaching transformation of Zhourao media.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Promote_Simplified_Characters_desc;"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then Zhourao will die." - Hua Enlai, Zhourao author\nThe growing diversity and literacy of our nation has put pressure on our government to adopt an official transliteration system. One proposal is to adopt simplified Chinese characters. Simplified forms of Chinese characters have existed since the Qin Dynasty nearly two thousand years ago. An influential group of educational reformers are now promoting the development and government support of a more standardized format of these simplified characters. They argue that the adoption of such a system would make education swifter and easier, while also preserving more legibility in mass-produced media and thus strengthening our cultural presence. Conservatives object that adopting simplification will merely result in a “dumbing-down” of written Chinese, and that the process of determining the given “meaning” of a character would be arbitrary and would severely harm a language renowned for its nuance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Even now, dozens of nationalities lie imprisoned under their control. We cannot tolerate this any longer! Whatever guise they wear, we know the truth of their intentions, and we shall not stand idle while they advance their agenda of domination. With our new position in Asia we now have the power to strike at their imperial heartland and shatter their hegemony.

INDO1.T;The Second Khmer Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.D;Udaraja III has reigned for ten years in the Khmer Empire and yet he only sees a tiny Kingdom in place of what was once a great empire! Alas, the failures of the glorious Khmer Empire during the 18th Century had resulted in a catastrophic period of troubles that lasted for twenty seven years between 1749 and 1776 and had tore the second empire to pieces. With the empire effectively crippled and in a state that has not been seen since the bleak days of the Khemer Dark Ages (after the Collapse of the First Empire). One would think that it was unable to rise again. However rumours are spreading that the King of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.A;For Angkor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.T;The Kingdom of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.D;The Kingdom of Champa has maintained its independence from both Dai Vet and the Second Khmer Empire for over eighty years now, but the dynasty of Champa is currently weak. As it turns out, the current king of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease with no known cure and the only heir is two years old. Already vultures are circling the throne and waiting for his inevitable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.A;The nation is doomed! (GAME OVER IS LIKELY);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.T;The Collapse of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.D;The King of Champa has been suffering from a terrible illness for months and today he has finally passed away. The only heir was a two year old whom displeased the military enough to result in them immediately declaring the abolition of the monarchy with the insane excuse that Asia needed to move into a age of modernity away from monarchies, even as they seize power themselves and proclaim a dictatorship. This intolerable fact has resulted in the region of Champa breaking away and joining the Empire of Dai Nam and the rest being left as prey to a Khmer Empire that is expecting its restoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.A;The President will save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO4.T;The Succession of the Region of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INDO4.A;That was easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.T;The Death of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.D;Uaraja III has declared that the Republic of Champa shall be dissolved and annexed into the Khmer Empire directly. All young men must join up in this mission to scare away European ideas and "liberalism" from Asia! Indeed, this should be the first step in the restoration of the Second Khmer Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.A;Hurrah!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.T;Missionaries in Cochinchina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.D;The collapse of Champa was likely to have consequences. The most obvious was that of it being considered prime territory for European missionaries seeking to convert individuals to their belief systems. The greatest concentration of these missionaries are in the ports of Cochinchina and it is likely that there could be major issues in the future if any European power takes direct interest in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO6.A;Hopefully nobody notices..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.T;A strange request from Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.D;Some of our missionaries in Cochinchina have had enough of the persecution of their missions and have requested that we directly intervene. They have asked us to request the local government in the Cochinchina region to seek protectorate status away from whatever indochinese empire is oppressing them. It is likely that we should be able to easily acquire that territory without any need for a colonial war in the region, but there is a chance that the empire owning that territory will not be pleased and start a war anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO8.T;Cochinchina Seized by $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.D;The local government in Cochinchina has requested protectorate status from $FROMCOUNTRY$ and has been officially granted it. As a result the entire region has broken off from our empire and $FROMCOUNTRY$ states that if we take any effort to recover the territory then we will have to fight them for it. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European country, this war may be considered suicidal by nature and it is likely that if we attempted to fight them then we would lose. However, losing territory and not doing anything about it is considered extremely non-prestigious and will harm our empire in more ways then just territorial loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.A;We will attempt to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.B;Let them have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.T;The Return to Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.D;The Hindustan Conference had only demonstrated that India needed civilization to effectively resemble modernity. However, to the east of India is the region of Indochina which has been known to be far more bloody and self-destructive then India in even its worst periods of history. $COUNTRY$ should attempt to provide Indochina with the same level of civilization as afforded to the Indians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.A;Onto Civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ wants Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded that we cede the Region of Champa to them on the basis that we have no right to occupy a territory that was rightfully part of the Kingdom of Champa. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European nation, attempting to refuse would result in a deadly war that we would be unlikely to win. However allowing further territory in Indochina to be taken by a European nation would be a exceptionally bad idea if one wanted to maintain independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.A;We cannot fight them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.B;Not one more province. Fight them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
INDO11.T;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO11.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to us demanding that we sign their so called: "Treaty to maintain stability and civilized society in Indochina". This treaty effectively partitions our nation and allows $FROMCOUNTRY$ full control over our economy and foreign policy. Signing this treaty would be a death sentence. Fighting back would also likely be a death sentence. Die or die gloriously, these are our only choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INDO13.D;$COUNTRY$ has been pressuring Dai Nam into signing a unequal treaty designed to stabilize the region with the expectation of foreign investment. However, this treaty is extremely unequal and is designed to partition and weaken Indochina to the point where it would be easily possible for the complete subjugation of the region to European interests. Unfortunately Dai Nam has been forced to sign this unequal treaty, either though capitulation on the matter or having it enforced after a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Gabor I was not a ambitious man and never had any children or close relatives to speak of, the Duchy of Nitria after all was not a prestigious title. This has caused succession issues that will have to be solved with a Regency Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

HUN17.T;Springtime in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN17.D;The Hungarian regency council has been unable to select a replacement king after the death of Gabor I and have practically resorted to bickering between each other for little or no reason. The liberal revolutions that have spread throughout Europe have taken a interest in this predicament and have promptly declared the Kingdom of Hungary effectively dead as they have committed to a coup d'etat that has taken out both the regency council and the entire "reactionary" government with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265417.A;For the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.T;A Alternative Option;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.D;Rather then search for a hard-to-find survivor of a long-dead Hungarian dynasty or risk further falling into Bohemian influence by crowning a member of the Jagellion Dynasty, we could crown the Duke of Austria as the King of Hungary and create a union between us and them. Its a controversial option and has a lot of opposition but the potential of effectively taking over German territory via a personal union is extremely tempting. Of course, we could just crown a member of the Jagellions or continue searching for a Hungarian heir but this is a option that would guarantee a quick heir rather then being forced to wait for the regency council to come up with a valid Hungarian heir or fall into the Bohemian Sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN19.D;A envoy from the Kingdom of Hungary has unexpectedly offered the crown of Hungary to the Duke of Austria. This would effectively mean that as he is both the ruler of Hungary and Austria, we would form a union between both countries. The Hapsburg Dynasty has been looking for a greater title then that of the elective monarchy of the Commonwealth or the Duchy of Austria and the chance has finally arrived. A chance for the Dynasty to finally advance beyond its mediocre station as the Duke of Austria and into greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN21.T;The Creation of Transleithania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN21.D;The succession crisis that has plagued Hungary since the death of Gabor I has finally come to a end in a way that nobody could have ever hoped to expect beforehand: The Duke of Austria has been crowned in $CAPITAL$ as both the King of Hungary and the Duke of Austria, creating a union between both Hungary and Austria and effectively merging the two nations into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265421.A;A proud moment for Hungary and the Hapsburg Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.T;News from Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.D;Hungary has been consulting with the Duke of Austria with the intent to form a "Union" between both nations. As Austria is a member state of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hungarians still own the Duchy of Nitria, it is our duty to respond in a manner which suits the prestige of our title as the Emperor and prime imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.A;Allow them. This could weaken the Revolutionaries in the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.B;The Duke of Austria must use the title: "King in Hungary".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.C;Hungary must relinquish the Duchy of Nitria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.D;Denied. Force them to relinquish Nitria if they ignore us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.T;Interjection from Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must use the title: "King in Hungary" and kneel before the Holy Roman Emperor at his palace in Prague. This would be extremely humiliating internationally and it is likely that we may even be thrown out of the world stage if we did so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.A;Kneel and take the title of "King in Hungary";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.B;Go to hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.C;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN24.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must give up the Duchy of Nitria if we wish to continue down this path. This was to be expected as Bohemia has been wanting that title returned to them ever since the Hungarian Revolution ended in the Duke of Nitria (who was a vassal of Bohemia) being crowned as the King of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.A;Return Nitria to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.B;Burn in hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN27.T;The Issue of Transleithania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN27.D;Either though revolution or congress we have formed the Danubian Confederation. However we have been unable to fully unite all Danubian territories under our banner due to the existence of the Kingdom of Transleithania, a blight on Europe. Many within Austria agree with the sentiment that Transleithania was a mistake and are ready to take up arms against their government with our direct support. However, doing so risks retaliation by Transleithania and since it is likely that other states in Europe are already preparing to go to war with us: adding Transleithania to this mess could be very dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.A;Tell them that it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.B;Tell them that it is time to unite with their German brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.T;The Austrian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.D;Vienna has fallen to a large group of Danubian nationalists intending to unify Austria with the newly formed Danubian Confederation. Unfortunately, before a counter-attack was possible many other cities and towns also fell which lead to our immediate withdrawal from Austria Proper. These events are likely the result of direct support by the Danubian Confederation to destroy our nation for the sake of German nationalism. If Transleithania does not act decisively and declare war on these rogue Austrians, it is likely that the Kingdom of Transleithania will collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.A;Declare War. NOW.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.B;Give Up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.T;The Hungarian Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.D;The Hungarian Regency Council had been created to choose a new king for the Kingdom of Hungary and it is clear that they had attempted to impose a Jagellion onto us. However, the fact that the Regency Council had attempted to crown a Jagellion was not lost on the military and there would not even be an announcement before the military marched right into the palace and wrested control of the government from the council. The Hungarian military does not tolerate fools who attempt to pull Hungary further into the sphere of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265430.A;The Junta will protect us from the Bohemian Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.T;Danubian Confederation Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.D;As we have been unable to recover Austria from the Danubian Confederation, it is practically inevitable that the collapse of this union will occur. Already there are many individuals questioning the continuation of this union in $CAPITAL$ and the government has already stated that it will be voting on the future of the union in the coming days. It is likely that they will vote Transleithania out of existence since there is nobody left from Austria to continue support of this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31530;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering such a union could alarm the powers of Europe to a great degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31531;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
